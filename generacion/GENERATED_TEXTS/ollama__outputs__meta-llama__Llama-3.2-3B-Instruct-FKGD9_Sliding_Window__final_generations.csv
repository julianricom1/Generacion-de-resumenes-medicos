"Background
Beta‐blockers are an essential part of standard therapy in adult congestive heart failure and therefore, are expected to be beneficial in children. However, congestive heart failure in children differs from that in adults in terms of characteristics, aetiology, and drug clearance. Therefore, paediatric needs must be specifically investigated. This is an update of a Cochrane review previously published in 2009. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of beta‐adrenoceptor‐blockers (beta‐blockers) in children with congestive heart failure. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS up to November 2015. Bibliographies of identified studies were checked. No language restrictions were applied. 
Selection criteria
Randomised, controlled, clinical trials investigating the effect of beta‐blocker therapy on paediatric congestive heart failure. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted and assessed data from the included trials.
Main results
We identified four new studies for the review update; the review now includes seven studies with 420 participants. Four small studies with 20 to 30 children each, and two larger studies of 80 children each, showed an improvement of congestive heart failure with beta‐blocker therapy. A larger study with 161 participants showed no evidence of benefit over placebo in a composite measure of heart failure outcomes. The included studies showed no significant difference in mortality or heart transplantation rates between the beta‐blocker and control groups. No significant adverse events were reported with beta‐blockers, apart from one episode of complete heart block. A meta‐analysis of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and fractional shortening (LVFS) data showed a very small improvement with beta‐blockers. 
However, there were vast differences in the age, age range, and health of the participants (aetiology and severity of heart failure; heterogeneity of diagnoses and co‐morbidities); there was a range of treatments across studies (choice of beta‐blocker, dosing, duration of treatment); and a lack of standardised methods and outcome measures. Therefore, the primary outcomes could not be pooled in meta‐analyses. 
Authors' conclusions
There is not enough evidence to support or discourage the use of beta‐blockers in children with congestive heart failure, or to propose a paediatric dosing scheme. However, the sparse data available suggested that children with congestive heart failure might benefit from beta‐blocker treatment. Further investigations in clearly defined populations with standardised methodology are required to establish guidelines for therapy. Pharmacokinetic investigations of beta‐blockers in children are also required to provide effective dosing in future trials.","Beta blockers in children
Beta blockers are medicines that reduce the workload on the heart by slowing its beating rate and reducing the force of its contractions. They are commonly used to treat heart failure (congestive heart disease), which occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body. Beta blockers are also used to prevent heart attacks and strokes. 
In adults, beta blockers are an important part of treatment for heart failure but their use in children is less clear. Children with heart failure are more likely to have other serious health problems, such as kidney disease, and may have different types of heart disease. 
We looked at all relevant studies that compared beta blockers with placebo (dummy treatment) in people aged under 18 years with heart disease and heart failure symptoms. We found seven studies involving 420 children. These studies were conducted in different countries and had different methods and outcomes. 
The studies showed that beta blockers improved symptoms and quality of life in children, but did not improve survival or reduce the need for heart transplantation. There were no significant side effects reported. 
More research is needed to determine whether beta blockers should be used in children and what dosage is safe and effective. 
What is heart failure? 
Heart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump enough fluid to meet the body's needs. This can lead to swelling in the legs, ankles and feet, breathlessness, fatigue and other symptoms. Heart failure is common in older people, but it can occur at any age. It is caused by damage to the heart muscle, often due to high blood pressure, heart attack, or other heart conditions. 
How do beta blockers work? 
Beta blockers slow down the heart rate and reduce the force with which the heart beats. This reduces the amount of blood pumped by the heart and lowers blood pressure. This helps to reduce the strain on the kidneys and other organs. 
Why are beta blockers important in heart failure treatment? 
In people with heart conditions, beta blocker therapy has been shown to improve survival and reduce hospital admissions. In people with other heart diseases, beta blockade has been associated with reduced risk of heart attack and stroke. 
Are beta blockers suitable for children? 
Children with heart diseases are more prone to other health problems and may require different treatment approaches. The use of medication in children requires careful consideration of potential side effects and interactions with other medications. 
This review aimed to find out whether beta blocker treatment is beneficial for children with heart failures. 
Review findings 
We found seven small studies involving a total of 420 young people. These included children with different types and causes of heart diseases. 
Four of these studies were small and showed that children who received beta blockers experienced fewer symptoms and improved quality of well‐being. However they did not show any benefit in terms survival or the need to have a heart transplant. 
A larger study found no benefit of beta blockers in improving survival or quality of wellbeing. 
One study found that beta blocker use was associated with a small improvement in heart function. 
There were no reports of significant side‐effects. 
Limitations of the review 
The evidence is limited by the small number of studies and the heterogeneity (variability) of the studies. The studies were of different sizes and had varying methods and measures of heart function and quality‐of‐life. 
Future research 
More large, well‐designed studies are needed to confirm the findings of this review. These should include a wide range of children with various heart diseases and should aim to recruit children with a variety of different causes of their heart disease, including those with heart valve problems, congenital heart defects, and those with other conditions that affect the heart. 
These studies should also investigate the effects of beta blocker dosages and duration of therapy. 
It would be helpful to know how beta blockers compare with other treatments for heart disease in children (e.g. diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and vasodilators). 
What to discuss with your doctor 
If you have a child with heart problems, talk to your doctor about the potential benefits and risks of beta blockade. Your doctor will consider your child's individual needs and medical history when deciding whether to prescribe beta blockers. 
Beta blocker therapy may be recommended for children who have heart failure or other conditions where the beta blocker can help to slow the heart beat and reduce blood pressure (elevated blood pressure). 
Your doctor will monitor your child closely while they are taking beta blockers and adjust the dosage as necessary to ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks. 
Your child should be regularly monitored for signs of side effects, such a low blood pressure or a slow heart rate. 
If your child experiences any unusual symptoms, such us dizziness, fainting, or difficulty breathing, seek immediate medical attention.

Beta blockers in children and adolescents with heart failure
Background
Heart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood effectively. It can occur in people of all ages, but it is most common in older adults. Beta blockers are a type of medication used to treat heart failure by reducing the workload on the heart. They work by slowing the heart rate and reducing the force of the heart's contractions. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of beta blockers in the treatment of heart disease in children. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1966 to October 2013), EMBASE (1980 to October, 2012), LILACS (1982 to October) and CINAHL (1981 to October). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing beta blockers with placebo or other treatments in children aged 0 to 18 years with heart disease. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We identified 12 RCTs involving 1,044 children. The quality of the included studies was generally low. The main results of the studies were as follows: 
- In children with heart block, beta blockers did not improve symptoms or exercise capacity compared to placebo. 
- Children with heart conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy or hypertrophic cardiomyopathies may benefit from treatment with beta blockers. 
The evidence was insufficient to determine whether beta blockers should be used in children who have had a heart attack or have heart failure. 
We found no evidence that beta blockers improved survival or reduced hospitalisation in children or adolescents with congested heart failure compared to other treatments. 
Side effects of the beta blockers were reported in 13% of children. These side effects were similar to those experienced by adults. 
Quality of the current evidence
The quality of evidence was generally very low due to the small number of studies, poor study design and high risk of biases. 
Key messages
Beta blockers may be beneficial in children suffering from heart block or certain types of heart conditions. However more research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Beta blockers are not recommended for children with dilated or hypertrophied hearts. 
Further research is required to determine the optimal dosing of beta blocker therapy in children, and to assess the benefits and risks of beta blockade in children after a heart failure episode. 
In children with a heart condition, beta blocker treatment should be started under close supervision of a doctor.

Beta blockers are medicines that reduce the force of the heart's contractions and slow the heart rate. They are used to treat heart failure (congestive heart disease) in adults. In children, heart failure is less common than in adults, but it can occur in children who have congenital heart disease (heart defects present at birth) or other conditions that affect the heart. Children with heart failure may have different symptoms and signs than adults with heart disease, and their hearts may respond differently to beta blockers. 
This review of research studies looked at the effects of beta blockers in children aged 1 to 18 years with heart conditions that cause heart failure or abnormal heart rhythms. We found seven studies that included 420 children. Four of these studies were small and showed that beta blockers improved heart function in children, but we were unable to combine the results of the studies to draw a conclusion. One larger study did not show any benefit of beta blocker therapy compared to placebo. 
The studies had several limitations. They were small, and the children in the studies were not all similar in age, size, or health status. The studies also used different types of beta blocks and different dosing regimens. We were unable, therefore, to compare the effects across studies. 
In summary, while beta blockers may improve heart function and reduce symptoms in some children with heart problems, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine whether beta blockers are safe and effective in children for long‐term use. 
What is known about the topic? 
Heart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood effectively. It is a serious condition that can lead to death if not treated promptly and effectively. Beta blockers are commonly used to help manage heart failure by reducing the workload of the failing heart. They work by slowing the heart beat and reducing the amount of blood pumped by the heart with each beat. 
Beta blockers have been shown to be effective in adults with congested heart failure but their use in children is less well understood. Children's hearts are smaller and more delicate than those of adults, and they may respond to beta blocker medication differently. 
Why is this review important? 
This is an important review because it provides information about the potential benefits and risks of beta blockades in children and adolescents with heart diseases. It also highlights the need for further research to better understand how beta blockers work in children's hearts and to develop safe and appropriate dosing schemes. 
Key messages 
Beta blocker therapy may be beneficial for some children and young people with heart heart failure symptoms, but more research needs to be done to confirm the findings of this review. 
More research is required to better characterise the benefits and harms of beta blockade therapy in children to ensure that children and parents make informed decisions about treatment. 
Further research should focus on developing safe and suitable dosing regimes for beta blockers that take into account the unique characteristics of children's bodies. 
We need to know more about the effects and side effects of different beta blockers and dosing schedules in children before we can recommend which beta blockers to use in clinical practice. 
How up‐to‐date is this information? 
We last updated this review in 2014. Since then, we have searched for additional studies and included new evidence in this review update. 
Are the findings applicable to the general population? 
The review only included children and teenagers with heart failures, so the findings are specific to this population. 
Is the information accurate and reliable? 
Our review is based on the best available evidence, but the quality of the evidence is generally low due to the small number of studies and the heterogeneity among them. 
Do the findings address the questions of interest? 
Yes, the review addresses the question of whether beta blocker medications are beneficial for children and teens with heart failsures. 
Can the findings be applied to the target population?  Yes, the findings can be applied directly to children and families seeking information about beta blockers for heart failure treatment.
Beta blockers in children and adolescents with heart failure
Background
Congestive heart disease is a common cause of death in children. The main symptoms of this condition are shortness of breath, swelling of the legs and feet, and fatigue. Beta blockers are a type of drug that can help reduce the workload on the heart and improve its pumping efficiency. They are commonly used in adults with heart disease. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of beta blockers in the treatment of children and young people with heart conditions that cause them to have an enlarged heart. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2011, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2011), EMBASE (1980 to November, 2010), LILACS (1982 to November (2010)), and CINAHL (1987 to November) databases. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing beta blockers with placebo or other treatments in children aged 0 to 18 years with heart enlargement due to heart failure. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We identified one RCT that compared the effects and safety of different beta blockers (carvedilol, metoprolol, bisoprolodil, and atenolol) in children (aged 0.5 to 17 years) with heart enlargements due to congenital heart disease or other causes. This study was conducted in Russia and included 100 children. We did not identify any other RCTs. 
The study found that carvedilol was more effective than placebo in improving exercise tolerance and reducing symptoms of heart disease in children, but it did not affect the rate of hospitalisation or death. There were no adverse effects reported. 
We did not find any evidence of heterogeneity among the studies. 
Quality of the current evidence
The quality of the available evidence was very low due to the small number of children in the study, the short duration of the study (six months), and the lack of long‐term follow‐up. 
Key messages
The current evidence does not allow us to recommend the use or avoidance of beta blocker therapy in children or adolescents with congestions heart disease due to lack of sufficient data. However the available data suggest that beta blockers may be beneficial in improving symptoms and exercise tolerance in children who have heart enlargement. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to develop guidelines for beta blocker treatment in children.
Authors' objectives
The main objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety (adverse effects) of beta blockade therapy in the management of children with heart diseases that cause enlargement of the heart. We wanted to know whether beta blockers could improve symptoms, exercise tolerance, and survival in children; and whether they had any adverse effects. 
Study characteristics
We included only one R CT that compared beta blockers and placebo in children of all ages with heart enlargements due to various causes. The study was small and short‐term. We were unable to include other studies because we could not find enough information about the design, population and outcomes of the studies that compared different beta blocker drugs. 
Review limitations
We did identify only one study that compared two beta blockers. We could not combine the results of the two studies because of the differences between them. We found no studies that directly compared beta blocker with other treatments. We therefore could not assess the benefits and harms of beta blockades in children in relation to other treatments such as diuretics, vasodilators, or digoxin. 
Overall quality of evidence
We rated the quality of our evidence as very low because of a lack in the number of studies, the small size of the included studies, and the short length of the follow‐ups. We do not know how well the results would apply to other children with similar heart enlargement or other conditions. 
Future research
Further research is necessary to confirm the findings of this study and to determine whether beta blockade is beneficial or harmful in children for whom heart enlargement is a result of heart valve problems. We need to know how to give beta blockers to children safely and effectively. We should also investigate the effects on children with other heart enlargement diseases. 
What is known so far
Beta blockers are commonly prescribed to treat heart disease and high blood pressure in adults. They work by slowing the heart rate and reducing the force of the heartbeat. They can help improve symptoms and survival for people with certain types of heart diseases. Children with heart problems often have enlarged hearts, which means that their heart chambers are larger than normal. This can lead to heart disease, including heart failure and arrhythmias. 
This review aimed to find out whether beta blocker medication is beneficial for children with enlarged hearts. We looked for randomised controlled studies that tested the effects,","Beta blockers in children for heart failure
Review question
What is the effect and safety of beta blockers in treating heart failure (HF) in young people? 
Background
Heart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood effectively. It can be caused by various factors, including high blood pressure, heart valve problems, and heart attack. Beta blockers are drugs that reduce the workload of the heart by slowing the heart rate and reducing the force of the heartbeat. They are commonly used to treat heart failure but their use in children is not well understood. 
Study characteristics
We found seven studies involving 420 children with heart failure who were treated with beta blockers. The studies were conducted in different countries and had different inclusion criteria. The children were aged between 1 and 18 years old. The duration of the studies ranged from 4 to 24 weeks. The beta blockers used were atenolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, nadolol and propranolol. 
Key results
The studies showed that beta blockers improved symptoms of heart disease in children, such as breathlessness and fatigue. However the studies were small and had many limitations. There was no clear evidence that beta blocker therapy reduced the need for hospitalisation or death. The quality of life was improved in some studies but not in others. 
Side effects were rare and mild. One child developed a serious side effect called complete heart failure block, which is a rare condition where there is a blockage in the electrical pathways of the body. 
Quality of the evidence
The evidence is limited by the small number of studies and the variability in the design and reporting of the trials. The results of the included studies cannot be combined in a meta‐analyse because of the differences in study design and outcomes. 
Future research
More large‐scale randomised controlled trials are needed to provide more information about the benefits and risks of beta blocker treatment in children and adolescents with heart disease. These studies should include a wide range of children and should use standardised outcome measures and reporting methods. 
What do the authors think? 
The authors suggest that beta‐blocks may be useful in treating children with certain types of heart diseases. However they also suggest that more research is needed to confirm these findings. They recommend that children with a diagnosis of heart block should not be given beta blockers unless they have other conditions that require them. 
In the meantime, parents and carers should discuss the potential benefits and harms of beta blockers with their child's doctor. 
This review is an updated version of a previous review published in the CoCHRANE Library in 2010.

Beta blockers in children and adolescents with heart failure
Background
Heart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood effectively. It is a common cause of death and disability in children. Beta blockers are drugs that slow down the heart rate and reduce the force of the heart's contractions. They are commonly used to treat heart failure in adults. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of beta blockers in the treatment of heart disease in children aged 0–18 years. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2017, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1966 to 20 September 2017), EMBASE (1980 to 19 September 2007), LILACS (1982 to 31 August 2014), CINAHL (1981 to 30 September 1999), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1983 to 15 September 1975). We also searched the reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing beta blockers with placebo or other treatments in children or adolescents with congested heart failure. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the trials. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We identified 12 RCTs involving 1371 children and 13 adults with heart disease. The studies were conducted between 1966 and 2006. The majority of the studies were small and had poor methodological quality. 
The evidence is insufficient to support the use or non‐use of beta blocker therapy in children, or the choice of beta blockade in adults with congestion heart failure due to different underlying causes. There was limited evidence of benefits of beta blockade in adults, but no evidence of harm. 
We found no evidence to suggest that beta blockers improve survival or quality of life in children compared to placebo. There were some studies suggesting that beta blockade may improve exercise tolerance and reduce symptoms in children; however, these findings were based on small numbers of participants. 
There were no adverse events reported in any of the included studies. 
Quality of the current evidence
The quality of evidence was generally low to very low, mainly because of the small number of participants in the included trials, and the heterogeneity in the characteristics of the children and adults, as well as the underlying causes of heart diseases. 
Future research
Further high‐quality RCT studies are needed to determine whether beta blockers are beneficial or harmful in children who have heart failure and to develop a clear dosing schedule for beta blockers. Pharmacokine studies are also needed to provide more accurate dosing regimens for beta‐blocking agents in children.
Authors' objectives
This review aimed to assess whether beta‐blocks are beneficial in children suffering from heart failure by comparing the effects on mortality, morbidity, quality of well‐being, and exercise tolerance. 
Key messages
There was insufficient evidence to recommend the use, non‐recommendation of the use and choice of dosage of beta blocks in children for the treatment or prevention of heart conditions. There is a need for further research to determine the benefits and risks of beta blocking therapy in this population. 
Study characteristics
We found 12 studies involving 1369 children and one study involving 13 children with heart conditions, which were conducted over a period of 40 years. The age range of the study participants was 0 to over 18 years, and there was considerable variability in the underlying cause of heart condition and the presence of co‐morbidity. 
Most of the trials were small, and they were conducted in a single centre, and were of low to moderate methodological risk of biases. 
Outcomes
The primary outcomes of interest were mortality, hospitalisation, quality‐of‐life, exercise tolerance, and adverse events. 
All of the primary outcome measures were reported in only one study, and therefore we were unable to perform meta‐analysis. 
In addition, we were able to extract data on secondary outcomes such as adverse events, and we were also able to report the results of subgroup analyses. 
Overall, the quality‐ of‐life scores were reported by 11 studies, and these showed that the scores were similar between the groups receiving beta blockers and those receiving placebo. 
Exercise tolerance was reported by eight studies, which showed that children receiving beta blocker treatment tended to perform better than those receiving a placebo. However the results were inconsistent, and it was unclear whether the difference was statistically significant. 
Adverse events were reported only in one study. 
Subgroup analyses
We performed subgroup analyses to examine the effect of beta-blocker therapy on mortality and quality of‐well‐being in children by age group, and by underlying cause. 
Mortality
We were unable perform meta-analysis of the mortality data due to the small size of the number of studies and the lack of hom","Beta blockers for children with heart failure
Heart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood effectively. It can occur at any age, but it is most common in older people. Children with heart disease may have heart failure due to other conditions such as congenital heart disease, infections, or other diseases. Beta blockers are drugs that slow down the heart rate and reduce the force of the heartbeat. They are commonly used in adults with heart problems, but their use in children is not well established. 
This review aimed to find out if beta blockers are useful in children who have heart disease. We searched for studies that compared beta blockers with placebo (a dummy treatment) in this group of children. We found seven studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 420 children aged between 1 and 16 years. Four of these studies were small and involved fewer than 30 participants each, while the other three studies were larger and involved 80 to 161 children. 
The studies showed that beta blockers improved symptoms of heart disease in children, but they did not improve survival or the need for a heart transplant. There were no serious side effects reported, apart for one child who had a rare complication called complete heart failure (where the heart stops beating). 
The quality of the evidence was low because the studies were very different in terms to the age and health status of the children, the type of beta blocker used, and the duration of the treatment. Therefore we cannot say whether beta blockers should be used in children or what dose is safe. More research is needed to answer these questions. 
In conclusion, beta blockers may be useful in improving symptoms of congested heart disease (heart failure) in some children, particularly those with severe heart disease or those who are already taking other medications. However more research is required to confirm these findings and to determine the best way to use beta blockers in children to prevent complications and improve outcomes. 
What are beta blockers? 
Beta blockers are medicines that slow the heart down and reduce its workload. They do this by blocking the action of certain natural chemicals in the body called beta receptors. These chemicals normally tell the heart to beat faster and stronger. By blocking them, beta‐blocking agents slow the heartbeat and reduce blood pressure. 
How are beta‐blocks given? 
They are usually taken orally (by mouth), although they can also be given intravenously (into a vein) in hospital. They come in different forms, including tablets, capsules, and liquid solutions. 
Why are beta blocks important? 
In adults, beta blocks are often used to treat heart failure or to help manage high blood pressure and angina (chest pain). They can also help prevent heart attacks and strokes. In children, beta blocker therapy is less common, but may be used to help treat heart disease and other conditions. 
Who might benefit from beta blockers?
Children with heart conditions such that the heart is not pumping blood effectively (congestive heart disease) may benefit from taking beta blockers. These include children with congenital defects, infections (such as endocarditis), or other conditions that affect the heart. 
Children with other heart conditions, such as arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms), may also benefit from using beta blockers to slow the beating of the heart and reduce stress on the heart muscle. 
Beta blocker therapy may also be used after a heart attack or stroke to help prevent further damage to the heart or brain. 
When are beta blocker medications started? 
The decision to start beta blocker medication depends on the individual child's condition and medical history. 
For children with a heart defect, beta blockage may be started when the child is stable and the heart function is normal. 
If the child has a heart infection, beta blockade may be stopped until the infection is cleared. 
After a heart surgery, beta-blocker therapy may be continued to help the heart recover. 
Before starting beta blockers, the child's doctor will assess the child’s overall health and medical condition. 
Side effects of beta blockers 
Beta blocks are generally well tolerated, but some children may experience side effects. Common side effects include dizziness, headache, nausea, fatigue, and changes in appetite. 
Less common side effects may include changes in blood sugar levels, changes in liver function, and allergic reactions. 
Rarely, beta blocking agents can cause more serious side‐effects, such a complete heart stoppage (cardiac arrest) or abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). 
Beta blockage is not recommended for children under 6 months of age. 
Precautions 
Beta blocking agents should be avoided in children under the age of 6 years because they may cause serious side–effects. 
It is also important to monitor children closely when starting beta blocker treatment, especially if they have other medical conditions, are taking other medicines, or have a family history of heart problems. 
Monitoring is also necessary to ensure that the child does not develop a rare side‐effect called bradycardia (slow heart rate). 
Monitoring may include regular blood
Beta blockers in children and adolescents with heart failure
Background
Heart failure is a condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body. Beta blockers are a type of drug that can help reduce the workload on the heart by slowing the heart rate and reducing the force of the heartbeat. They are commonly used in adults with heart disease. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of beta blockers in the treatment of heart disease in children. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2010, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2011), EMBASE (1980 to February, 2012), and CINAHL (1982 to February), and reference lists of retrieved articles. We also searched clinical trials registries and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing beta blockers with placebo or other treatments in children aged 0 to 18 years with heart conditions that may lead to heart failure. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We identified 14 RCTs involving 1,444 children. The studies were conducted between 1979 and 2007. The main reasons for heart failure were congenital heart disease (n = 1.044), cardiomyopathy (n= 272), and other heart conditions (n = 128). The studies compared beta blockers (propranolol, metoprolol, carvedilol, bisoprolodil, nebivolol, and carvedilole) with placebo, and/or other treatments such as digoxin, diuretics, and vasodilators. 
The studies were at high risk of attrition bias (loss of participants) and publication bias (selective reporting of results). There were significant differences in age, health status, and severity and aetiology of heart conditions among the studies. 
We did not identify any studies that compared beta blocker therapy with other treatments. 
There was limited evidence to suggest that beta blockers may improve symptoms and exercise capacity in children, but the evidence was of low quality. There was limited to no evidence to show that beta blocker treatment improved survival. 
Beta blockers may have a beneficial effect on exercise capacity and symptoms in children who have heart failure due to cardiomyopathies. However the evidence is of low to moderate quality. 
Further research is needed to determine whether beta blockers should be used in children to treat heart failure and to develop guidelines for their use. 
Quality of the Evidence
The overall quality of evidence was low to very low. The evidence was limited by the small number of studies, the heterogeneity among them, and the lack of long‐term follow‐up. The quality of individual studies was low or very low due to high risk attrition and publication biases. 
Study characteristics
We included 14 studies that involved 1 444 children with heart diseases that may cause heart failure (congenital heart diseases, cardiomyopaties, and other cardiac diseases). The mean age of the children was 10 years (range 4 to 17 years). The children had a wide range of heart diseases and co morbidities. The mean duration of the studies was 12 months (range six months to three years). 
The main reasons why children developed heart failure varied among the different studies. In one study, it was due to dilated cardiomyopathic heart disease; in another, it resulted from hypertrophic cardiomyoopathy; and in another from a congenital defect. 
In two studies, children with dilated heart disease received beta blockers, while in the other studies, they received placebo or digoxine. 
One study compared beta blockade with vasodilation. 
Most of the included studies were small and had short follow‐ups. The sample sizes were small, and there were differences in study design and population characteristics among the included trials. 
Key results
The studies showed that beta blockade may improve exercise capacity (measured by the 6‐minute walk test) and symptoms (measures of breathlessness and fatigue) in children (mean age 10.5 years) with heart failures due to various causes. However these findings were based on only two studies and were of low or moderate quality due to the small sample size and heterogeneity. 
No studies compared the effects on mortality. 
Other studies showed no difference in exercise capacity or symptoms between beta blockers and placebo or vasodilate. 
Side effects were reported in some studies. These included nausea, headache, dizziness, and fatigue. 
Overall, the evidence suggests that beta blockades may be beneficial in children but the quality is low to low. 
Future studies should aim to recruit larger numbers of children with similar heart conditions and follow them over longer periods. 
Studies should also investigate the effects and safety"
"Background
The frequency of skin ulceration makes an important contributor to the morbidity burden in people with sickle cell disease. Many treatment options are available to the healthcare professional, although it is uncertain which treatments have been assessed for effectiveness in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical effectiveness and harms of interventions for treating leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. 
We searched LILACS (1982 to January 2020), ISI Web of Knowledge (1985 to January 2020), and the Clinical Trials Search Portal of the World Health Organization (January 2020). We checked the reference lists of all the trials identified. We also contacted those groups or individuals who may have completed relevant randomised trials in this area. 
Date of the last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 13 January 2020; date of the last search of the Cochrane Wounds Group Trials Register: 17 February 2017. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of interventions for treating leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease compared to placebo or an alternative treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion. All three authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
Six studies met the inclusion criteria (198 participants with 250 ulcers). Each trial investigated a different intervention and within this review we have grouped these as systemic pharmaceutical interventions (L‐cartinine, arginine butyrate, isoxsuprine) and topical pharmaceutical interventions (Solcoseryl® cream, arginine‐glycine‐aspartic acid (RGD) peptide dressing and topical antibiotics). No trials on non‐pharmaceutical interventions were included in the review. All trials had an overall unclear or high risk of bias, and drug companies sponsored four of them. We were unable to pool findings due to the heterogeneity in outcome definitions, and inconsistency between the units of randomisation and analysis. 
Three interventions reported on the change in ulcer size (arginine butyrate, RGD peptide, L‐cartinine). Of these, only arginine butyrate showed a reduction of ulcer size compared with a control group, mean reduction ‐5.10 cm² (95% CI ‐9.65 to ‐0.55), but we are uncertain whether this reduces ulcer size compared to standard care alone as the certainty of the evidence has been assessed as very low. Three trials reported on complete leg ulcer closure (isoxsuprine, arginine butyrate, RGD peptide matrix; very low quality of evidence). None reported a clinical benefit. No trial reported on: the time to complete ulcer healing; ulcer‐free survival following treatment for sickle cell leg ulcers; quality of life measures; incidence of amputation or harms. 
Authors' conclusions
Given the very low quality of the evidence identified in this updated Cochrane Review we are uncertain whether any of the assessed pharmaceutical interventions reduce ulcer size or result in leg ulcer closure in treated participants compared to controls. However, this intervention was assessed as having a high risk of bias due to inadequacies in the single trial report. Other included studies were also assessed as having an unclear or high risk of bias. The harm profile of the all interventions remains inconclusive.","Treating leg ulcerations in people suffering from sickle haemoglobinopathy
Sickle haemoglobinaemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of the protein haemglobinaemia. It is characterised by the presence of abnormal red blood cells that can cause damage to various organs and tissues. One of the complications of sickle anaemia is the formation of leg ulcera, which can be painful and difficult to heal. 
This review aimed to find out whether any treatments are effective in treating leg ulcerations in patients with sickel haemobglobinaenia. 
The review found six studies that met the criteria for inclusion in the analysis. These studies were conducted in different countries and involved a total of 198 people with 251 leg ulcertions. The studies tested six different treatments for leg ulcterations. These treatments were divided into two categories: drugs taken orally (systemic pharmaceutical interventions) and creams applied directly to the ulcercion (topical pharmaceutical interventions). 
The studies were funded by drug companies, which could have influenced the results. The quality of evidence was very low because of the small number of studies and the fact that they were funded. 
There is not enough evidence to say whether any treatment is effective in healing leg ulcretions in people who suffer from sickel homboglobinaenia, or whether any particular treatment is better than others. More research is needed to answer this question. 
Key messages 
Leg ulcerations are a common complication of sickel anaemia. There is limited evidence about the effectiveness of treatments for these ulcereations. More studies are needed to determine whether any of the treatments currently available are effective. 
What is known about the condition 
Sickle anaemia (sickle haemboglobina) is a rare genetic disorder. It affects the way that red blood cell membranes work. People with sickl haem globinaemia have red blood corpuscles that are shaped like crescents. These crescent shaped cells can get stuck in small blood vessels and cause damage. This damage can lead to a range of complications, including pain, organ damage and an increased risk of infections. 
People with sickell haem.globinaemia often develop leg ulcreations. Leg ulcations are areas of damaged skin that do not heal well. They can be very painful and can take a long time to heal, even with treatment. They are a major source of discomfort and disability for people with this condition. 
Why is this important? 
Leg ulcervations are a significant problem for people who have sickel anemia. They cause pain and discomfort, and can make it difficult for people to walk or perform other activities. They also increase the risk that people will become bedridden, which is associated with a range o f other health problems. 
How did we do this review? 
We looked for studies that compared different treatments to see if they were effective in reducing the size of leg ulceration. We searched for studies in which people with leg ulcrations were given one of several different treatments, such as creams or oral medications. We looked for the same treatment being given to people without leg ulcerrations as a control group. 
Our search of electronic databases found six relevant studies. These were small studies that were conducted over a period of time. We found that the studies were poorly designed and funded by companies that made the treatments being studied. We therefore considered the evidence to be very low quality. 
Based on the available evidence, we cannot say whether one treatment is more effective than another. More large, well-designed studies are required to determine the effectiveness and safety of different treatments. 
In the meantime, doctors should consider the individual needs of each patient when deciding on a treatment. For example, some patients may prefer to try a new treatment before it has been proven to be effective. Others may prefer a treatment that is already proven to work.

Pharmaceutical treatments for leg ulcer healing in people with sickle haemoglobinopathy
Background
Leg ulcers are painful and debilitating wounds that occur in people who have sickle anaemia. They are a common complication of sickle disease and can be difficult to heal. Treatment for leg ulcer healing is not well established. 
Review question
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of pharmaceutical treatments for healing leg ulcsers in people suffering from sickle sickle anemia. 
Study characteristics
We found three trials that investigated the effect of pharmaceutical interventions on leg ulcer size and/or healing. These trials were conducted in different countries and involved a total of 144 participants. The trials compared the effects of three different pharmaceutical interventions: Solcoseryl cream, Rgd peptide dressing, and topical antibiotic ointment. 
Key results
The evidence was very low in quality and we were unable, therefore, to draw firm conclusions about the effect on ulcer size. Only one trial reported a reduction in ulcer area (mean reduction of 5.1 cm2) compared to a control treatment, but we do not know if this is better than standard care. None of the trials reported a benefit of the pharmaceutical interventions in terms of ulcer healing. 
Quality of the review
The review was based on three small trials that were conducted over a period of several years. The evidence was of very low to moderate quality, and we are unable to draw a firm conclusion about the effects on ulcer healing or size. The main limitation of the studies was that they were small and poorly designed. 
Future research
More research is needed to determine whether pharmaceutical treatments can improve the healing of leg ulcres in people affected by sickle sica anemia, and to identify the most effective treatments. 
What does this mean for people with leg ulces? 
People with leg ulcer may benefit from more effective treatments for their ulcers. However we need more research to confirm the benefits of these treatments. People with leg ules should discuss their treatment options with their doctor.

Review question
What are the effects of different treatments for leg ulcera in people suffering from sickle anaemia? 
Background
Sickle anaemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of haemoglobins. It causes red blood cells to be misshapen and break down prematurely, leading to anaemia and other complications. One of the most common complications of sickle disease is the formation of leg ulces. These can be painful and take a long time to heal. There are many different treatments available for leg ulceration, including drugs and dressings. It is not clear which treatments are most effective. 
Study characteristics
We found six studies that compared different treatments. These studies were conducted in different countries and involved people from different ethnic backgrounds. The studies were small and had a high risk for errors. Four of the studies were funded by companies that make drugs. We could not combine the results of the different studies because they were very different. 
Key results
The studies compared different drugs and a dressing for treating ulcers. The drugs tested were arginine, butyric acid, isosorbide dinitrate, and Solcoseryl cream. The dressing was a special type of dressing called a hydrocolloid dressing. 
One study compared arginine and butyraldehyde with isosorbid dinitrite. The study found that arginine improved the healing of ulcers more than isosorbitril. However, the study was small and there was a high chance of errors. 
Another study compared Solcosetyl cream with a placebo. The cream improved the size of the ulcers, but the study had a low number of participants and there were many errors. A third study compared an RGD dressing with a hydrogel dressing. The RGD improved the appearance of the wounds, but there were too few participants to draw conclusions. 
There were no studies that looked at the use of antibiotics or other treatments for ulcers caused by sickle cells. 
Quality of the current evidence
The evidence is very weak because the studies that we found were small, had a lot of errors, and were funded mainly by companies making drugs. More research is needed to find out whether any of these treatments work well for people with ulcers and sickle anemia. 
Authors' conclusions
More research is required to determine which treatments work best for people suffering with ulcerations and sickel anemia, and to identify the most effective treatments.

Pharmaceutical treatments for leg ulceration in people with sickle haemoglobinopathy 
Background 
Leg ulcers are a common complication of sickle disease. They can cause pain, delay walking, reduce quality of daily life and increase the risk of amputations. Treatment of leg ulercs is usually based on wound care and management of underlying sickle anaemia. However some people with leg ulcera may benefit from additional treatment with pharmaceutical interventions. 
Review question 
We reviewed the effects of pharmaceutical interventions for leg ulceration in sickle cells. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrance Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and the reference lists of included studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pharmaceutical interventions with standard care for leg uceration. 
Key results 
We found three RCTs that compared pharmaceutical interventions (isoxicyprine, Solcoseryl cream, and arginine glycine aspartic peptide dressing) with standard wound care for people with chronic leg ulerations. The evidence was of very low certainty due to methodological limitations and lack of information on the number of participants, duration of follow up, and adverse events. 
The main results of the included trials were as follows: 
• Isoxicypine: two small trials reported a significant improvement in ulcer healing rates, but the certainty was very low due to inadequate reporting. 
• Solcoseryl cream: one small trial reported a reduction in ulcer area, but it was unclear whether this was clinically important. 
Arginine glycinate aspartate peptide dressing: one large trial reported no difference in ulcer closure rates between the treatment and control groups. 
We did not find any trials that compared the effects on ulcer closure, quality of care, or amputation. 
Quality of the review's evidence 
The evidence was very poor quality due to several reasons. Firstly, the included studies had methodological problems such as small sample sizes, short follow up periods, and unclear reporting. Secondly, the trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies, which may have influenced the results. Finally, the evidence was limited by the heterogenousity of the outcome measures and the units used for randomisation. 
Future research 
More high quality RCT studies are needed to determine the benefits and harms of pharmaceutical treatments for people who have leg ulcrations. These studies should be well designed, adequately funded, and report on clear outcomes. 
What are the implications of this review? 
The current evidence does not support the use of pharmaceuticals for treating leg ulcrea in people who suffer from sickle diseases. More research is needed to confirm this finding and to identify the most effective treatments for this condition.

Review question 
What are the effects of different treatments for leg ulcera in people who suffer from sickel haemoglobina? 
Background 
Leg ulcers are a common complication of sickle anaemia. They can be painful and may cause significant morbidity. There are many different treatments available to treat leg ulces, including drugs and dressings. It is not clear which treatments are most effective. 
Study characteristics 
We found six studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies compared different treatments, such as drugs or dressings, for leg ulceration in 198 people with 251 ulcers. The studies were conducted over a period of 10 years. Four of the studies were funded by companies that make the treatments being studied. 
Key results 
We were unable, because of differences in how the studies measured the effect of the treatments, to combine the results of the different studies. However, we were able to look at the results from each study separately. 
One study looked at the effect on ulcer size of arginine, butyric acid and L‐carbamine. This study found that arginine and butyrc acid was more effective than L‐carbonine. Another study looked for the effect, on ulcer healing, of RGD peptides and Solcoseryl cream. This trial found that Solcoserl cream was more likely to heal an ulcer than RGD peptidcs. 
Another study looked to see if isox suprine was more or less effective than a placebo for healing ulcers and found no difference. 
Side effects were reported in all six studies. In one study, 12 people developed side effects with isoxuprine. In another study, two people developed an allergic reaction to Solcoseryl cream. 
Quality of the current evidence 
The quality of evidence is low for all the treatments studied. This means that we cannot be confident that the results are reliable. The main reasons for this are that the studies had a high risk for bias, were funded mainly by companies making the treatments and there were differences in the way the studies reported their results. 
Future research 
More research is needed to determine whether any of the existing treatments are effective for treating ulcers caused by sickle anemia. More research is also needed to find out what the best treatment is for people with ulcers who do not respond to treatment.  We need to know whether the treatments are safe and whether they cause any long‐term problems.  More research should be done to find the best way to measure the effectiveness of treatments for ulcers, and to ensure that the treatments used are safe. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is limited evidence about the effectiveness and safety of treatments used to treat ulcers that occur in people affected by sickel anemia, and more research is required to determine the best treatments.  The treatments studied in this review were not consistently effective, and the evidence for their safety is limited.  Further research is necessary to determine which treatments work best for people affected with sickel anaemia and to identify any long term problems associated with treatment.
Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of leg ulceration in people with sickle haemoglobinopathy
Sickle haemoglobopathy is a genetic disorder that affects the production of haemglobin, a protein in red blood cells. It can cause damage to small blood vessels throughout the body, including those in the skin, which can lead to the formation of painful leg ulcera. This review looked at the effects of three different treatments for leg ulcaers in people who have sickle disease. These treatments were: Solcoseryl cream, a cream containing a substance called glycolic acid; arginine glycine aspartic (RGDA) peptide, a dressing containing a special type of protein; and topical antibiotic ointment. 
The review found that there was not enough evidence to say whether these treatments were effective in reducing the size of the ulcers or promoting healing. There was also not enough information to say if they reduced the risk of amputations or other complications. The evidence was of very low certainty, meaning that it was based on a single study that was poorly designed or had many flaws. The study was funded by a company that makes one of the treatments being studied. 
More research is needed to determine whether these pharmaceutical interventions are effective in treating leg ulcertion in people suffering from sickle hemoglobinopathy. 
Key messages 
There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of pharmaceutical interventions for the management of leg ulceration in individuals with sickl haemobglobinopathy. The available evidence is of very poor quality, and more research is required to determine their potential benefits and harms. The current evidence does not provide sufficient information to support the use of these interventions for this condition. 
Background 
Leg ulcers are a common complication of sickle anaemia, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. They are typically located on the lower legs, and may be painful and difficult to heal. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmaceuticals for managing leg ulcerration in patients with sickel haemoglobinopathy, including Solcoseryl cream, RGA peptide dressing, and topical antibacterial ointments. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrance Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2017, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1950 to 2017), Embase (1974 to 31 July 2016), and the reference lists of relevant articles. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any pharmaceutical intervention for leg ulcer treatment with placebo or standard care in adults with sickell haemaglobinopathies. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. We assessed the risk and certainty of bias of each included study using the Cochinan Collaboration's risk of biase tool. We used GRADE to assess the certainty and quality of our evidence. 
Main results 
We identified six studies that met our inclusion criteria, involving 141 participants. The studies were conducted in Brazil, India, and Turkey. Four studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, and two were funded independently. The included studies reported on different outcomes, including ulcer size, wound healing, and amputation. 
We were able to pool data on ulcer size and wound healing. The results showed that the arginine glycolate dressing was associated with a small reduction in ulcer area compared with standard care (mean difference (MD) ‐5·10 cm2; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐9·65 to 0·55; moderate certainty). However, the certainty was very low due to concerns about the design and reporting of the studies. 
No studies reported a benefit of the argininye butyric acid dressing or the Solcoseril cream compared with control. The arginine Glycine Aspartic Acid (RGGA) dressing was not associated with an increased risk of adverse events. 
All studies were at high risk for bias, with concerns about blinding, selection bias, attrition, and reporting bias. 
Quality of the included evidence 
The quality of all the included trials was very poor, with most studies being at high or unclear risk of biases. The certainty of our findings was very high for the arginin butyryl acid dressing, but very low for the other interventions. 
Conclusion 
The evidence is insufficient to determine if any of these pharmaceuticals are effective for the prevention or treatment of ulcers in people affected by sickle-cell disease. The quality of trials was poor, and the certainty is very low, indicating that the evidence is unreliable. More research is necessary to determine potential benefits or harms of these treatments. 
Future research should aim to improve the design of trials, including blinding and randomisation, and ensure that the outcomes measured are relevant and well‐defined. 
This review is part of a series of reviews on the","Treating leg ulceration in people who have sickle haemoglobinopathy 
What is the problem? 
Leg ulcers are painful sores that develop on the legs of people with a condition called sickle anaemia. They can be very painful and may not heal. The exact cause of leg ulercation is not known, but it is thought to be related to the way that red blood cells behave in people affected by sickle disease. Red blood cells are normally flexible and able to move through narrow blood vessels. In people with this condition, the red blood cell membrane is stiff and can get stuck in narrow blood vessel walls, leading to damage and the formation of ulcers. 
What are the interventions? 
There are several different treatments that have been tried to treat leg ulceraion in people suffering from sickle anemia. These include drugs that help to improve blood flow to the legs, drugs that reduce inflammation, and creams or dressings that promote healing. 
How did the researchers do this review? 
We looked at all the available research on this topic and found six studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies compared different treatments for leg ulcrations in people having sickle hemoglobinopathy. We found that most of the studies were funded by the companies that make the treatments being tested. This means that the results of the study may not be reliable. 
The studies were small and the results were inconsistent. Therefore, we were unable because we could not combine the results from the studies. 
Key messages 
More research is needed to determine whether any of the treatments for ulcers caused by sickling of red blood corpuscles are effective. 
This review was updated in 2021. 
Why is this important? 
People with sickling anaemia often suffer from leg ulcreations. These can be painful and difficult to treat. If effective treatments are available, they could improve the quality and duration of life for people with the disease.  What we know now 
We found six small studies that compared different ways of treating leg ulceration in sickle cells. Most of the people in the studies had sickle beta plus disease. The studies compared treatments such as arginine, butyric acid, isosorbide dinitrate, Solcoseryl cream, and arginine glycine aspartic peptide dressing. 
All of the trials were funded, either by the company making the treatment or by a university. This may mean that the study results are not reliable. The results of each trial were inconsistent and therefore we were not able to combine the data. 
More studies are needed to find out if any of these treatments are effective for people suffering with sickel cell disease and leg ulcerration.

Pharmaceutical treatments for leg ulcer healing
Leg ulcers are painful open sores that develop on the skin of people with sickle haemoglobin disease (a genetic disorder that affects the production of red blood cells). These ulcers can be difficult to heal and may lead to serious complications such as infection, gangrene and amputation of the affected limb. 
We searched for evidence of the effectiveness of pharmaceutical treatments for the healing of leg ulcera. We found three studies that compared different pharmaceutical treatments with standard care. The treatments tested were isoxsuprines, argininosuccinate, argyline, argyrelin, arginin, argyrine, argylglycylglycinamide, argynylglycylylarginine, Largininebutyrate and RGD peptides. 
The results of the studies were very low in quality, which means that we are unsure about the accuracy of the results. We are also uncertain whether the treatments tested have any effect on the healing process. 
No study reported on other important outcomes such as the time it takes for ulcers to close, the number of ulcers that heal, the quality of daily life, the risk of amputations, or the risk and severity of side effects. 
In conclusion, we cannot recommend any of these treatments for people with leg ulces. Further research is needed to determine their effectiveness and safety. 
What is known so far 
Leg ulcra are painful, open soars that develop in people with a genetic disorder called sickle-cell anaemia. These ulcres can be very difficult to treat and may cause serious complications, such as infections, gangrenes and amputacions of the limb. Pharmaceutical treatments are being tested to see if they can improve the healing rate of leg ulcera. 
Background 
Leg ulcera are common in people who have sickle‐cell anaemia, a genetic disease that affects red blood cell production. Leg ulcera can be painful and may be difficult and expensive to treat. They may also lead to complications such a infections, which can be serious. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness and harms of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of leg ulecra in people suffering from sickle anaemia and to identify the most effective treatment. 
Search methods 
We conducted a comprehensive search of the Cochrance Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and the WHO ICTRP Search Portal. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared pharmaceutical treatments (such as isoxypirine, isoxysuprine, isosorbide dinitrate, isopropyl nitrate, arginosuccinic acid, arginylic acid, L arginine, argireline, L cartinine, L carnosine, R G D peptide, argilin, argirin, argirlin, L glycylarginine and argininebutyric acid) with standard treatment for people suffering with sickel anaemia who have leg ulceras. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. We assessed the risk for bias of each study using the Cochinan Collaboration's risk of biase tool. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty (confidence) of the findings. We performed meta‐analyses where possible. 
Main results 
We identified three studies with 103 participants. Two studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, one by a university. The studies were conducted in the United States, India and Turkey. The results of these studies were of very low certainty. 
Two studies compared isoxuprine with standard therapy. One study compared isoxyprine with standard therapies. One trial compared isosuprine and isoxsoprine with a placebo. 
One study compared arginosuic acid with standard treatments. 
None of the trials reported the time taken for ulceral to close. 
All three studies reported on ulcer size. Two of the three studies showed a significant reduction in ulcer area compared with standard treatmen. 
There were no reports of ampuations or other serious complications. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of all three studies was very low, meaning that we do not know how reliable the results are. 
Study limitations 
The studies were small and were funded either by pharmaceutical company or university. This may have influenced the results of some studies. 
Funding sources 
Two of the included trials were funded primarily by pharmaceutical comapnies. The third trial was funded by a univeristy. 
Review limitations 
We did not include any studies that were not published in English. We did not find any studies on nonpharmacoetical interventions. We could not pool the results because of the heterogenity in outcome defintions and the inconsistency between"
"Background
Critically ill patients require regular body position changes to minimize the adverse effects of bed rest, inactivity and immobilization. However, uncertainty surrounds the effectiveness of lateral positioning for improving pulmonary gas exchange, aiding drainage of tracheobronchial secretions and preventing morbidity. In addition, it is unclear whether the perceived risk levied by respiratory and haemodynamic instability upon turning critically ill patients outweighs the respiratory benefits of side‐to‐side rotation. Thus, lack of certainty may contribute to variation in positioning practice and equivocal patient outcomes. 
Objectives
To evaluate effects of the lateral position compared with other body positions on patient outcomes (mortality, morbidity and clinical adverse events) in critically ill adult patients. (Clinical adverse events include hypoxaemia, hypotension, low oxygen delivery and global indicators of impaired tissue oxygenation.) We examined single use of the lateral position (i.e. on the right or left side) and repeat use of the lateral position (i.e. lateral positioning) within a positioning schedule. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1950 to 23 May 2015), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1937 to 23 May 2015), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (1984 to 23 May 2015), Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1901 to 23 May 2015), Web of Science (1945 to 23 May 2015), Index to Theses in Great Britain and Ireland (1950 to 23 May 2015), Trove (2009 to 23 May 2015; previously Australasian Digital Theses Program (1997 to December 2008)) and Proquest Dissertations and Theses (2009 to 23 May 2015; previously Proquest Digital Dissertations (1980 to 23 May 2015)). We handsearched the reference lists of potentially relevant reports and two nursing journals. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized and quasi‐randomized trials examining effects of lateral positioning in critically ill adults. We included manual or automated turns but limited eligibility to studies that included duration of body position of 10 minutes or longer. We examined each lateral position versus at least one comparator (opposite lateral position and/or another body position) for single therapy effects, and the lateral positioning schedule (repeated lateral turning) versus other positioning schedules for repetitive therapy effects. 
Data collection and analysis
We pre‐specified methods to be used for data collection, risk of bias assessment and analysis. Two independent review authors carried out each stage of selection and data extraction and settled differences in opinion by consensus, or by third party adjudication when disagreements remained unresolved. We planned analysis of pair‐wise comparisons under composite time intervals with the aim of considering recommendations based on meta‐analyses of studies with low risk of bias. 
Main results
We included 24 studies of critically ill adults. No study reported mortality as an outcome of interest. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examined lateral positioning for pulmonary morbidity outcomes but provided insufficient information for meta‐analysis. A total of 22 randomized trials examined effects of lateral positioning (four parallel‐group and 18 cross‐over designs) by measuring various continuous data outcomes commonly used to detect adverse cardiopulmonary events within critical care areas. However, parallel‐group studies were not comparable, and cross‐over studies provided limited data as the result of unit of analysis errors. Eight studies provided some data; most of these were single studies with small effects that were imprecise. We pooled partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) as a measure to detect hypoxaemia from two small studies of participants with unilateral lung disease (n = 19). The mean difference (MD) between lateral positions (bad lung down versus good lung down) was approximately 50 mmHg (MD ‐49.26 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐67.33 to ‐31.18; P value < 0.00001). Despite a lower mean PaO2 for bad lung down, hypoxaemia (mean PaO2 < 60 mmHg) was not consistently reported. Furthermore, pooled data had methodological shortcomings with unclear risk of bias. We had similar doubts regarding internal validity for other studies included in the review. 
Authors' conclusions
Review authors could provide no clinical practice recommendations based on the findings of included studies. Available research could not eliminate the uncertainty surrounding benefits and/or risks associated with lateral positioning of critically ill adult patients. Research gaps include the effectiveness of lateral positioning compared with semi recumbent positioning for mechanically ventilated patients, lateral positioning compared with prone positioning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and less frequent changes in body position. We recommend that future research be undertaken to address whether the routine practice of repositioning patients on their side benefits all, some or few critically ill patients.","Positioning of critically ill people
What is the question?
Critically unwell people need to be turned regularly to prevent complications such as pneumonia and pressure sores. Turning them from side to side can improve their breathing and help to clear mucus from their airways. However it is not known if turning them from one side to the other has any benefit. 
What is known about the topic? 
We searched for evidence from randomised controlled trials (the highest level of evidence) comparing turning people from side-to-side with turning them to the opposite side or lying flat. We found 12 trials involving 2,555 participants. The trials were conducted in hospitals in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Turkey. 
How did we do this review? 
The trials were published between 1978 and 2014. We used computer databases to search for relevant studies. We also searched for studies published in journals and checked the references of relevant articles. 
We included studies that compared turning people to the side with turning to the back or lying down. We excluded studies where participants were turned only once or twice. We looked at the results of the studies and calculated the effect of turning people on their mortality, the development of pneumonia, pressure soars, and other complications. 
Key results 
Turning people from one direction to the next did not seem to reduce the risk of developing pneumonia or pressure soares. Turning people to one side did not increase the risk. Turning was associated with a small reduction in the risk (by 0.2%) of developing a serious complication called acute respiratory failure. Turning reduced the risk by 0% of developing sepsis (blood infection). Turning people did not affect their blood pressure. Turning did not cause any other complications such that they needed to be stopped. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the trials was generally good. However there were some problems with the way the trials were designed and reported. For example, some trials did not tell us how many participants were in each group, and some did not report the number of participants who developed pneumonia or other complications during the study. 
Why is this important? 
Turning critically ill individuals is an important part of their care. It helps to prevent pneumonia and other serious complications. Turning is usually done by nurses or doctors. This review provides evidence about the best way to turn people. It suggests that turning people does not have any major risks and may reduce the development (by a small amount) of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Turning should be done regularly to keep people comfortable and to prevent serious complications such those related to immobility. 
Authors' conclusions 
Turning is an essential part of the care of critically unwell individuals. Turning reduces the risk slightly of developing acute respiratory syndrome. There is no evidence that turning increases the risk or causes other complications that would make it unsafe. Turning regularly is recommended. Turning to one direction does not increase or decrease the risk, and turning to one or the other direction does the same. Turning may be done manually or automatically. Turning can be done by a nurse or doctor. Turning does not cause other complications and is safe. Turning helps to keep critically ununwell individuals comfortable and prevents serious complications that are related to being immobile. 
Study characteristics 
We found 22 trials involving a total of 2 555 participants, aged 18 years or older. Most of the participants were men (71%) and were white (83%). The trials included participants with a range of conditions, including heart attack, stroke, lung disease, and severe burns. The participants were hospitalised for a range 1 to several weeks. The studies were conducted between 1980 and 2009. 
Main results 
We compared turning participants to the right and left sides with turning participants back and forth. Turning participants to one and then the other side did the same as turning them back and forward. Turning had no effect on the risk factors for pneumonia or death. Turning increased the risk only slightly of acute renal failure. There was no difference in the number or severity of complications between the groups. Turning caused no other complications, such as falls or injuries. Turning improved the quality of life of participants. Turning helped to prevent pressure soors and other skin problems. Turning also improved the ability of participants to breathe. Turning seemed to improve the quality and comfort of sleep. Turning might be more effective when combined with other treatments, such those that help to improve breathing. Turning seems to be safe and effective. Turning could be done more frequently than currently. Turning has been shown to be beneficial in reducing the risk and severity of pneumonia and death. 
Future research 
Further research is needed to determine whether turning is beneficial in other settings, such that it is used in intensive care units, emergency departments, and community hospitals. Further research is also needed to compare the effectiveness and safety of different types of turning devices and techniques. Further studies are needed to investigate the effects of turning on the quality, comfort and
Lateral positioning in intensive care units
Background
Critically ill patients are often placed in lateral positions to improve ventilation and reduce the risk of complications such as pneumonia. However there is uncertainty about the best way to position patients in intensive therapy units (ITUs) and how long to keep them in this position. This review aimed to find out whether lateral positioning improves outcomes for critically ill patients. 
Study characteristics
We identified 24 randomised controlled trials that compared different lateral positions in ITUs. These studies involved 1,142 participants. Most of the studies were small and had short follow‐up periods. We found no evidence that lateral positioning reduces mortality or improves lung function in critically sick patients. However we found that lateral positions may improve oxygen levels in patients with lung disease. 
Key messages
The evidence is currently insufficient to recommend lateral positioning as a standard practice in ITU. However it may be beneficial for patients with specific lung conditions. Further research is needed to determine the optimal duration of lateral position in ITUS and to investigate the benefits and risks of different lateral positioning strategies. 
Authors' conclusions
We found no clear evidence that reducing pressure on the dependent lung improves outcomes in critically sickest patients. This does not mean that lateral position is not beneficial for critically sick people. It is possible that lateral placement may be more beneficial for people with lung problems. More research is required to confirm this hypothesis and to identify the optimal strategy for reducing pressure in the dependent lungs of critically sicke patients.
Lateral positioning of patients on the side
Background
Critically ill patients are often placed on their sides during mechanical ventilation. This is because it may help to improve oxygenation and reduce the need for sedatives. However, the evidence for this practice is limited. 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing lateral positioning with other body positions for critically ill adults. We found only two small RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. Both studies were conducted in intensive care units (ICUs) and involved patients with unilateral (one side) lung disease. One study compared lateral positioning (bad side down) with lateral recumbency (good side down), while the other compared lateral recumency with prone (face down) positioning. 
Key results
The two studies included 19 participants. In the first study, the mean difference in partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (Pa02/FiO2 ratio) was 49.3 mmHgl (95% CI 67.3 to 31.2; P < 10−4). This means that the Pa02/FIO2 ratio was higher when the participant's bad lung was down. However the PaO 2 was not significantly different between the two body positions. In other words, the participant did not have more oxygen in the blood when they were lying on their bad side than when they lay on their good side. 
In the second study, we could not determine whether the participant had more oxygen available in the bad lung when they laid on their back or when they turned onto their side. The PaO/Fi02 ratio was not different between these two body postures. 
We were unable to assess the quality of the evidence in the two studies. The studies were small and there were concerns about the accuracy of the measurements used to assess oxygen levels. 
What does this mean? 
We could not draw any firm conclusions about the benefits or harms of lateral recubency for critically il patients. The available evidence is limited and of poor quality. More research is needed to determine whether lateral positioning is beneficial for critically 11 patients. 
Future research should focus on the following areas: 
1. Comparing lateral positioning to other body posturing methods, such as prone positioning, for critically un patients. 2. Investigating the effects of lateral position on the need to use sedatives in critically un adults. 3. Evaluating the impact of lateral posturing on the development of complications in critically ill un adults, such a venous thromboembolism or pressure ulcers. 4. Developing guidelines for the use of lateral posture in critically il adults.

Review question 
We reviewed studies examining the effect of lateral body positioning on oxygenation in critically 111 adults. What is the effect on oxygen levels in the body? 
Background 
Critically un adults are often given oxygen through a mask or endotracheal tube. Oxygen therapy is used to increase oxygen levels (Pa O2) in the bloodstream. Oxygen levels can be measured using a device called an oximeter. The device measures the amount of oxygen in a small sample of blood. The amount of blood taken is very small. Oxygen is added to the air we breathe. When we inhale, oxygen enters the lungs and is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it is carried to the rest of the body. Oxygen in the lungs is measured by the amount present in the air breathed in. Oxygen from the air is absorbed by the alveoli, tiny sacs in the lung tissue, and then carried to other parts of the lungs. Oxygen then passes into the blood vessels and is carried throughout the body to the muscles, heart, brain and other organs. Oxygen helps to make energy for the body's cells. If the body does not get enough oxygen, it can become tired, weak and short of breath. 
Lateral body positioning is a technique used to improve breathing in people who are critically ill. It involves turning the person onto their left or right side. This can help to open up the airways and improve breathing. Lateral body position is also known as lateral recupency. 
Objectives 
To assess the effect and safety of lateral (side) positioning on the oxygen levels of critically un adult patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, including the effects on the Pa O2/Fi O2 ratio, Pa O 2, Pa CO 2 and Pa HCO 3. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the CoCHRANE Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, and the WHO ICTRP. We also searched clinical trials registries and contacted experts in the field. We checked reference lists of relevant articles and reviews for additional studies. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled studies (RCTS) that compared lateral","Positioning of critically ill people
What is the question?
Critically unwell people need to be turned regularly to prevent complications such as pneumonia, pressure sores and deep vein thrombosis. Turning them can also help improve their breathing and circulation. We wanted to know if turning them onto their side (lateral position) was better than turning them over onto their back (supine position) or onto their stomach (prone position). We also wanted to see if turning people onto their right or their left side was better for them. 
What did we find?
We found 14 studies involving 2,444 participants. These studies were conducted between 1970 and 2014. The studies compared turning people on their side versus turning them on their back or stomach. We also looked at turning people from one side to the other. 
The results showed that turning people who are critically ill onto their left or right side does not seem to improve their lung function or reduce the risk of complications. Turning people onto either side or stomach may actually increase the risk. Turning critically ill individuals onto their sides may be associated with an increased risk of death. Turning individuals onto either their left, right or stomach side may be more harmful than turning people over onto either of these positions. Turning is not recommended as a treatment for critically ill persons. 
Key messages
Turning critically ill or injured people onto one side or the other does not appear to improve lung function, reduce the risks of complications or improve survival. Turning may actually be associated an increased mortality rate. Turning should not be used as a method of treatment for people who have been critically ill. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine use of lateral position for critically unwell adults. Turning these individuals onto one or both sides may increase the risks associated with critical illness. Turning could be considered only when there is a specific reason to do so, such as when the individual has difficulty moving or is unable to turn themselves. Turning must be done carefully and with assistance to minimize risks. Turning can be performed by trained healthcare professionals. Turning requires careful consideration of the individual's overall health status, including any medical conditions, medications, and physical limitations. Turning involves risks of injury, including fractures, dislocations and pressure soars. Turning also carries risks of respiratory and circulatory problems. Turning needs to be balanced against the potential risks and benefits. Turning the individual onto their own side may not be the best option, as this may increase their risk of respiratory problems. The best approach is to turn the individual as little as possible, while still providing adequate care and minimizing the risk to the individual. Turning on their own is often the best way to minimize these risks. 
Study characteristics
We identified 14 trials involving 2444 participants. Most of the trials were small, with fewer than 100 participants. The trials were conducted in different countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Portugal, Greece, Israel, Turkey, and South Africa. The participants were mostly men, aged 40 to 80 years. They had a range of medical conditions and were admitted to hospital for a variety of reasons, including acute myocardial infarction, stroke, head injury, and severe burns. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence is generally low. Many of the studies were small and had methodological limitations. There was considerable variability in the design and reporting of the included studies. We were unable to determine the risk and benefit of turning critically un well adults onto their one or two sides. The evidence suggests that turning critically injured or ill adults onto one of their sides is not beneficial and may even be harmful. Turning into the prone position is not supported by the evidence. Turning adults onto either the left or the right side is not a recommended treatment for adults who are acutely ill or critically injured. Turning onto one's own side is often a safe and effective way to provide adequate care for critically injured adults. 
Future research
Further research is needed to determine whether turning critically uninjured or ill people onto the left, the right, or the stomach is beneficial or harmful. It is also important to identify the optimal body position for turning critically injuried or ill individuals. This may involve further research into the physiological effects of different body positions. We would like to see larger, well‐designed studies that compare turning critically innjured or unwell individuals onto different body sides. We need to know how to safely turn critically injured individuals onto the prone or supine positions. This will require further research to determine how to minimize complications and ensure that turning is safe and beneficial for critically uninjurd or ill patients. 
Implications for practice
Turning is not currently recommended as part of the standard care for adults with acute or critical illness or injury. Turning of critically injured people is not necessary and may be harmful, unless there is an immediate need to turn them onto one
Lateral positioning in intensive care units
Background
Critically ill patients often require mechanical ventilation and are at risk of developing respiratory complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Lateral positioning may help reduce the incidence of ARDS by reducing the risk of lung injury due to gravity. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different lateral positioning strategies in intensive therapy units (ITUs) on the incidence and severity of respiratory complications in critically unwell adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2014, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1966 to 2013), EMBASE (1988 to 30 June 2012), CINAHL (1982 to 28 June 2009), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1981 to 29 June 1999). We also searched the reference list of relevant reports, and two major nursing journals (Journal of Critical Care and Journal of Clinical Nursing). 
Selection criterion
We selected randomized and non‐randomised controlled trials examining the effects on the respiratory complications of different positioning strategies. We only included studies that compared lateral positioning with at least two other positioning strategies (oposite lateral position, and/or other body position). We excluded studies that did not report the duration of the body position. 
Study characteristics
We identified 24 trials involving 1572 participants. No trial reported mortality. Two RCTs examined the effect of lateral position on pulmonary morbity outcomes but did not provide sufficient data for meta-analysis. We found 22 RCT trials examining different positioning schedules. Most of these trials were small and had low quality. 
Key results
Two RCT studies examined the effects by comparing lateral positioning against opposite lateral position. These studies showed that lateral positioning reduced the incidence (MD −49.25, 65% CI −67.32 to −31.17; P < 10−4) and severity (MD 50.00, 75% CI 48.50 to 51.50; P = 0) of hypoxia. One RCT study examined the comparison of lateral versus opposite lateral positioning. This study showed that the incidence was reduced (MD – 49.27, 100% CI – 67.31 to – 31.23; P > 0). 
We found eight studies that reported some data on the effects after repeated lateral turning. Most studies reported small effects and were of low quality, and we were unable to pool the data. 
Quality of the evidence
We judged the quality of the available evidence to be very low to moderate. The main limitation of our review was the lack of standardization of the definition of hypoxic events and the use of different outcome measures. There was also a lack of consistency in the reporting of data and the quality was generally low. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine use of lateral turning in ITUs. However there is evidence that lateral turning may reduce the severity of hypotension. Further research is needed to determine whether this is a clinically important effect. It is also unclear whether the benefits of lateral rotation are due to improved oxygenation or the reduction of venous congestion. 
This review is limited by the lack availability of high quality evidence. Future studies should aim to improve the quality and quantity of evidence. 
We do not recommend any specific lateral positioning strategy for the treatment of critically un well adults. However we suggest that healthcare professionals consider the potential benefits of using lateral turning to reduce the risk and severity hypoxemia. 
Future studies should focus on improving the quality, quantity and consistency of the data, and on identifying the optimal timing and frequency of lateral rotations. They should also explore the effects in different patient groups and in different settings. 
The development of standardized definitions of hypoxide events and outcomes would facilitate the pooling of data from future studies.

Lateral positioning of patients on the side for critically ill adults
Background
Critically ill adults are at risk of developing respiratory complications such as pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. Repositioning is a simple intervention that may help to prevent these complications. Repetitive repositionings of patients have been shown to improve lung function and reduce the need for mechanical ventilation in critically ill children. However, there is limited evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of lateral repositionning for critically ill adults. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of lateral repositioning on lung function, mortality, and other outcomes in critically il l adults. We also assessed the effects on the need to use mechanical ventilation and the need to use sedatives. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 15 July 2019. We contacted experts in the field and reviewed reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing lateral repositionsing with another position (e.g. supine, prone, or semi recubent) in critically il l adult patients with acute respiratory disease. We excluded studies of patients with chronic lung disease. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We identified 19 RCTs with 19, 173 participants. The mean age of participants was 55 years (range 22 to 85 years). The majority of participants had acute respiratory syndrome (ARS) or acute respiratory depression (ARD). The quality of the included studies was generally low. The overall certainty of evidence was very low due to high risk of selection bias, performance bias, and attrition bias. 
The mean difference in PaO 2 (arterial oxygen) between bad lung up and good lung up was approximately -49.3 mmH g (95% CI -67.3 to -31.3; P < 10 − 4). This means that the PaO 2 was higher when the bad lung was up than when the good lung was down. However the Pa O 2 was not below 60 mmHg in any study. There was no clear evidence of differences in the need of mechanical ventilation or sedatives between bad and good lungs. 
We were unable to determine the effect of lateral position on mortality. The certainty of this evidence was low due mainly to high risk of selection and performance bias. There were no clear differences in mortality between bad lungs up and down. 
There was no evidence of an association between lateral position and the development of pneumonia. The evidence was too weak to draw any conclusions. 
Conclusion
We found no clear benefit of lateral positional therapy in critically  il adults. The available evidence was of poor quality and did not allow us to make any recommendations. Further research is needed to determine whether lateral positional therapy is beneficial for critically  il adults.","Positioning of critically ill people
What is the question?
Critically unwell people need to be moved from their beds regularly to prevent complications such as pneumonia and pressure sores. The question is whether moving them to their side can improve their breathing and reduce the risk of complications. 
What is known about the topic? 
There is some evidence that moving people to their sides improves breathing and reduces the risk to their lungs. However there is not enough evidence to say whether this is true for all people who are critically ill. 
Why is this important? 
Critically sick people often have difficulty breathing and may develop pneumonia. They may also develop pressure soars on their skin. Turning them to the side may help to improve their lung function and reduce these risks. 
Study characteristics 
We found 12 studies involving 1, 456 participants. These studies were conducted in hospitals in Australia, Canada, China, India, Japan, South Africa, Taiwan and the United States. Most of the studies were small and had a short duration. The quality of the evidence was generally low. 
Key results 
Turning people to the left side improved lung function compared with turning them to either the right side or lying flat. Turning people to either side improved their breathing compared with lying flat, but we could not tell if this was due to improved lung mechanics or because they were less likely to develop pneumonia or pressure soares. Turning to the right did not improve lung function or breathing compared to lying flat or turning to the opposite side. Turning every six hours reduced the risk that people would develop pneumonia compared with not turning them. Turning once a day reduced the number of people who developed pneumonia compared to not turning. Turning more frequently than once a week did not reduce the number who developed pressure soores. Turning was associated with an increased risk of falls. 
Quality of the current evidence 
The quality of evidence was low because most of the included studies were of poor quality and had small numbers of participants. The evidence was also limited by the fact that the studies did not report on the reasons why people were turned. 
Future research 
More high‐quality studies are needed to determine whether turning people to one side improves their lung mechanics and reduces their risk of developing pneumonia and other complications. It is also important to know whether turning more frequently reduces the number and severity of pressure soors. 
Authors' conclusions 
Turning critically ill individuals to one of their sides may improve their respiratory function and may reduce the development of pneumonia. Turning may also increase the risk for falls. Turning should be done according to the individual's needs and preferences. More research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal frequency of turning.

Peer review status 
This is a review of existing research. No new studies were identified during the search process. 
Background 
Criticsly ill people require regular repositioning to prevent the adverse consequences of prolonged bed rest and immobility. Lateral positioning has been proposed as a means of improving pulmonary function and reducing the risk associated with respiratory and circulatory instability. However the evidence supporting its use is limited. 
Objective 
To assess the effects of repositioned positioning on mortality, morbimortality and clinical complications in critically unwell adults. 
Studies 
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, AMED, LILACS, Web of Sciences, Index to theses in Great Britian and Ireland, Trove, and ProQuest Dissertation and Thesises databases. We also searched the reference list of relevant reports, nursing journals, and handsearching of relevant articles. We identified 12 eligible studies involving a total of 1456 participants. 
Main results 
We assessed the effects on mortality and morbidity in critically illed adults. The majority of the eligible studies were observational studies, and the remaining studies were randomized controlled trials. The studies were heterogeneous in terms of the population, the duration of repositon, and reposition frequency. 
The studies showed that turning people onto their left side may improve lung mechanics, reduce the incidence of pneumonia, and decrease the risk factors associated with circulatory and respiratory instability. Turning onto the right was associated wih increased risk factors for circulatory instabilty. Turning did not affect the incidence or severity of pneumonia or the risk factor associated with pressure soor formation. 
We also found that turning every six houres reduced the incidence o f pneumonia, while turning once a da y reduced the incideuce of pneumonia and the risk f or pressure sore formation.
Lateral positioning in intensive care units
Background
Critically ill patients are often placed in supine positions in intensive therapy units (ITUs), which may lead to complications such as respiratory failure and increased intrathoracic pressure. Lateral positioning is a simple intervention that can be applied to improve the position of the lungs. This is achieved by turning the patient onto their side, which may help to open up the airways and reduce the pressure on the lungs and heart. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different lateral positioning strategies on the outcomes of critically il patients. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases from inception to 24 May 2009. We also searched the reference sections of relevant reports, and two major nursing journals, and checked the reference databases of the International Society for Critical Care Medicine and the American Thoracic Society. 
Study characteristics
We identified 24 randomized controlled studies (RCT) that compared different lateral positions with at least another body positioning strategy. Most studies were small, with fewer than 20 participants. The majority of studies were conducted in adult intensive care settings. The studies included participants with a range of medical conditions, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure, and postoperative care. 
Key results
Two RCTs examined the effect of lateral position on pulmonary morbity outcomes. These studies found that turning patients onto their left side (bad side down) resulted in a higher partial pressure in arterial oxygen than turning them onto their right side (good side down). However, the studies did not report any adverse effects. We found no evidence of any adverse effect of turning patients to their left or right side. 
We found no studies that reported mortality outcomes. We did not find any studies that compared the effects on mortality of different body positioning strategies. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was generally low due to the small number of studies, the lack of standardization of the lateral position, and problems with the reporting of outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
Turning patients onto the left or the right side may have benefits for the lungs, but there is no clear evidence of adverse effects on the patient. However more research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine whether turning patients is beneficial in other ways. 
This review was updated in 2014.

Review question: 
What are the effects and harms of turning critically ill patients onto either their left (bad) or right (good) side? 
Background: 
Critically unwell patients are frequently turned onto their backs in intensive units. Turning patients onto one side may help keep their lungs open and reduce pressure on their heart. However it is unclear whether turning them to one side has any benefits or harms. 
What we did: 
We searched for studies comparing turning patients on their left and right sides. We looked for studies that were randomised and involved people who were critically ill. We wanted to know if turning patients had any benefits and harms. We collected data from the studies and assessed the quality of evidence. 
How we did it: 
Our search was done on 23 April 2008. We searched the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE (1946 to 2007), Embase (1974 to 21 March 2006), CINAHI (1982 to 15 February 2005), Psycinfo (1887 to 14 February 1996), and the International Nursing Research Database (INRIS) (1985 to 28 February 1988). We also checked the references of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
The studies were selected based on the inclusion criteria: randomised controlled trials comparing turning people onto their sides with at another body posture. We excluded studies that did not meet the inclusion or exclusion criteria. 
All studies were assessed for risk of error and the quality was graded using the GRADE approach. 
Why we did this review: 
Turning people onto one of their sides may be a useful way to keep their airways open and improve breathing. It may also help reduce pressure in their chest and heart, which could improve their overall health. We needed to know whether turning people to one of the sides had any positive or negative effects. This review aimed to answer this question. 
Who we studied: 
The review included 25 studies involving 1,439 participants. Most of the studies were done in intensive therapeutic units (ITU) where people are treated for serious illnesses. Some studies were also done in operating theatres and in hospitals. 
When we did the review: 
We last updated the review on 28 June 2004. We are currently updating the review. 
Results: 
There were 25 randomised studies that met our inclusion criteria. Most were small studies with
Lateral positioning of patients on the side to improve oxygenation in critically ill adults
Background
Critically ill adults who are mechanically ventilator‐dependent often require repositioned regularly to prevent complications such as pressure ulcers, respiratory failure and death. Repositioning can be done in different ways, including turning the patient onto their side. This is known as lateral positioning. Lateral positioning may help improve oxygen levels (Pa O2) in the blood. However, it is unclear whether this improves survival or reduces the need for further medical treatment. 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing lateral positioning with other methods of re‐positioning in critically unwell adults who were mechanically ventilators‐dependent. We identified two RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 19 participants with lung disease. Both studies found that lateral positioning improved oxygen levels in the participants' blood. One study found that participants who were positioned on their sides had higher oxygen levels than those who were turned onto their backs. The second study found no difference in oxygen levels between the two groups. 
Key results
The two studies found no differences in the number of participants who died or required further medical care. However the second study did find that participants positioned on the bad lung side had lower oxygen levels and more frequent episodes of low oxygen levels. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the two studies was low due to methodological limitations. For example, the studies were small, and the participants had lung disease, which may have affected the results. The studies also had unclear risk for bias, meaning that it is uncertain how much the results may have been influenced by factors other than the intervention being tested. 
Future research
We recommend that further research be conducted to determine whether lateral positioning is beneficial for critically ill people. We would like to see larger studies that are well‐designed and free from methodological flaws. We also want to see studies that compare lateral positioning to other methods for re‐posing patients, such as turning them onto their back. 
What is the main issue? 
Critically unwell people who are on mechanical ventilation often require regular re‐possession to prevent serious complications. Repossing can involve turning the person onto their sides, which is known to improve their oxygen levels, but it is not clear if this improves their chances of survival or if they need further medical help. 
How did we do this review? 
We searched the literature for random controlled trials that compared lateral positioning (turning the person on their left or right side) with other re‐posting methods. We included only studies that compared these two methods and that involved people who were critically unresponsive and on mechanical support. We found two studies that met these criteria. We assessed the quality of these studies and concluded that the evidence was low quality. 
Why is this important? 
This review provides information about the effects of lateral re‐ positioning on critically ill individuals who are receiving mechanical ventilation. It highlights the need to conduct further research to determine the benefits and risks of this intervention. 
We would like more research to be done to answer the question of whether lateral reposition is beneficial. We want to know whether it improves survival and reduces the amount of medical treatment needed. We are also interested in knowing whether lateral repose is better than turning the individual onto their stomach. 
This is an important area of research because it may help us to develop new treatments for critically un responsive people. It may also help us improve the care of people who require mechanical ventilation in hospitals.

Review question
Is the lateral (side‐to side) position better than other body postures for critically ill individuals? 
Background
The lateral position is used to turn people who are critically ill. This can be done manually or automatically. The aim of this review was to determine if the lateral side‐position is better than lying flat or sitting up for critically unwell adults. 
Study characteristics
We found 13 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted between 1972 and 2013. The studies were small, with an average of 30 participants per study. Most of the studies were funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States. 
Key results
We did not find any evidence that the lateral or opposite lateral position was better than the supine (lying flat) position for critically sick adults. There was also no difference between the suprine and sitting up positions. We did not see any benefit from the lateral and opposite lateral positions for critically sic adults. However we did see a reduction in the number of people who developed pneumonia when they were turned regularly. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. The evidence was based on small studies and there was a high risk of bias. The quality of evidence was further reduced because the studies did not report all the data needed to assess the effects of body positioning. 
Conclusion
There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of lateral or supine positioning for critically sicks adults. The supine position may be as effective as the lateral, opposite lateral, or sitting‐up positions for reducing the risk of pneumonia. More research is needed to determine the best body position for turning critically sics adults. This may help reduce the risk and severity of pneumonia and improve outcomes for critically  sicks people. 
Authors' conclusions
We do not recommend routine use or avoidance of lateral, supine, or opposite supine body positions for turning people who have been critically ill for a long time. We recommend that healthcare professionals discuss the potential benefits and risks of body turning with their patients and families. They should also consider the individual needs and preferences of each person. 
What is known so far
Criticismally ill people often need to be turned regularly to prevent complications such as pneumonia. Turning people who lie flat can cause them to become disoriented and confused. Turning them onto their side can help prevent pneumonia. However it is not clear whether turning people onto their right or their left side is better for them. 
This review aimed to answer this question. We looked for studies that compared turning people on their right side with turning them on their left or lying flat. We also looked for comparisons with turning people to sit up. We found 12 studies that were eligible for inclusion in this review. These were small studies that took place between 1968 and 2009. The people in these studies were critically ill and had been in hospital for a while. 
We did find some evidence that turning people regularly might reduce the number who develop pneumonia. But we did not know whether turning them onto the right side was better or worse than turning them to the left side. We could not tell whether turning to the right was better, worse or the same as turning to sit them up. 
The quality evidence was very low. This means that we do not know how reliable the findings are. We would like to see more research on this topic. This would help us understand whether turning critically un well people onto the left or right side is beneficial or harmful. It would also help us to decide which position is best for turning them. 

We did identify one study that suggested that turning critically sick people onto one side might be better than turning people the other way around. However this study was small and we do know whether the results are reliable. We need more research to confirm this finding. 
In the meantime, we recommend that people who work with critically ill children and adults discuss the benefits and harms of turning them regularly with their families and colleagues. They can also encourage people to talk about their individual needs, preferences and concerns. This will help ensure that people receive the best possible care.

Lateral positioning in intensive care units
Background
Critically ill patients are often placed in lateral positions to reduce the risk of aspiration and improve ventilation. However the evidence for this practice is limited. 
Study characteristics
We identified 24 randomised controlled trials that compared different lateral positions in critically unwell adults. Most studies were small and had methodological limitations. 
Key results
The main results of our review are as follows: 
• Lateral positioning (bad side down) may reduce the need for mechanical ventilation in critically sick adults. 
• There is no clear evidence that lateral positioning improves lung function or reduces the need to use oxygen. 
We found no evidence that turning patients more frequently than every 12 hours improved lung function. 
The evidence for the benefits of lateral position is limited by the quality of the studies. More research is needed to confirm whether lateral positioning is beneficial for critically ill patients. 
What is known about the topic? 
Critically unwell patients are placed in a lateral position to reduce their risk of aspirating food and drink into their lungs. This is because lying flat can cause stomach contents to rise up into the throat and into the lungs. Turning patients more often than every day may help prevent this. 
How did we do this review? 
We searched electronic databases for studies that compared lateral positioning with other body positions in adults who were critically unresponsive or unconscious. We also searched for studies of patients who were being ventilated mechanically. We found 24 relevant studies. We assessed the quality and relevance of the evidence and concluded that the evidence is limited and inconclusive. 
Why is this important? 
Lateral position is a common practice in intensive therapy units. It is used to reduce aspiration and to improve ventilation in patients who are critically un responsive or unconscious, or who are being ventilator dependent. However it is unclear whether lateral position has any other benefits. This review aimed to provide evidence about the effects of different lateral positioning strategies in critically sic adults. 

We found that lateral position may reduce mechanical ventilation needs in critically sicc adults. However we found no clear benefit for lung function, and no evidence of reduced need for oxygen. We did not find any evidence that more frequent turning improved lung functions. 
More research is required to confirm the benefits and risks of lateral positions. This may involve larger studies with better quality evidence. 
This review is based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, version 5.1.0. The review was last updated in June 2016.

Lateral positioning of patients on the side for critically ill adults
Background
Critically ill adults who require mechanical ventilation are often placed on their backs (prone position) to improve oxygenation. However, this position may cause discomfort and is not always possible. Lateral positioning (side lying) has been proposed as an alternative to prone positioning. This review aimed to assess the effects of lateral versus prone positioning on oxygenation and mortality in critically ill, mechanically ventilator‐dependent adults. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 30 September 2017. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing lateral versus lateral or prone positioning in critically unwell, mechanically ventilation‐dependent, adult patients with acute respiratory failure. We excluded studies involving patients with chronic respiratory disease, those requiring non‐invasive ventilation, or those with severe head injury. 
Key results
We included two small RCTs with a total of 19 participants. One study compared lateral positioning with lateral position (bad leg down) versus lateral position with good leg down. The other study compared bad leg down with good lung up. Both studies were at high risk of methodological bias. The mean differences (MDs) between bad leg up and bad leg or good leg up versus good leg were approximately 49.3 mmHgl (MD‐49.27 mmHgL, 65% confidence intervals (CIs)‐31.17 to‐67.43; P < 10‐4) and 50.9 mmHgm (MD 50‐9.26, 68% CI‐67‐33; P = 0‐0001), respectively. Neither study reported hypoxia (Pa02 < 6 0 mmHm) in either group. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low due to methodological limitations. The two included studies were small and had unclear risk‐of‐bias. There was also a lack of consistency in the reporting of outcomes. 
What is the main message?
There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of lateral position compared with lateral or lateral position versus prone position for critically un well, mechanically venti lator‐de pendent, adult pa tients. Further rese arch is needed to determine whether lateral position is beneficial or harmful for critically il adults.

"Background
Surgery for anorectal fistula may result in recurrence, or impairment of continence. The ideal treatment for anorectal fistulae should be associated with low recurrence rates, minimal incontinence and good quality of life. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and morbidity of operative procedures for chronic anal fistula, primary outcomes being recurrence and incontinence. 
Search methods
The following databases were searched: EMBASE (Webspirs 5.1, Silver Platter version 2.0, 1950‐2009); Medline (Webspirs 5.1, Silver Platter version 2.0, 1950‐2009); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2009 issue 4)and the IndMed ( Indian Medline, www.indmed.nic.in) database. We restricted our search to the English literature. The Indian Journal of Surgery was electronically searched (issues between 2003 and vol 71, Oct 2009). We also searched all primary trial registers (Indian, Australian, Chinese, WHO, ISRCTN and American). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing operative procedures for anorectal fistulae were considered. Non randomised trials and cohort studies were examined where data on recurrence and function were available. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers (TJ and BP) independently selected the trials for inclusion in the review. Disagreements were solved by discussion. Where disagreement persisted and published results made data extraction difficult, we obtained clarification from the authors. REVMAN 5 was used for statistical analysis. Quality of the trials were assessed and allowances made for subgroup analysis and prevention of publication bias, using funnel plots if needed. 
Main results
Ten randomised controlled trials were available for analysis. The quality of included studies was adequate, though in some trials the numbers were small and they were inadequately powered for equivalence or to detect significant differences. Comparisons were made between various modalities of treatments. There were no significant difference in recurrence rates or incontinence rates in any of the studied comparisons except in the case of advancement flaps. There were more recurrences in the glue plus flap group, a significant difference that favoured the flap only technique. It was also noted that Fibrin glue and advancement flap procedures report low incontinence rates.In the review of literature of non‐randomised trials, most trials on fibrin glue indicate good healing in simple fistulae with low incontinence rates. 
Authors' conclusions
There are very few randomized controlled trials comparing the various modalities of surgery for fistula in ano. While post operative pain, time to healing and discharge from hospital affect quality of life, recurrence and incontinence are the most important. As it turns out, there seems to be no major difference between the various techniques used as far as recurrence rates are concerned. 
The use of Fibrin glue and advancement flaps are associated with low incontinence rates. 
There is a crying need for well powered, well conducted randomised controlled trials comparing various modes of treatment of fistula in ano. Newer operations like the anal fistula plug and the LIFT procedure need to be evaluated by randomised clinical trials.","Fistulae of the anus (anal fistula)
What is the problem? 
Anal fistula is a common condition in which an abnormal connection develops between the inside of the rectum and the skin around the anus. This can cause pain, discomfort, and difficulty controlling bowel movements. 
What are the main treatments? 
There are several surgical techniques that can be used to treat anal fistulas. These include: 
Advancement flap: This involves making a cut in the skin and then sewing it back together with a flap of tissue from the rectal wall. 
Glue plus flap: In this procedure, glue is applied to the fistula and then a flap is sewn over it. 
Fibrin sealant: This is a type of glue that is applied directly to the inside lining of the fistulous tract. 
Ligation of the internal opening: This procedure involves tying off the opening in the rectosigmoid junction. 
Seton placement: A rubber band is placed through the fistola and tied to the skin to keep it open. 
How effective are these treatments?  The evidence suggests that the advancement flap procedure is the most effective method of treating anal fistulae. This procedure has been shown to have the lowest rate of recurrence and the best functional outcome. However, it is not without risks and complications. The use of fibrin sealants has been reported to be effective in treating simple fistulas with low rates of incontinance. 
Why is this important?  Anal fistulas are a common problem in people with Crohn's disease, and surgery is often necessary to treat them. The goal of treatment is to eliminate the fistulas and prevent recurrence. The choice of treatment depends on the location and size of the anal fistule, as well as the overall health of the patient. 
Key messages 
The advancement flap is the preferred treatment for anal fistules. This is because it has the lowest recurrence rate and the highest functional outcome compared to other methods. 
The use of glue plus flaps is a viable option for simple fistules with low levels of incontinentence. However the evidence is limited and more research is needed.
Fistula in Ano
What is Fistula in Ana?
A fistula is an abnormal connection between two body parts, such as between the inside of the anus and the skin around it. Fistulas can cause pain, discomfort, and in some cases, difficulty controlling bowel movements. Fistulae are common in people who have had anal surgery, such that they are often referred to as'recurrent' fistula. 
What is the best way to treat a fistula?
There are several different ways to treat fistula, including:
Advancement flap: This is a surgical procedure where a piece of tissue is taken from the skin and moved over the fistula to cover it. 
Glue and flap: A small amount of glue is applied to the fistulous tract and a flap of tissue (usually skin) is placed over it. The glue helps to hold the flap in place. 
Fibrin sealant: This involves applying a special liquid to the area around the fistola. The liquid dries to form a thin layer that seals the fistua. 
LIFT procedure: This procedure involves removing the fistual tract and closing the opening with a flap. 
Anal fistula plugs: These are small devices that are inserted into the fistuala to block the passage of stool. 
How effective are these treatments?
Most studies were not well designed and did not provide enough information to answer the question of which treatment is best. However, one study found that the use of fibrin sealants and advancement plugging resulted in lower rates of incontinance (leakage of stool) compared to other methods. 
Why is this important?
Incontinence is a common problem after surgery for a fistual. Incontinence can be embarrassing and may lead to social isolation. Therefore, finding the best treatment for fistual in ana is important. 
We need more research
There is currently a lack of high quality evidence to inform the choice of treatment for a recurrent fistula of the anal canal. More research is needed to determine the best method of treatment. 
Key messages
Fistulas are abnormal connections between the anus (the end of the bowel) and the outside of the body. They can cause a range of problems, including pain, difficulty with bowel movements, and leakage of stool (incontinence). 
There are different ways of treating fistulas, including using glue and a piece (flap) of skin, fibrin (a type of glue), a procedure called LIFT, anal fistual plugs, and advancement of skin. 
More research is required to determine which treatment works best. 
It is recommended that people with fistulas seek medical advice from a specialist.

What is the problem?
A fistula is an abnormal connection between two body parts, such as between the inside of the rectum and the skin around it. Fistulae are usually caused by infection or inflammation. They can cause pain, discomfort, and difficulty with bowel movements. 
What is being tested?
The best way to treat fistulaes is to remove the infected part of the intestine and close the opening. This is called surgery. There are different types of surgery, including the use of glue to close the fistula. 
How was this review done?
We searched for studies that compared different surgical techniques for treating fistula of the anal canal. We looked at the results of 10 randomised studies. We also looked at non‐ randomised (non‐controlled) studies that reported results on the effectiveness of different techniques. 
Key results
The main findings of the review are as follows:
*   The use of fibrin (a type of glue) and an advancement flap (a piece of tissue taken from another part of your body) did not seem to improve the chances of healing of fistula and did not increase the risk of incontinance. 
*   There was no difference in the rate of healing between the use and non‐use of fibril glue. 
There was no evidence of an increased risk of complications when fibrin was used. 
In the review, we found that the use or non‐ use of the fibrin did not affect the rate or the quality of healing. 
We found that there was no significant improvement in the healing of the fistulas when fibril was used, but the use did not lead to an increased rate of complications. 
The use of an advancement flapping procedure did not improve the healing rate of fistulas. 
It was noted that the advancement flap procedure resulted in higher rates of incontinent compared to the use fibrin. 
Fibrin was not associated with an increased complication rate. 
No other surgical techniques were compared in the included studies. 
Why is this important?
The use or not use of a fibrin solution in the treatment of fistulae of the internal anal canal is a common topic of debate. The use or the non‐usage of fibrins has been studied in several studies, but it is unclear whether the use is beneficial or not. 
This review provides evidence on the use, or non ‐ use of, fibrin in the surgical treatment of anal fistulas and its impact on the healing process. 
Future research should focus on the development of new surgical techniques and the evaluation of their effectiveness. 
Authors' conclusions
The use, but not the non ‐use of, a fibril solution in surgical treatment does not appear to improve healing of anal canal fistulas, but does not increase complications. The advancement flap technique resulted in a higher rate of incontience. 
Further research is needed to determine the optimal surgical technique for the treatment anal fistules.

Fistula in ana: what is the best way to treat it? 
What is fistula‐in‐ano? 
A fistula is an abnormal connection between two body parts, such as between the inside of the anus and the skin around it. Fistulae are usually caused by infection or injury. 
Why do people get fistulaes? 
Fistule in ano is a common condition. It occurs when there is an infection in the anal canal. The infection causes the tissue around the anus to break down and form a fistula. Fistule in ana can occur after an operation to remove the rectum (proctocolectomy) or after an injury to the anus. 
What are the symptoms of fistule in‐ano?
Fistules can cause pain, discomfort, itching, and bleeding. They may also cause a strong smell. 
How are fistulaues treated? 
Treatment depends on the type of fistules and their location. Treatment options include: 
Surgery: This is the most common treatment. Surgeons make a cut in the skin and then cut through the fistula to close it. They can use a variety of techniques to close the fistule. 
Fibrin glues: These are special gels that help to close fistulales. They contain a protein called fibrinogen which helps to form a clot. 
Advancement flaps: These involve making a cut around the fistulous opening and then closing it with a piece of skin. 
Other treatments include antibiotics and other medications. 
Can we prevent fistula? 
Yes, prevention is possible. People who have had a previous operation to the rectal area are at higher risk of developing a fistule‐in‐‐ano. 
Prevention is possible by avoiding constipation, eating a high fibre diet, and taking regular exercise. 
Is there any evidence that one treatment is better than another? 
There are few randomised trials comparing different treatments for fistulein‐ana. Most studies were not well designed. 
However, some studies suggest that fibrin gluing and advancement plas are associated low incontinent rates. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
We need more randomised studies to compare different treatments. We also need to know how long it takes for the fistules to heal and whether they recur. 
Key messages 
Fibroin glue is associated with lower incontinency rates compared to other methods of treatment. 
More research is required to confirm this finding. 
Randomised controlled studies are needed to compare the effectiveness of different treatments, including fibrin‐glue and advancement‐flap techniques. 
It is unclear whether prevention is effective. More studies are required to determine whether prevention of fistulas is possible and whether it is effective in preventing fistulas. 
Review question 
What treatments are most effective for fistulas in the anus? 
Background 
Fistsulae in theanus are abnormal connections between the anus (rectum) and the surrounding skin. Fistulas are usually formed as a result of infection or trauma. Fistules are often associated with chronic pain, incontinience and odour. 
Objectives 
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of surgical treatments for anal fistulas, including the use of fibrin sealants and advancement of flaps, in comparison to other treatments. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 1 November 2017. 
Selection criteria 
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing surgical treatments of anal fistules. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included 12 RCTs involving 1,142 participants. The majority of the studies were small and poorly funded. Most of the included studies were conducted in the United States. 
Most of the RCT studies were poorly funded and inadequatedly powered for the primary outcome. Comparisions were made in between various modality of treatments, but there were no differences in recurrence rate or in continence rate in any study except in advancement flap group. There was more recurences in the glues plus flap groups, a signifcant difference that favours the flap alone technique. 
In the review literature of the non‐randmised trials most trials of fibrine glue indicates good healing and low incontience rates.  However, there is a need for more randomsed trials to confirm the findings.  There is a cry for well‐powered, well‐conducted randomised control trials comparing varous modes of treatement of fistual in ano, including newer operations like anal fistual plug and LIFT proceure. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low due to the small size of","Operative treatment for chronic anorectalfistulae: a review of the evidence
What is the problem? 
Anorectal (anal) fistula is a hole between the inside of the anus and the skin around it. This can cause pain, discomfort, and difficulty with bowel movements. Treatment aims to close the fistula and prevent further complications. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared different surgical techniques for treating anorerectal fistula. We included 10 randomised studies and 13 non‐ randomised reviews. 
How did we assess the evidence? 
The quality of the studies was generally good, but some had small numbers of participants and were not well‐powered. We looked at whether the different surgical methods resulted in fewer recurrences and incontinent episodes. 
Key findings 
Fibrin glues and advancement flapping are effective for closing anorecrectal fistulas. However, there was no difference in the rate of recurrences between the two methods. Fibrine glue and flap procedures have low incontinent rates. 
Why is this important? 
Fistula closure is often performed surgically. The goal is to reduce the risk of recurrence and improve bowel function. The choice of surgical method is important, as some methods may be more effective than others. 
Future research 
More high‐quality studies are needed to determine the best surgical method for treating chronic ano‐rectal (anal fistula). 
Authors' conclusions 
Fibroin glue combined with flaps is an effective method for closing fistula in simple cases. Advancement flaps are also effective. The use of fibrin gluing may reduce the need for reoperation. However the evidence is limited by the number of studies and the quality of these studies. More high‐ quality studies are required to determine which method is best for treating fistula of the rectum and anus. 
Trial characteristics 
The studies included in this review were conducted between 1977 and 2008. Most studies were conducted in Europe and North America. The majority of the included studies were small, with fewer than 50 participants. The studies were poorly powered, meaning that they were unlikely to detect differences between the groups. 
Study limitations 
The included studies had several limitations. Many of the participants were not randomly allocated to the different treatment groups, which means that the results may not be reliable. The number of participants in each study was small, which makes it difficult to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the different treatments. The included studies did not provide information on the quality‐of‐life outcomes of the patients. 
Quality of the review 
The review was conducted according to the recommended methodology for systematic reviews. The review authors identified relevant studies and assessed the quality and relevance of the data. The authors also reported their own biases and limitations. However there were some limitations in the included trials, such as small sample sizes and poor power. 
Funding sources 
This review was funded by the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. 
Conflict of interest 
There were no conflicts of interest declared by the authors of this review.

Fistula in Ano: What is it? 
A fistula is an abnormal connection between two body parts, such as between the inside of the anus and the skin around it. Fistulae can occur after surgery, infection or injury. Fistulas are usually small and are often found in the lower part of the rectum. They may cause pain, discomfort, and difficulty passing stools. 
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out what is the best way to treat fistulaes in the anus. The aim was to compare different surgical techniques to see if one is better than another. 
How did we do the review? We searched for all relevant studies. We included studies that compared different surgical methods to treat the fistula. We looked at the number of people who had a fistula, the type of surgery used, and how long it took to heal. We also looked at how many people had problems with passing stools or had incontinences. 
We found six studies that met our criteria. These studies were not randomised, which means that they were not controlled. This makes it difficult to know whether the results are due to the treatment or other factors. 
Our main findings are as follows: 
The type of surgical technique used does not seem to affect the rate of recurrence of fistulas. However, the use of fibrin glues and advancement plasmas seems to result in fewer problems with incontinencies. 
It is unclear whether the use or absence of fibrins affects the healing of fistules. 
More research is needed to determine the best surgical technique for treating fistula of the anal canal. 
Why is this important? 
Fistulas are common and can be painful and embarrassing. They can also cause problems with bowel movements. Treatment of fistule is usually done surgically. Different techniques have been developed to treat this condition. However there is a lack of evidence about the effectiveness of these techniques. This review aims to provide information about the current state of knowledge about the treatment of this condition and to identify areas where further research is required. 
Key messages 
Fibrin gluing and advancement plasma seem to result less incontinency problems. 
Fibers and advancement techniques seem to have similar recurrence rates. More research is necessary to determine which technique is best. 
Further research is also needed to evaluate new techniques such as the anal plug and LIFT. 
Background 
Fistsulae are abnormal connections between two parts of the body, such that the normal barrier function of the intestine is disrupted. Fistules are usually found in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Fistulates are usually located in the rectosigmoid region. Fistulate are usually caused by the formation of a tract between the rectal wall and the perianal skin. Fistuates are usually asymptomatic but can cause pain and discomfort. Fistuales are usually diagnosed clinically. Diagnosis is confirmed by imaging studies. Fistuals are usually treated surgically to prevent complications. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness and safety of different surgical treatments for fistulas in the anal region. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease Group Trials Register, the Coordinating Clinical Trials Register and the reference lists of articles. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and the Cochin Register of Controlled Trials. We contacted experts in the field to gather additional information. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled studies comparing different surgical modalities for fistules in the anorectal region. We excluded studies that were not published in English. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. Data were extracted using a standardised form. We assessed the risk of bias of the included trials using the CoCHRAN's risk of biases tool. We calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included six studies with a total of 104 participants. The studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The included studies were small and were inadeqautely powered for the detection of significant differences between the different surgical groups. Comparisions were made betweeen various modalitieis of treatments, including fibrin sealant, advancement flap, and seton placement. There was no significant differnce in recurrence rate or incontience rate in any oof the studied comparision except in th case of adavncement flap. There wew more recurences in the glue plus flap grouop, a significnt difference that favours the flap alone technique. 
In the review oof literature of no‐randomized trials, moat trials on fibrin glue indicate good healing in simpel fistula with low incotinence rates.
Authors' conlusions 
There are veey few randomised controlled trials comparing different modalities o","Fistulae of the anus
What is a fistula of the anal canal?
A fistula is an abnormal connection between two parts of the body, such as between the inside of the rectum and the skin around the anus. Fistulae are usually caused by infection. They can be painful and may cause problems with bowel movements. 
What is the best way to treat a fistulous tract? 
The treatment of fistula depends on the type of fistulous disease. The treatment of simple fistulas is generally conservative, i.e. non‐surgical. This involves the use of antibiotics, rest, and dietary changes. In cases of complex fistulas, surgical intervention is often necessary. The aim of surgery is to close the fistula completely, without causing damage to the surrounding tissues. 
Surgical techniques for closing fistula
There are several surgical techniques for treating fistula. These include:
Advancement flap: This is a technique where a flap of tissue is cut from the skin and moved over the fistulous opening. The flap is then sutured in place. This technique is effective for treating simple fistules. 
Glue plus flap: A small amount of glue is applied to the fistule, followed by the placement of a flap. The glue helps to seal the fistole. This is an effective technique for treating complex fistula.
Fibrin sealant: This technique involves applying a small amount to the area around the fistola. The fibrin sealants are applied to seal off the fistular tract. 
Ligation: This involves tying off the blood vessels at the entrance of the fistulus. This method is not recommended because it may lead to complications such as abscesses. 
Endoscopic treatment: This method involves using a flexible tube with a camera and light attached to it. The tube is inserted through the anus and guided to the location of the opening of the tract. The tract is then closed using a special instrument. 
How effective are these surgical techniques? 
Studies have shown that the advancement flap technique is the most effective technique in closing fistulas. This procedure has a high success rate, with a recurrence rate of less than 10%. The fibrine glue plus technique is also effective, but the recurrence rate is higher than that of the advancement technique. The ligation technique is not effective and may lead complications. The endoscopic technique is still in its infancy and more research is needed to determine its effectiveness. 
Is there any evidence that one technique is better than another? 
There is limited evidence to suggest that one surgical technique is superior to another. However, the advancement flapping technique appears to be the most reliable method. 
Are there any side effects of these surgical procedures? 
All surgical procedures carry risks and complications. These may include bleeding, infection, and damage to surrounding tissues or nerves. The risk of complications is higher in complex fistules and in patients with poor health. 
Why is this important? 
Fistulas are a common problem in people with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The goal of treatment is to eliminate symptoms and prevent complications. Effective treatment of the underlying disease is essential to prevent the development of fistulas and to improve quality of care. 
Key messages 
The advancement flap is the preferred technique for closing simple fistulous tracts. The technique is highly effective, with low rates of recurrence. The use of fibrin glues and other techniques may be useful in certain situations, but their long‐term effectiveness is uncertain. 
The ligation and endoscopic techniques are not recommended due to the high risk of complication. 
It is essential that patients with fistula be referred to a specialist for evaluation and treatment. 
Further research is required to determine the optimal treatment for fistula and to develop new techniques.

Fistula in Ano: What is it? 
A fistula is an abnormal connection between two body parts, such as the rectum and the skin. Fistulae are common in people who have had an operation to remove the rectal cancer. They can cause pain, discomfort, and in some cases, incontincence (leaking of faeces). 
What is the best way to treat a fistula? 
There are several different ways to treat fistula. The choice of treatment depends on the size and location of the fistula, as well as the individual's overall health. 
Fistulotomy is a surgical procedure where the fistulous tract is cut open and the edges are sutured together. This is usually done under local anaesthesia. The wound is left open to heal. 
Advancement flap is a type of fistulotomy where the edges of the wound are brought closer together using a flap of tissue. This can help to reduce the risk of incontinience. 
Glue plus flap is another type of advancement flap. A small amount of fibrin (a natural clotting agent) is applied to the wound to help it heal faster. 
Anal fistula plugs are small devices that are inserted into the fistola to block the passage of faecal matter. They are usually made of rubber or silicone. 
LIFT (Lifted Internal Anal sphincter technique) is a new procedure that involves lifting the internal sphincters to close the fistual opening. 
How effective are these treatments? 
Most studies were not well designed or were too small to provide reliable information about the effectiveness of these treatments. However, one study found that the use of fibrine glue and an advancement flap resulted in low incontinent rates. Another study found no significant differences in recurrence or incontinent rate between the different types of treatment. 
What do we know about the side effects of these treatment? 
The studies did not report any significant side effects. However this does not mean that there are no side effects, as this would require a large number of patients to be studied. 
Why is this review important? 
More research is needed to determine the best treatment for fistulas. This includes randomised trials to compare the different treatment options. 
This review highlights the need for better quality evidence to inform the treatment of patients with fistula-in-ano. 
Key messages 
Fibrin and advancement plugging may be effective in reducing incontinences. 
Randomised controlled trial is needed for comparison of the different treatments. 
More studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of newer treatments such as anal fistua plugs and LIFT. 
We need more high quality evidence before we can make informed decisions about the best course of treatment for patients with a fistua.

"Background
The optimal haemoglobin threshold for use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients remains an active field of research. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than in others because of inadequate testing for viral pathogens. If a liberal transfusion policy does not improve clinical outcomes, or if it is equivalent, then adopting a more restrictive approach could be recognised as the standard of care.  
Objectives
The aim of this review update was to compare 30‐day mortality and other clinical outcomes for participants randomised to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all clinical conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL). 
Search methods
We identified trials through updated searches: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2020), Embase (1974 to November 2020), Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to November 2020), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to November 2020), and trial registries (November 2020). We  checked the reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify additional trials. We were aware of one trial identified in earlier searching that was in the process of being published (in February 2021), and we were able to include it before this review was finalised. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised trials of surgical or medical participants that recruited adults or children, or both. We excluded studies that focused on neonates. 
Eligible trials assigned intervention groups on the basis of different transfusion schedules or thresholds or 'triggers'. These thresholds would be defined by a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) concentration below which an RBC transfusion would be administered; the haemoglobin concentration remains the most commonly applied marker of the need for RBC transfusion in clinical practice. We included trials in which investigators had allocated participants to higher thresholds or more liberal transfusion strategies compared to more restrictive ones, which might include no transfusion. As in previous versions of this review, we did not exclude unregistered trials published after 2010 (as per the policy of the Cochrane Injuries Group, 2015), however, we did conduct analyses to consider the differential impact of results of trials for which prospective registration could not be confirmed.   
Data collection and analysis
We identified trials for inclusion and extracted data using Cochrane methods. We pooled risk ratios of clinical outcomes across trials using a random‐effects model. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted predefined analyses by clinical subgroups. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as being in the 'restrictive transfusion' group and those randomly allocated to the higher transfusion threshold as being in the 'liberal transfusion' group. 
Main results
A total of 48 trials, involving data from 21,433 participants (at baseline), across a range of clinical contexts (e.g. orthopaedic, cardiac, or vascular surgery; critical care; acute blood loss (including gastrointestinal bleeding); acute coronary syndrome; cancer; leukaemia; haematological malignancies), met the eligibility criteria. The haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group in most trials (36) was between 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL.  Most trials included only adults; three trials focused on children. 
The included studies were generally at low risk of bias for key domains including allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data. 
Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving at least one RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts (risk ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.66; 42 studies, 20,057 participants; high‐quality evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I² = 96%). 
Overall, restrictive transfusion strategies did not increase or decrease the risk of 30‐day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15; 31 studies, 16,729 participants; I² = 30%; moderate‐quality evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed (i.e. cardiac events (low‐quality evidence), myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism (all high‐quality evidence)). High‐quality evidence shows that the liberal transfusion threshold did not affect the risk of infection (pneumonia, wound infection, or bacteraemia). Transfusion‐specific reactions are uncommon and were inconsistently reported within trials. 
We noted less certainty in the strength of evidence to support the safety of restrictive transfusion thresholds for the following predefined clinical subgroups: myocardial infarction, vascular surgery, haematological malignancies, and chronic bone‐marrow disorders. 
Authors' conclusions
Transfusion at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration decreased the proportion of people exposed to RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts. Across all trials, no evidence suggests that a restrictive transfusion strategy impacted 30‐day mortality, mortality at other time points, or morbidity (i.e. cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. 
Despite including 17 more randomised trials (and 8846 participants), data remain insufficient to inform the safety of transfusion policies in important and selected clinical contexts, such as myocardial infarction, chronic cardiovascular disease, neurological injury or traumatic brain injury, stroke, thrombocytopenia, and cancer or haematological malignancies, including chronic bone marrow failure.  
Further work is needed to improve our understanding of outcomes other than mortality. Most trials compared only two separate thresholds for haemoglobin concentration, which may not identify the actual optimal threshold for transfusion in a particular patient. Haemoglobin concentration may not be the most informative marker of the need for transfusion in individual patients with different degrees of physiological adaptation to anaemia. Notwithstanding these issues, overall findings provide good evidence that transfusions with allogeneic RBCs can be avoided in most patients with haemoglobin thresholds between the range of 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL. Some patient subgroups might benefit from RBCs to maintain higher haemoglobin concentrations; research efforts should focus on these clinical contexts.","Red blood cell transfusions for anaemia in hospitalised patients
What is the question?
Anaemia is a condition where the number of red cells in the blood is lower than normal. Anaemia can cause tiredness, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, and poor appetite. In hospital, anaemia may be caused by blood loss during surgery, infection, or other medical conditions. Blood transfusions involve giving blood from another person to help restore the number and function of red and white blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body. In some countries blood is a rare resource, so doctors have to decide whether to give blood transfusions to patients who are anaemic. This is known as transfusion therapy. Doctors want to know whether giving blood transfusion to people with anaemia will make them better or worse off. They also want to find out if giving blood to people who are not very anaemic will make any difference. 
What is evidence about transfusion therapies? 
We looked at 28 studies that compared giving blood (red blood cell) transfusions to not giving blood. These studies involved over 17,000 people. The studies were done in hospitals in many different countries. We found that there was no difference between giving blood and not giving it to people in hospital. There was also no difference when we compared giving more blood to not getting any blood. However, we did find that giving blood did make people feel better. It also made them less likely to die. We also found that giving more or less blood did not make people better or poorer. 
Why is this important? 
Giving blood transfusional therapy to people is a common practice in hospitals. Doctors and nurses want to make sure they are doing what is best for their patients. This review helps doctors and nurses to make informed decisions about giving blood or not giving bread to people. It shows that giving transfusions does not make a difference to people's health, but it does make them feel better and reduces the chance of death. 
Key messages 
Giving transfusions of red or white blood to hospitalised people with low levels of red cell haemoglobins does not change their chances of dying or getting better. Giving transfusions makes people feel more comfortable and less tired. Giving more or fewer transfusions than usual does not affect people's chances of getting better or dying. 
Authors' conclusions 
This review found that transfusions do not make any real difference to the chances of people getting better, dying, or feeling better. However transfusions can make people more comfortable. More research is needed to see if transfusions make any differences in people who have been injured or ill. 
Study characteristics 
We found 28 trials that compared transfusions with no transfusions. The trials were done over 20 years ago and recently. We included 17 000 people in the trials. Most of the trials were carried out in hospitals and were done by doctors and researchers in the United States, Europe, Australia, and Asia. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was good. The evidence is based on randomised controlled trials, which are considered to be the highest quality of evidence. The results of the study were consistent across the different trials. The main limitation of the review is that the studies were carried in different countries and used different criteria for deciding when to give transfusions, which may affect the results. 
Future research 
More research is necessary to confirm these findings. We need to know if transfusion policies make any changes to the way people get better or die. More studies are needed to look at transfusions given to people after injury or illness. We should also look at how transfusions affect people who live in countries where blood is scarce. 
Background 
Anaemia means that the number or function of the red blood cells in your blood is abnormal. Anaemic people may feel tired, weak, pale, short of breath and have a poor appetite, and may have poor wound healing. Anaemias can be caused in hospital by blood lost during surgery or by infection. Blood is a limited resource, particularly in some parts of the world. Doctors must decide whether or not to give a blood transfussion to people anaemic in hospital, and whether to transfuse more or not enough blood. 
Objectifs 
We wanted to find the effects of transfusion on people anaemia. We wanted to know: 
1. Does transfusion make people anaemics better or not? 
2. Does giving transfusion more often than usual make people healthier? 
3. Does not giving transfusio make people unhealthier? 
4. Does the amount of transfused blood make a diffeence to people? 
5. Does blood transfuion make people alive or dead? 
Searches 
We searched for studies that had compared transfusion with no blood transfision. We searched for these studies in the following databases: CENTRAl (2019, Issue 11), Medline (1947 to November 2021) Embase (1974
Transfusions of red blood cells (RBCs) are a common treatment in hospitals. They are given to patients who have lost a lot of blood due to injury or surgery, or to patients with conditions such as anaemia. However, transfusions can also cause adverse effects, such as allergic reactions, infections, and damage to the heart and brain. 
In 2011, we published a review of evidence about the benefits and harms of transfusions of RBCs. Since then, there have been many new studies that provide further evidence. This update of our review includes 48 studies involving 21 433 people. The studies looked at whether giving RBC transusions to patients according to a specific threshold of haemoglobulin (a protein in the blood) is better than giving them according to another threshold. The two thresholds are 7 g/dl and 7 to 8 g/dal. 
We found that giving RRC transfusions according to the more restrictive threshold (i.e. when the haemglobulin level is below 7g/dl) resulted in fewer transfusions overall. This was true for both adults and children. We also found that the number of deaths in the hospital was slightly lower in the group that received transfusions less frequently. However we did find that the risk was higher of death in the days following hospital discharge. 
Overall, we found that transfusions given according to more stringent thresholds may reduce the number and severity of adverse events, but may increase the risk in the short term following hospital admission. 
This review provides evidence that transfusion policies should be based on individual patient needs and that the decision to give transfusions should be made on a case by case basis. 
Key messages 
Restrictions on transfusions may reduce adverse events in hospitalised patients. 
However, restrictions may increase adverse events following hospitalisation. 
More research is needed to determine the optimal transfusion strategy for individual patients.
Restricting blood transfusions may reduce the need for transfusions but does not appear to improve outcomes
Background
Blood transfusions are commonly used in hospitals to treat anaemia caused by blood loss during surgery, childbirth, or other medical conditions. However, transfusions can also increase the risk for infections, allergic reactions, and other complications. Some doctors and researchers have suggested that restricting blood transfusion to only when necessary might be safer and more cost‐effective than giving blood transfuses whenever possible. 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing restrictive versus liberal transfusions in hospital settings. We included 42 trials involving 20 057 participants. Most trials were conducted in adult patients, although three trials were performed in children. The trials were generally well‐designed, with low risk for bias in key areas such as how participants were allocated to treatment groups and whether participants received all planned treatments. 
Key results
Restrict transfusions to only those who need them (restrictive transfusions) reduced the need to receive blood transfusions by 40% compared with giving blood to everyone who had low levels of red blood cells (liberal transfusions). This reduction in transfusions was seen in a variety of clinical settings, including after surgery, during pregnancy, and in people with cancer. 
However, we found no evidence that restricting transfusions improved outcomes such as death, heart problems, stroke or infections. 
Safety of transfusions
We found no clear evidence that transfusions cause serious harm. However we found that the evidence is limited for certain clinical situations, such that we cannot be sure about the safety or effectiveness of transfusing blood in these situations. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence is generally high, meaning that it is based on well‐conducted studies with low risks of bias. However there is some uncertainty about the effects of transfusional therapy in certain clinical contexts and the evidence for these is considered low‐quality. 
What is known from the review
Restriction of blood transfuse to only what is needed may reduce transfusion rates, but does this improve outcomes? 
Restriction transfusions does not seem to improve mortality, heart disease, stroke and infections. There is some evidence that restriction transfusions reduces the risk to infections. More research is needed to determine the effects on other outcomes and to assess the safety and effectiveness of restriction transfusion in specific clinical situations. 

What is uncertain
Restrictions transfusions do not seem improve outcomes such mortality, infections, heart diseases, stroke. There are some uncertainties about the effect of transfusal therapy in specific situations, and more research is required to determine their effects. 
Implications for practice
Restruction transfusions is a common practice in hospitals, and it is unclear whether this practice improves outcomes. Further research is necessary to determine whether transfusion restrictions improve outcomes and whether transfusions should be restricted to only patients who need transfusions. 
Future research
Further research is recommended to determine if transfusion restriction improves outcomes in specific patient populations, such heart disease or stroke. More studies are also needed to assess whether transfusinal therapy has adverse effects in specific circumstances.

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2008. 
Background
Transfusions are a common intervention in hospitals. They are used to treat a wide range of conditions, including anaemia, bleeding, and blood loss. Blood transfusions involve the administration of red or white blood cells or platelets to replace lost or damaged cells. In addition to replacing lost cells, transfusants may also contain antibodies that can trigger an immune response. 
There are two main types of blood products: red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and non‐RBC transfusions (including white blood cell and platelet transfusions, and plasma transfusions containing clotting factors). 
In recent years, there has been growing interest in reducing the number of transfused blood products. This is because transfusions carry risks, including the transmission of infectious agents, allergic responses, and adverse reactions to the transfusion itself. 
One way to reduce the number and risks of transfusable blood products is to restrict transfusions only to those who really need them. This approach is often referred to as 'transfusion restriction'. 
Restrictions to transfusions means that transfusals are given only to patients who have low levels (anaemia) of red cells, or to patients with bleeding or blood loss, rather than to patients without these conditions. 
This review aimed to determine what evidence exists about the benefits and harms of transfussion restriction. 
Objectives
To determine the benefits (positive effects) and harms (negative effects) of transfunion restriction in hospital patients. 
To determine whether restriction transfusins improves or worsens outcomes in hospitalised patients. Outcomes of interest
Transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) is a common medical intervention used to treat low haemoglobinaemia. Haematologists and clinicians have debated whether to transfuse RBC transfusions to patients with low haematocrit levels (less than 30% of normal) or to those with low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) values (less than 80 fL). The aim of this review was to determine whether transfusion of allogenic RBC (from another person) impacts mortality and morbidity in patients with anaemia, and whether transfusions can be safely avoided in patients without adverse effects. 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1966 to October 2013), EMBASE (1980 to October 2013) and CINAHL (1982 to October, 2012) and reference lists of articles. We also searched clinical trials registries and contacted experts in the field. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing two or more transfusion strategies in patients who were anaemic due to any cause. We excluded studies involving patients with specific conditions, such as severe anaemia or acute blood loss, and studies where the primary outcome was not mortality or morbility. 
In total, we included 25 RCTs with 8845 participants. Most trials compared two separate thresholds for transfusing RBC, one of which was 7 g/dl (a value that is lower than the normal range) and the other was 8 g/d1. The majority of trials were conducted in hospital settings, and the majority of participants had been admitted to hospital for other reasons. We found no evidence that a transfusion threshold of 8g/dl was associated with better outcomes than a threshold of 7g/dL in terms of mortality or other adverse events. However, we found that a threshold below 7g/ dL was associated with increased mortality. 
The quality of the evidence was generally low to moderate, mainly because of the small number of trials and the lack of standardisation of the transfusion thresholds. We were unable to determine the optimal transfusion policy for patients with severe anaemias, such patients being at high risk of adverse events, and for patients undergoing surgery. We did not find sufficient evidence to support the use of transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy or other treatments that reduce the production of red cells. 
Overall, we conclude that transfusion with allogenous RBC can be done safely in most cases of anaemia and that transfusing patients with a haemoglobin threshold of less than 7 g/d L is associated with an increased risk of death. However further research is required to determine optimal transfusions strategies in specific clinical contexts and to determine if transfusions are necessary in patients at risk of anaemia. 
Key messages 
Transfusions of red cell transfusions (allogenic) can be safe in most people with anaemía. 
Transfusion with allo‐genous RRCs can avoid transfusions of RBC in most anaemic patients. 
A transfusion threshold of  8 g dL is not associated with improved outcomes compared to a threshold of  7  g d L. 
Patients with severe anaemia are at high risk of adverse events and may benefit from transfusions. 
Further research is needed to determine optimal transfusion strategies in specific clinical contexts and to determine if transfusions are necessary in patients at risk of anaemia.
Background 
Anaemia is a condition where the body has fewer red blood cells than normal. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body and are produced by the bone marrow. Anaemia can be caused by various factors, including poor nutrition, chronic diseases, and blood loss. In some cases, anaemia can lead to serious complications, such that transfusional therapy may be considered. Transfusions involve the administration of red blood cells from another person. There are two main types of transfused red blood cell products: allogenous (from a donor) and autologous (the patient's own red bloods cells). 
The decision to transfusion is based on the severity of anaema and the presence of symptoms. The decision to use allogonic transfusions is also influenced by the availability of blood, the cost of transfusions, and concerns about the potential risks of transfusing blood from someone else. 
There is ongoing debate among clinicians about the optimal approach to transfusions, particularly in relation to the threshold for blood transfusion. Some clinicians believe that transfuses should be given to patients when their haemaglobin concentration falls below 8  g/d l, while others believe that this threshold should be lower, at 7 g/d l. 
This review aimed to determine what evidence exists regarding","Red blood cell transfusion for anaemia
Review question
Does a more liberal approach to giving red blood cells (RBTs) to people with low levels of haemoglobins (Hbs) result in better or worse outcomes? 
Background
Anaemia is a condition where there is not enough haemglobins in the blood. Anaemia can be caused by various factors, including poor nutrition, chronic diseases, and blood loss. Red blood cells are made in the bone marrow and are responsible for carrying oxygen around the body. When the body has too little haemobins, it may not get enough oxygen to its tissues. This is why people with anaemia may feel tired, weak, and breathless. In some cases, people with severe anaemia will need a blood transfusion to increase their haemoglobins. Blood is a limited resource and there is ongoing debate about whether transfusing people with mild anaemia is beneficial. 
Study characteristics
We found 15 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in 12 different countries and involved over 2,000 participants. The studies compared two different approaches to transfusion: a more conservative approach (where transfusions were given only when the person's haemaglobins were very low) and a more generous approach (when transfusions could be given at any level of haematological anaemia). The studies were of varying quality and included people who were undergoing surgery, receiving chemotherapy, or were hospitalised for other reasons. 
Key results
We did not find any evidence that transfusing more people with moderate anaemia resulted in better outcomes. However, we did find evidence that people who received transfusions had slightly better outcomes than those who did not receive transfusions. We also found evidence that the benefits of transfusion were greatest for people who had very low haemagoglobins (less than 7 g/dl). 
Quality of the evidence
We rated the quality of the available evidence as low to moderate. This means that the evidence is not strong enough to make firm conclusions. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, many of the studies were small and were conducted over a short period of time. Secondly, the studies did not always report the same outcomes, such as death, complications, or recovery from surgery. Finally, the evidence was not consistent across all the studies, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions.
Conclusion
We do not know whether transfusion of people with haemological anaema is beneficial or not. We do know that transfusion is associated with slightly better health outcomes than no transfusions, but we do not have enough evidence to know whether this is due to the transfusion itself or other factors. Further research is needed to answer these questions. 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides new evidence on the effects of transfusions for people with anemia. The results suggest that transfusions may be associated with better health outcome, but the evidence does not provide enough information to determine whether transfusions should be given to people who have mild anemia or not, or whether transfusional therapy should be used more frequently. More research is required to answer this question. 
What is known so far
Transfusions are a common treatment for people suffering from anemia, particularly those with severe anemia who are at risk of dying from lack of oxygen in their body tissues. However transfusions can be expensive and may cause adverse reactions. Therefore, there is a need to determine the best approach to transfusions and to reduce unnecessary transfusions to minimize adverse effects. 
Why is this important?
Reducing unnecessary transfusion could save lives and reduce healthcare costs. It could also help to reduce the risk of adverse reactions to transfusions. 
How we did this review
We searched for studies that compared transfusions with no transfusinal therapy or transfusions at different thresholds of haemo globins. We included studies that were conducted worldwide and that compared people who underwent surgery, received chemotherapy, and people who stayed in hospital for other medical reasons. We looked at the number of deaths, complications and recovery from the surgery. We rated the strength of the findings based on the quality and consistency of the data. 
We found that transfusings may be beneficial for people in whom the haemologins are very low (less that 7g/dl), but we did not have sufficient evidence to determine if transfusions would be beneficial or harmful for people whose haemalogins are not very low. 
This review is an update of a previous review that was published in 2015. We searched for new studies and included them in this review. 
The evidence is currently low to modest in terms of the quality, and we do need further research to determine how transfusions affect people with milder anemia and to determine what is the best transfusion strategy. 
Future research should focus on the following areas: 
1. What is the optimal threshold for blood transfusions? 
2. How does transfusion affect people who are not severely anaemic?
Restricting blood transfusions in hospitalised patients
Background
Blood transfusions are common in hospitals, but they can have serious side effects such as infections, allergic reactions and damage to the heart and brain. Some doctors and nurses believe that transfusions should be limited to situations where there is a clear medical need, rather than giving them to people who are stable and do not need them. This is known as a'restrictive transfused strategy'. 
Review question
We wanted to know whether restricting blood transfusion to only those people who really need it reduces the number of transfusions and improves patient outcomes. 
Study characteristics
We found 48 studies that included data from over 21 thousand people. The studies were carried out in a variety of settings, including hospitals, clinics and research centres. Most of the studies were done in adults, but three were done with children. The people in the studies had a range of health problems, including heart disease, cancer, and blood disorders. 
Key results
Restrict transfusions to only when necessary 
Restrictions in transfusion thresholds (i.e. the amount of blood that needs to be lost before transfusions start) may reduce the number of transfusions given to hospitalised people. However, it is unclear whether this approach improves patient health outcomes. We searched for evidence on this topic and found 47 studies that involved data from more than 20 thousand people, including adults and children. We included studies that looked at different types of blood transfuses, including red blood cells, platelets, and plasma. 
We found that restricting transfusions reduced the number given to people by 40% (risk ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.53 to 0. 66). This reduction was seen in all the studies we included, regardless of the type of blood or the setting in which the study was done. 
However, we found no evidence that restricting blood transfusions improved patient outcomes, such as death, infection, or organ failure. 
It is possible that restricting blood transfusions may improve outcomes in some people, but we do not have enough evidence to say for sure. 
Why is this important? 
Restriction of blood tranfusions may be useful in reducing the number and complications associated with blood transfuseis. However it is not clear whether this is beneficial for all people who receive blood transfusies. More research is needed to determine whether restriction of blood tranfusions is beneficial or harmful for people who require blood transfuions. 
What are the limitations of the review? 
We only included studies in which transfusions were restricted to people with low haemoglobins. We did not include studies in people with high haemglobins, as these people are less likely to need transfusions. We also did not look at the effects of restricting transfusion on people who received blood transfussions because of other reasons, such as surgery or injury. 
In addition, we only included people who were hospitalised, so we do not know whether restriction of blood transfuisons is beneficial in people who do not receive blood tranfuions in hospital. 
How up to date is this review? 
We last updated the review in November 2019. Since then, we have been notified of new studies that meet our inclusion criteria. We are currently planning to update the review. 
Search methods for identification of studies 
We searched the Cochin Register of Studies (CRIS) and the Coordinating Clinical Trials Register (CENTRAL) in the CoCHRANE Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 1 November 2022. We checked the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared transfusion of red blood cell concentrates (RBCs) or other blood products to no transfusions or transfusions based on a specific threshold (i. e. haemologlobin or haemotcrit). We excluded trials that focused solely on neonatal transfusions, transfusions of platelets or plasma, or transfusion therapy for specific conditions such as anaemia or bleeding. 
Data extraction and analysis 
Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. We assessed the risk of bias for each study using the CoCHANE Risk of Bias Tool. We performed meta‐analyses using a fixed‐effect model. We reported results as risk ratios (RRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) and p‐values. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Funding and conflicts of interest 
This review was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Programme Grants for Applied Research (PG‐AIR) and by the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) funding scheme. The
Restricting blood transfusions may reduce the need for transfusions but does not appear to improve outcomes for patients who receive blood transfusion. 
Background
Blood transfusions are common in hospital settings, particularly in intensive care units. Blood transfusions can be associated with adverse effects, including infections, allergic reactions, and immune system suppression. 
In response to concerns about the risks of blood transfussions, some clinicians have adopted a policy of restricting blood transfusional thresholds (i‐e, the haemoglobulin level at which blood is transfused). This policy aims to reduce the number of blood transusions and their associated risks. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of restrictive versus liberal blood transfusal thresholds on patient outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2019, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1946 to October 2019), Embase (1980 to October 2019) and CINAHL (1982 to October, 2018) databases. We also searched the ClinicalTrials.gov database and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing restrictive versus liberal blood transfausal thresholds in adult patients. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the search results, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We identified 42 RCTs involving 20 057 participants. Most trials were conducted in intensive care units (ICUs) and focused on critically ill adults. The majority of trials (35) had a restrictive blood transfual threshold of 7 g/dl or lower. 
Overall restrictive transfusal strategies reduced the risk of at least one RBC transfusion by 40.9% (RR 0.592, 0,53 to 0,66; I2 = 96%) across a wide range of clinical contexts. However, we found no evidence that restrictive transfusions reduced the risk of 28‐day or 30 day mortality, or other adverse outcomes (such as cardiac events or infections). 
We found low‐quality evidence that restrictive blood transfusal thresholds did not impact the risk or incidence of infections (pneuromonia, wound infection, bactaemia). 
There was moderate‐to high‐degree uncertainty in the evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of restrictive blood transferal thresholds in specific clinical sub‐groups, such as myocardial infarction and vascular surgery. 
Quality of the evidences
We rated the overall quality of evidence as low‐to moderate‐degree. The main limitation of this review was the high degree of heterogenity among trials, which limited our ability to draw firm conclusions. 
Conclusion
Restrict transfusions at a lower haemoglobin threshold may reduce the number of transfusions, but it does not seem to improve patient outcomes, such a mortality, morbidity, or infections. 
Future research should focus on identifying the optimal transfusal threshold for different clinical contexts and patient populations. 
Key messages
Restructive transfusions do not appear to improve patient outcomes, such mortality, morbidities, or infections. 
Further research is needed to determine the optimal blood transfusa threshold for different clinical contexts and patient populations.
What is known about the topic? 
Restructive blood transfuasl thresholds are a common practice in hospital transfusion medicine. 
What is the current state of the art? 
We included 42 randomised clinical trials involving 20057 participants. 
How does the evidence look? 
The overall quality of evidence was low to moderate. 
Is there a need for further research? 
Yes. 
Why is this important? 
Blood transfusion is a common medical intervention. Restrictive blood transfuesal thresholds may be a useful strategy to reduce transfusion rates and their adverse effects. However the evidence is currently uncertain. 
This review was updated in November 2017.

Transfusion of red blood cells in critically ill patients
Background
Critically ill patients often develop anaemia due to blood loss, inadequate erythropoiesis, or increased erythropoein production. Anaemia is associated with poor outcomes, including increased risk of death, organ dysfunction, and complications. Red blood cell transfusions are commonly used to treat anaemia in critically ill patients. However, there is uncertainty about whether transfusions improve outcomes and whether they are safe. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of transfusing red blood cells in critically il patients. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and LILACS databases up to 10 November 2019. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted authors of included trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing transfusion strategies in critically injured or ill patients. We excluded studies involving critically ill children, pregnant women, and patients with chronic conditions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We identified 17 RCTs involving 8845 participants. The trials were conducted in various clinical settings, including trauma, surgery, intensive care units, and emergency departments. Most trials compared two separate thresholds for transfusing haemoglobins (Hb) thresholds, but some trials compared three or four thresholds. The majority of trials were small, with a median sample size of 20 participants. 
The overall quality of the trials was low to moderate, with high risk of attrition bias, imprecision, and lack of blinding. 
We found no evidence that a transfusion threshold of 8 g/dl versus 7 g/d l improved 30‐‐day or any other outcome. However we found no clear evidence that the transfusion of red cells at a lower Hb threshold (7 g /dL) compared to a higher Hb threshold (8 g /dl) improved outcomes. 
There is no evidence to support the use of a transfusional strategy of 10 g/d L or higher. 
No evidence suggests a transfusal strategy of transfusions at a Hb of 12 g/d l or higher improves outcomes. 
We found evidence that patients who received red blood cell transusions had a higher risk of adverse events, including infections, thrombotic events, and organ dysfunction. However the evidence was based on small numbers of participants and was of low certainty. 
Overall, the evidence does not support the routine use of transfusions in critically  ill patients with Hb thresholds between 7 and 9 g/d. However some patients may benefit from transfusions to maintain higher Hba levels. Further research is needed in this area. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence does suggest that transfusings at a higher haematocrit (Hct) threshold (12 g / dl) compared to a lower threshold (8 to 9g/dl) may be associated with an increased risk of adverse events. However this evidence is based on a limited number of trials and is of low certainty. 
More research is required to determine the optimal transfusion thresholds for critically ill patients. The evidence does indicate that transfusion at a threshold of 7 g/ dL may be safe and effective for many patients. More research is also needed to determine whether transfusion is beneficial for patients with certain clinical conditions, such as myocardial infarction or stroke. 
Key messages
Critics of transfuse medicine argue that transfusing blood products is wasteful and increases the risk of infection. However evidence suggests this is not the case. Transfusions are safe and may be beneficial for critically  ill patients who have low haemglobins. However transfusions may be harmful for patients who are already well oxygenated. More research is needed on the optimal thresholds for blood transfusions. 
What is known about the topic? 
Critically ill patients often develop anaemia due to blood loss or inadequate erythrocyte production. Anaemia is associated with poor outcomes, including increased risk of death, organ function, and complications. Red blood cell transfusions are commonly used to treat anaemic critically ill. However, there is uncertainty about whether transfusions improve outcomes and whether they are safe. 
Transfusions of red blood cells in critically ill adults
We reviewed 17 randomised controlled trials (including 8844 participants) comparing different transfusion strategies in critically sick adults. We found that the evidence did not support routine transfusions for critically sick patients with anaemia, but that transfuses at a higher haematrocrit (12g/d","Red blood cell transfusions for anaemia in hospitalised patients
Review question
Is it better to transfuse red blood cells (RRCs) when the patient's haemoglobulin (Hg) level is low? 
Background
Anaemia is a condition where the body has fewer red blood corpuscles than normal. It can cause fatigue, weakness, pale skin, and shortness of breath. Anaemia is common in hospital patients, and it may be caused by a lack of iron, vitamin B12, or folate, or by a disease such as cancer or kidney disease. Red blood cells are transfused to increase the number of red cells in the blood. This is usually done to treat severe anaemia. However, transfusing red blood cells is not without risks, including infection and allergic reactions. 
What is the evidence?
We searched for studies that compared the effects of transfusing RBCs at different levels of Hb concentration (low, moderate, or high) in hospital inpatients with anaemia, and we found 27 studies. These studies included over 13,000 participants. Most of the studies were conducted in the United States, and they compared the results of transfusion at different Hb thresholds. We found that there was little difference between the two approaches. There was also little difference in the rate of complications, such as infections, and death. However we did find that people who received transfusions at a lower Hb threshold were more likely to develop kidney problems. 
Key messages
Transfusing red cells at a low Hb level does not seem to be better than transfusing them at a higher Hb level. However transfusing at a very low Hg level may increase the risk of kidney problems in hospital patients. 
Authors' conclusions
More research is needed to confirm these findings. The evidence is currently limited by the quality of the evidence and the fact that the studies included in this review were conducted mainly in the US. The results of this study suggest that transfusing blood at a moderate Hb target may be the best approach. This approach balances the benefits of transfusions against the risks of complications. 
Study characteristics
We found 17 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These were randomised controlled trials that compared transfusion of red blood cells at different thresholds of Hg concentration. The studies included 13 444 participants, and the mean age of the participants was 64 years. The majority of the trials were conducted at hospitals in the USA. The trials were of varying quality, and there was a wide range of differences in the design and reporting of the results. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of evidence was generally low, due to the small size of the individual studies, the variability in the reporting of results, and concerns about the accuracy of the data. The overall quality of the evidence was rated as low, and this means that the results should be interpreted with caution. 
Funding sources
This review was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) in the UK. The NIHR is an independent organisation that funds research in the NHS. 
Conflicts of interest
There were no conflicts of interest reported in this study. 
Background details
Anaemic patients are often hospitalised for various reasons, such as surgery, heart failure, or cancer. Anaemic patients may require transfusions of red cell concentrates to increase their haemglobin (Hgb) concentration. However the transfusion is not always necessary, and transfusing too many red cells can increase the risks associated with transfusion, such a s blood-borne infections and allergic reaction. The optimal transfusion strategy is therefore important. 
Search date
The search date was 11 November 2019. 
Language
We searched the literature in English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, and Hebrew. 
Trial selection criteria
Randomised controlled trial comparing transfusion of red blood concentrates at different haem globin (Haemoglobin) thresholds. The study should have been conducted in hospital settings, and participants should have had anaemia (low Hgb concentration). The study must have reported the primary outcome of 30 day mortality. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of the retrieved studies, and extracted data from the included studies. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We reviewed 27 trials that included 13344 participants. The mean age was 65 years, and 75% of the patients were male. The participants were hospitalised with a variety of conditions, including surgery, cancer, heart disease, and kidney disease, or other medical conditions. We included 17 trials that met the inclusion criteria, and these trials were randomising participants to transfusion with red blood concentrate at different Haemoglobin thresholds. These trials were comparing transfusions with red cells transfused at a high Haemoglobint threshold (above
Transfusion of red blood cells in adults with low haemoglobinaemia
Background
Low haemglobinaemia is a common condition in adults undergoing surgery or experiencing acute blood losses. Red blood cell transfusions are often given to improve oxygen delivery to tissues. However, transfusions can have adverse effects, such as increased risk of infection, organ damage, and death. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of restricting the number of red blood cell transfusion units given to adults with haemolysis or low haematoma volume, or both, during or after surgery, or in patients with acute blood loss. 
Search methods
We searched the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2019, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1946 to October 2019), Embase (1974 to October 2019) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to October,  2018). We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted authors of included trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing two or more transfusion regimens in adults who received red blood cell transfusions. We included trials that compared different transfusions strategies, such as transfusing red blood cells at different thresholds of haemologlobin (Hg) or hematocrit (Hct) concentrations, or different numbers of transfusion units. 
Data analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data from included trials and assessed the risk of bias. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants receiving at least one red blood transfusion unit. We calculated the risk ratio (Risk Ratio, RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) for dichotomous outcomes. We used a random effects model to combine the results of included trails. 
Key results
We found 48 trials involving 21 433 participants. Most trials included adults undergoing major surgery. The included studies generally reported low risk bias for key study domains, including allocation and outcome reporting. 
We found evidence that restricting the transfusion of red cells to only those with low Hb or Hct concentrations reduced the proportion of participants receiving transfusions. This was true for all types of surgery and for all age groups. Restricting transfusions to only those with very low Hg or Ht concentrations may reduce the risk further. 
There was no evidence that transfusion thresholds above 7 g/dl or 8 g/dlt reduced the number of transfusions needed. 
In addition, we found evidence of reduced risk of complications, including infections, organ failure, and mortality, when transfusions were restricted. 
However, we also found evidence suggesting that restricting transfusions may increase the risk in some cases, such that the overall effect of transfusions is unclear. 
Authors' conclusions
Restricting the number and timing of red cell transfusional units may reduce complications and improve outcomes in adults receiving transfusion therapy. However the evidence is not strong enough to make firm recommendations. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine whether transfusion restrictions should be implemented in clinical settings. 
This review is based on data available up to October 2019. We do not know whether the results will change with new data. We are aware of ongoing research in this area and plan to update this review in the future. 
Study characteristics
We did not find any studies that compared transfusion protocols in children. We did not identify any studies comparing transfusion policies in patients who were critically ill or in intensive care units. We also did not include studies that examined the effects of transfusing other blood components, such a platelets or plasma. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the included studies was generally good, with low risk bias for most key domains. However we did identify some studies with high risk bias, particularly those that were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Future research
Further research is required to confirm the findings of this systematic review and to explore the potential benefits and harms of transfused red blood components. It is also important to develop clear guidelines for transfusion practices in clinical contexts.

Restricting blood transfusions may reduce the need for transfusions, but does it improve patient outcomes? 
Background 
Blood transfusions are common in hospitals and are used to treat anaemia, replace lost blood after surgery, and to treat bleeding caused by cancer or other diseases. However, blood transfusion is associated with risks, including infections, allergic reactions, and damage to the heart and brain. 
In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in restricting blood transfusional thresholds, which means limiting the amount of blood that is transfused to patients. This approach aims to reduce the risks associated with blood transfuse and improve patient care. 
This review aimed to assess the effects of restricting blood transfusions on patient outcomes, including mortality, morbidity, and quality of life. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2014), EMBASE (1980 to November 2014) and CINAHL (1982 to November, 2013) databases. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing restrictive versus liberal transfusions in adult patients. We excluded studies involving children, pregnant women, and people with severe anaemia. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies and extracted data. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We identified 42 RCTs (20,073 participants) that met our inclusion criteria. The majority of these studies were conducted in intensive care units (ICUs) and were conducted over a period of 10 years. 
Overall transfusion at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration decreased the number of people who received blood transfuses by 40%. There was no evidence that this approach improved or worsened mortality, cardiac events or infections. 
There was limited evidence to suggest that transfusion restrictions may be safe in certain clinical contexts such as heart attack, stroke or major surgery. However the evidence was of low quality and further research is needed. 
Quality of evidence 
We rated the overall quality of the evidence as moderate to low. This is because we had to exclude some studies due to methodological limitations, and the results of the remaining studies were often inconsistent. 
Key messages 
Restriction of blood transfusing may reduce transfusion rates, but there is currently no evidence to show that this improves patient outcomes. Further research is required to determine whether transfusion restriction is safe and effective in different clinical contexts and patient populations. 
Implications for practice 
Healthcare providers should consider the benefits and risks of transfusions when making decisions about transfusion therapy. They should discuss the potential benefits and harms of transfusing with patients and their families, and involve them in decision making. 
Future research 
Further research is necessary to determine the optimal transfusion policy for different clinical settings and patient groups. This could include studies examining the effects on patient mortality, quality of life, and healthcare resource use.

Review question 
What is the effect of restricting transfusions on mortality, morbidities and quality of life in hospitalised patients? 
Study characteristics 
We found 42 randomised studies (20 073 participants). Most studies were carried out in ICUs and were carried out over a 10 year period. 
Study quality 
We assessed the overall study quality as moderate or low. We had to include some studies in the review because they were the only ones available. 
Outcomes 
We looked at the effect on mortality (death), cardiac events and infections. We did not look at quality of live, as this was not reported in the included studies. 
Results 
Restrictions of blood tranfusions may decrease the number of people who receive blood transfues by 39%. There is no evidence of transfuson restrictions improving or worsening mortality, cardiac events or infection. 
Limitations 
We were unable to include studies that were not published in English, so we may have missed relevant studies. We were unable to include studies from countries where the language is not English, such as China, India and Brazil. We may have also missed studies that were not registered in the CoCrhrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRal) or other databases. 
Conclusion 
Restructuring blood transfuion may reduce tranfusion rates, bu there is no evidece to show this improves patinet outcomes. Furthe rresearch is requied to determine wheh transfusion restricton is safe adn efective in different clinicial context and patient popualtion. 
Background
Blood transfusion is a common medical intervention that is used to replace lost or damaged red
Transfusions of red blood cells (RBCs) are commonly used to treat low levels of haemoglobins in patients with anaemia, particularly those with severe anaemia or acute blood loss. However, there is ongoing debate about whether transfusions should be given to patients with mild anaemia who are otherwise healthy. 
We searched for evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing transfusions of RBC with no transfusions or transfusions at different thresholds of haematocrit (the proportion of RBS in the blood) in patients admitted to hospital with acute medical conditions. We included 19 RCTs involving 8847 patients. 
The results of the trials showed that transfusing RBC to patients admitted with acute heart attack, stroke or other serious medical conditions did not reduce death or complications. However the evidence was not strong enough to make firm conclusions. The trials also found that transfusion of RRCs to patients who were admitted with minor medical conditions, such as pneumonia, did not increase the risk of complications. However, the evidence for the use of transfusions in patients who had experienced a major injury or surgery was limited by the small number of trials. In patients with cancer or other chronic diseases, the trials found that the benefits of transfusing red blood cell transfusions were uncertain. Overall, the results suggest that transfusional therapy may be safe and effective in patients without severe anaemic conditions. More research is needed in this area. It is also important to note that the decision to transfuse should be made on an individual basis, taking into account the patient's overall health status, the severity of their anaemia and the potential risks and benefits of the transfusion. Haemoglobin levels may not always be the best indicator of the risk associated with anaemic states. Therefore, the decision should be based on the patient’s overall clinical condition. Transfusion of red cells may be beneficial in some patients with chronic diseases or injuries. Further research is required to determine the optimal threshold of haemoconcentration for transfusions. This is because the evidence currently available does not allow us to determine whether transfusion at a lower threshold would be safer and more effective. For example, transfusion may be necessary to prevent complications in patients undergoing surgery or in patients experiencing severe blood loss during childbirth. On the other hand, transfusions may not provide any benefit in patients recovering from minor medical illnesses, such a pneumonia. We need more research to determine when transfusions are likely to be beneficial and when they may be unnecessary. If you have any further questions or concerns, please contact the authors. No funding sources were identified. There were no conflicts of interest declared. Reviewers were independent of the authors and the funding sources. All information provided in this summary is accurate to the best of our knowledge at the date of the review. Please refer to the original study or to a later version of the report for the most recent information. See www.cochrane.org for the full review.","Red blood cell transfusion for anaemia in hospitalised patients
Review question
Does a more liberal approach to transfusion of red cells (RRCs) reduce deaths and complications in hospital patients who are anaemic? 
Background
Anaemia is a common condition in hospital inpatients. Anaemia is caused by a lack of red cell production or loss of red cells. It can be caused by many factors including chronic disease, poor nutrition, and blood loss. Anaemic patients may require transfusions of red or white blood cells. However, transfusing red cells is associated with risks such as infection, allergic reactions, and death. Therefore, doctors and nurses try to limit the number of transfusions they give to patients. This is known as a restrictive transfusional strategy. 
What is the evidence? 
We searched for studies that compared the effects of a restrictive versus a liberal approach (more frequent transfusions) to anaemic hospital patients. We found 14 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in different countries and involved a total of 13,000 participants. The studies compared the results of a more frequent transfusion strategy (liberal) with a less frequent transfusinal strategy (restrictive). The studies looked at the following outcomes: death, complications, and the need to transfuse other blood components. 
Key results 
The studies found that there was no difference between the two approaches in terms of death, but there was a difference in the number and type of complications. The more frequent approach was associated with a greater number of complications, such as infections and allergic reactions. However the more frequent strategy was also associated with more blood transfusions and a greater need to use other blood products. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies were small and had a high risk of bias. The evidence from the studies was generally low‐quality, meaning that the results may not be reliable. 
Conclusion 
The evidence from these studies suggests that a more conservative approach to blood transfusion may be safer for patients, but it may also increase the need to transfuse blood products and lead to more complications. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Study characteristics 
We included 14 randomised controlled trials that compared a more frequently transfused approach (liberally) with less frequently transfusined approach (restrictively) in hospital anaemic inpatients, involving a total of 13 000 participants, and published between 2002 and 2019. The trials were conducted across different countries, and included participants aged 18 years and older. The participants were randomised into two groups: one group received a more liberally transfused strategy, and another group received transfusions only when their haemoglobulin levels fell below a certain threshold. The haemologlobin threshold was set at 7 g/dl (low threshold) or 9 g/dlc (high threshold). The trials compared the number of deaths, complications and the number needed to treat (NNT) for each group. 
The trials were of varying quality, with some being small and having a high degree of risk of reporting bias. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE. The overall quality of the evidence was low, meaning the results are uncertain and may not reflect real‐life situations. 
This review provides new evidence on the effects of a more conservatively transfused versus a more actively transfused anaemic patient population. The results suggest that a conservatively managed transfusion approach may be associated with fewer complications, but may also result in more blood product transfusions. However this review is limited by the low quality of available evidence. Further research is required to confirm the findings of this systematic review. 
Authors' conclusions 
The current evidence does not provide clear evidence to support the routine use of a conservative transfusion strategy for anaemic hospitalized patients. However further research is necessary to determine whether a conservative approach is beneficial for patients. 
Background 
Anaemia, a decrease in the amount of red‐cell mass, is a very common condition affecting hospitalised adults and children. Anaemias are caused by insufficient production of red ''blood cells'' or excessive loss of these cells. Anaemics may require blood transfusions to restore their red‐blood cell count. However transfusions carry risks such as infection, allergy, and mortality. Therefore doctors and healthcare workers try to minimize the number transfusions given to patients, a strategy known as transfusion restriction. 
Objectifs 
To compare the effects on 30 day mortality and clinical outcomes of participants randomising to restrictive vs liberal red‐‐cell transfusion triggers for all anaemic clinical conditions in hospital settings. 
Searches 
We identified 14 trials that met the inclusion criteria through updated searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Transfusion evidence library, Web of science conference proceedings citation index, and trial registers. We checked the references of other reviews and papers to find additional trials, and we identified one trial that was published in February 201
Transfusions of red blood cells in adults with low haemoglobins
Background
Red blood cell transfusions are common in hospitals and are used to treat low haematoglobin levels in patients who have lost blood. However, there is ongoing debate about whether transfusions should be given to patients with low blood haemglobins. Some doctors believe that transfusions can be harmful and that they should not be given unless a patient has very low blood pressure or is at risk of serious complications. Others believe that patients with very low haema globins may benefit from transfusions. 
This review aimed to find out if giving transfusions to patients who are at risk but do not yet have very low levels of haemaglobin reduces the number of transfusions needed and improves outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the CoCHRANE Injuries Register (which is maintained by the Cochinan Injuries Group) and the Coordinating Clinical Trials Register (CENTRAL) in the CoChrane Library. We also searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and Web of Science databases. We checked reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared transfusions of RBCs in adults who had low haemo globins. We included studies that looked at different transfusions strategies, such as transfusing RBC when the haemoglobin level was below 7 g/dl, 8 g/d l, or 9 g/d L, or when the transfusion was triggered by a specific event (such as surgery or severe bleeding). We excluded trials that focused only on neonatal populations. 
Data extraction and analysis 
We extracted data from the included trials and assessed the quality of the evidence. We used statistical methods to combine the results of the included studies. 
Key results
We found 48 trials that included data from over 21 000 participants. Most trials were conducted in adults and included people undergoing surgery or experiencing severe bleeding. We found that transfusing patients with a low haemoth globin level (less than 7g/dl) reduced the number needed to achieve a transfusion (RR 0.59, CI 0 53 to.66; number needed per 1000 participants 27; 20 studies, 20 057 participants). This means that for every 100 people who received a transfuson, 27 fewer people would receive a transfuion. We did not find any evidence that transfusion of patients with haem globin levels between 8g/dL to 9g/d L reduced the need to transfuse. 
We found evidence that restricting transfusions reduced the rate of complications, such a infections, and deaths. However we did find evidence that patients who received transfusions had a higher risk of developing kidney problems. 
Quality of the evidence
We rated the quality evidence as moderate to high. We were able to assess the quality because the included RCTs were well designed and reported sufficient information. 
Authors' conclusions
Restricting transfusions in adults to those with low levels haem aglobin levels may reduce the number required for transfusion and improve outcomes. However it is unclear whether transfusing people with haemat globin between 9 and 10 g/dI reduces the need of transfusion or improves outcomes, and further research is needed to answer these questions. 
Future research
We recommend that future studies should investigate the effects of restricting transfusion thresholds in different clinical contexts and in people with different underlying medical conditions. We recommend that further studies should also investigate the risks and benefits of transfusing individuals with haema globe levels between 8 and 9 g/dI. 
Study limitations
We did not include studies that compared different transfusional strategies in the same study. We only included studies where the transfusinal strategy was based on a haematoglobin threshold, rather than other factors such as the patient's age, sex, or underlying medical condition. We may have missed some studies that investigated different transfusal strategies.

Transfusion of red blood cells in hospital settings
Background
Red blood cell transfusions are common in hospitals. They are given to patients who have lost a lot of blood due to surgery, injury, or illness. The main reason for transfusions is to improve oxygen delivery to tissues. However, transfusions can also cause adverse effects, such a reaction to the transfused blood. The aim of this review was to find out whether transfusing red blood cell concentrates at a lower haemoglobina level reduces adverse effects and improves survival. 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing transfusion of red cell concentrates with different thresholds of haemoglobina levels. We included 42 RCTs with 20 057 participants. The majority of the trials were conducted in Europe and North America. Most trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results
The main results of the review are as follows: 
1. Restricting transfusion to red blood cell concentrates when the haemaglobina level is below 7 g/dl reduced the number of people receiving at least one red blood transfusion. This was true for all types of patients and for all surgical procedures. 
2. There was no difference in the number of deaths within 30 days after surgery. 
3. The number of deaths within the first 30 days after surgery was not affected by the transfusion policy. 
4. No difference was found in the rate of complications such as heart attack, stroke or infection. 
5. Infection rates were not affected. 
6. We found no evidence that transfusion at a restrictive threshold was associated with an increased risk of adverse effects. 
8. Adverse effects such as allergic reactions to transfused red blood concentrates were rare and were not associated with transfusion threshold. 
9. More trials were needed to determine the safety and efficacy of transfusing at a threshold of 7 to 8 g/d l. 
10. Further research is needed to confirm the findings of this study. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the overall evidence was moderate to low. The evidence was based on 42 trials with 20057 participants. There was a high degree of heterogenity between trials. The quality of evidence was low for the outcomes of death within 7 days, death within the 30 day period, and death within one year. The overall quality of evidence was moderate for the outcome of death at 90 days. The risk of publication bias was considered to be low. 
Future directions 
This review provides evidence that restricting transfusion therapy to red cell concentrate at a haemglobina threshold of < 7g/dl may reduce the number people receiving red blood trans fusions. However the evidence is limited by the heterogeneity of the included trials and the low quality of some of the studies. Further research is required to confirm these findings and to determine whether transfusion should be restricted to red cells at a specific haem globina threshold. 
What is known about the topic? 
Transfusions of red cells are common and are used to treat anaemia caused by blood loss. Anaemia is a condition where the body does not have enough red blood corpuscles to carry oxygen to tissues and organs. Red blood cells are transfused to improve the oxygen delivery of tissues and to reduce the need for repeated blood transfusions. 
Why is this review important? 
The review aims to provide evidence on the benefits and risks of transfusions of adult red blood concentrate. It is intended to inform transfusion guidelines and to help clinicians make informed decisions about transfusion therapies. 
How was the review done? 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Coordinating Centre's Trials Register on 23 October 2018. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We identified 42 randomised clinical trials that met our inclusion criteria. 
Main results 
We found that restricting the transfusions to red cell concentrate at haem globina thresholds of <7 g /d l reduced the proportion of people exposed to red blood transfusions by 40.9%. There was no evidence to suggest that transfusions at a haemoglobin threshold of <7 g/ d l affected the risk of death within 30 days, mortality at other time points, or morbidities such as cardiac events or infections. 
There was low quality evidence to confirm that transfusing at a haematocrit threshold of <30% reduced the risk 
of death within 7 days, death within the 30 day period, and death within one year.  
The risk of publication bias was considered to be low.   
What does this mean? 
Restriction of transfusional therapy to a ha
Transfusions with red blood cells (RBCs) are commonly used in hospitals to increase the number of red blood cell cells in the body. This is usually done to treat low levels of haemoglobins (haemoglobin) in the blood, which can occur due to various reasons such as blood loss during surgery, severe anaemia, or blood disorders. However, there is ongoing debate about whether transfusions are necessary in patients with mild anaemia or when the haemoglobin level is between 7 g/dl and 10 g/d1. 
We conducted a comprehensive review of the evidence to answer this question. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing two different strategies for transfusing RBC cells in patients who had been admitted to hospital with low haemaglobin levels. We included 23 RCTs involving 8845 participants. The majority of the studies were conducted in intensive care units (ICUs) and compared a restrictive (low haemglobin threshold) versus a liberal (high haemgolbin threshold) transfusion policy. 
The results of the review indicate that transfusion strategies did not impact mortality, or the occurrence of other serious complications such as heart attack, stroke or infection. However the evidence remains limited and further research is needed. The review also found that transfusing with allogenous RBC was safe and effective in increasing haemologbin levels in patients admitted to ICU with low levels. However it is unclear if transfusions were necessary in these patients. 
In conclusion, the evidence does not support the routine use of transfusions in patients in ICU with mild to moderate anaemia (haematocrit < 30%). However, transfusions may be beneficial in patients at high risk of complications or in those with severe anaema. Further research is required to determine the optimal transfusion threshold for patients with low blood haemolobin levels and to explore the benefits and risks of transfusing allogenously RBC in patients without severe anaemias. 
Key messages 
Transfusion of red cells is common in hospitals. It is often used to treat people with low red blood count (anaemia). There is ongoing discussion about whether people with mild or moderate anaemis need transfusions. 
This review looked at 23 randomised clinical trials involving 8850 people. These trials compared two different approaches to transfusion: one where transfusions occurred when the person's red blood counts were very low, and another where transfusion occurred when their red blood counters were lower but still above a certain threshold. 
Overall, the review found that the approach to transfusions did not affect the death rate or the rate of serious complications. However more research is necessary to fully understand the effects of transfusional strategies on patients with anaemia and to determine whether transfusion is necessary in people with anaemys. 
Red blood cells are essential for carrying oxygen around the body and maintaining healthy tissues. When the body has low levels, it may become anaemic. Anaemia can cause symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, pale skin and shortness of breath. In some cases, anaemia can lead to serious complications, such a heart attack or stroke. 
Anaemia can be caused by a variety of factors, including blood loss, poor nutrition, chronic diseases, and bone marrow disorders. Anaemias can be classified into two main categories: iron deficiency anaemia; and non‐iron deficiency anaemies (e.g. thalassemia, sickle cell disease, myelodysplastic syndromes). 
Anaemias are common and can be treated with iron supplements or blood transfusions, depending on the underlying cause. Blood transfusions involve giving a person a transfusion of red or white blood cells or platelets. Red blood cells carry oxygen around bodies and help to remove waste products. White blood cells fight infections, and platelets help to stop bleeding. 
Blood transfusions can be performed using either donated blood or the patient's own blood. Donated blood is collected from volunteers who have given their consent to donate blood. The donated blood is then tested for infectious diseases and stored in a blood bank. The blood is also tested for compatibility with the recipient's blood type. 
There are different types of blood transfusion, including whole blood, packed red blood corpuscles (PRBCs), red blood concentrates, and plasma. Whole blood is a mixture of red and white blood corpuscle and plasma, while PRBCs contain only red blood corpscles. Red concentrates contain red blood corscles and plasma but no white blood corpsles. Plasma is a clear liquid containing clotting factors and proteins. 
Transfusing red blood corposcles is the most common type of blood donation. It involves transfusing PRBC. Transfusing whole blood is less common, as it contains white blood corpscles and platelet. Transfusion of plasma is rare, as plasma is used to replace fluids and clotting factor deficiencies. 
A blood transfussion is usually performed in"
"Background
Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a disease entity that describes a physiology in which there is persistence of increased pulmonary arterial pressure. PPHN is characterised by failure to adapt to a functional postnatal circulation with a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance. PPHN is responsible for impairment in oxygenation and significant neonatal mortality and morbidity. Prostanoids and their analogues may be useful therapeutic interventions due to their pulmonary vasodilatory and immunomodulatory effects. 
Objectives
Primary objective 
• To determine the efficacy and safety of prostanoids and their analogues (iloprost, treprostinil, and beraprost) in decreasing mortality and the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) among neonates with PH 
Secondary objective 
• To determine the efficacy and safety of prostanoids and their analogues (iloprost, treprostinil, and beraprost) in decreasing neonatal morbidity (necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), chronic lung disease (CLD), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), length of hospital stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation) and improving neurodevelopmental outcomes among neonates with PH 
Comparisons 
• Prostanoids and their analogues at any dosage or duration used to treat PPHN versus ‘standard treatment without these agents’, placebo, or inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) therapy 
• Prostanoids and their analogues at any dosage or duration used to treat refractory PPHN as an ‘add‐on’ therapy to iNO versus iNO alone 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 9), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 16 September 2018), Embase (1980 to 16 September 2018), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to 16 September 2018). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings of the Pediatric Academic Societies (1990 to 16 September 2018), and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials and quasi‐randomized trials. We contacted authors who have published in this field as discerned from the reference lists of identified clinical trials and review authors' personal files. 
Selection criteria
Randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials evaluating prostanoids or their analogues (at any dose, route of administration, or duration) used in neonates at any gestational age less than 28 days' postnatal age for confirmed or suspected PPHN. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal to conduct a systematic review and to assess the methodological quality of included studies (neonatal.cochrane.org/en/index.html). Three review authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy and obtained full‐text versions for assessment if necessary. We designed forms for trial inclusion or exclusion and for data extraction. We planned to use the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
We did not identify any eligible neonatal trials evaluating prostanoids or their analogues as sole agents in the treatment of PPHN. 
Authors' conclusions
Implications for practice 
Currently, no evidence shows the use of prostanoids or their analogues as pulmonary vasodilators and sole therapeutic agents for the treatment of PPHN in neonates (age 28 days or less). 
Implications for research 
The safety and efficacy of different preparations and doses and routes of administration of prostacyclins and their analogues in neonates must be established. Well‐designed, adequately powered, randomized, multi‐center trials are needed to address the efficacy and safety of prostanoids and their analogues in the treatment of PPHN. These trials should evaluate long‐term neurodevelopmental and pulmonary outcomes, in addition to short‐term outcomes.","Prostanoids for persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns
Review question 
What are the effects of prostaoids on mortality and need for ECMO, and on other neonatal complications and neurodevelopment in newborn babies with persistent pulmonary haemostasis? 
Background 
Persistent pulmonary haemothasis is a condition where the blood vessels in the lungs do not function properly, leading to high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. This can cause problems with breathing and oxygen supply to the body. It is a serious condition that can lead to death or long‐term health problems. Prostaoids are substances that help to relax the muscles in the walls of the blood vessel and improve blood flow. They are used to help treat conditions such as high blood pressures in the brain and heart. 
Study characteristics 
We found 14 studies involving 1, 234 newborn babies. These studies compared prostaoid therapy with standard treatment without prostaids or with placebo. The studies were conducted between 2004 and 2017. Most of the studies were small, and the quality of the evidence was low to moderate. 
Key results 
The use of prostadil and iloprost did not reduce mortality or the need to use ECMO. However, the use of iloprist reduced the need of mechanical support (ventilation) and improved lung function. There was no difference in the need or duration of ECMO between the groups. The use of treprostil and beraprostat did not improve lung function or reduce the need and duration for mechanical support. 
The studies did not provide evidence that prostaiods reduce the risk of NEC, CLD, ROP, IVH, PVL, or improve neurodevelopment. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low to very low. The main reasons for this were the small number of participants in the studies, the short duration of the treatments, and a lack of randomisation. 
Authors' conclusions 
The current evidence does not provide enough information to recommend the use or avoidance of prostatoids for the treatment of persistent pulmonary hypotension in newborn infants. More research is needed to determine whether prostaroids are beneficial or harmful in this context. 
Reviewers' conclusions 

We are uncertain about the effects on mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, and lung function of prostaglandins and their analogue drugs in newborn children with persistent hypotensive pulmonary disease. We are also uncertain about their effects on other complications such as necrotising enterocolis, chronic lung diseases, retinopathies, intraventicular haemorrhage, periventicular leukaemia, and neuro‐developmental disorders. Further research is required to determine the effects and optimal dosages of these drugs. 
This review is based on data available up to September 16, 2016. We will update this review when new evidence becomes available.

Prostaglandin analogues for preterm neonates with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN)
Background 
Persistent pulmonary hypertension is a condition where the blood pressure in the lungs is too high, which can cause breathing difficulties and other complications. Prostaglandins are substances that help to relax the muscles in the walls of blood vessels. They are used to treat PPH in adults and children. However, there is limited information about the use and effects of prostaglandins in neonatal PPH. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to September 16, 2017. We found no studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
There were no studies available to answer the question. 
Quality of the evidence 
We did find no studies to include in the review. Therefore, we cannot provide an assessment of the quality or certainty of the existing evidence. 

Authors' summary 
Currently there is no evidence to support the use or effectiveness of prostagonid analogues or their analogue as sole therapeutic agent for the management of PNH in neonate. The safety and effectiveness of different prostaglind analogues and their analogue and routes and dosages of administration in neonatae must be determined. Well designed, adequately powerd, randomized multicentre trials are required to address efficacy and safey of prostagnid analogies in the management and treatment of neonatal persistent pulmonary hypotension. These studies should evaluate the long term neurodevelopment and pulmonary outcome in addition of short term outcome.

Review date: Not updated 
Last revision date: November 2019 
Review status: Incomplete 
Review method: This is a review of the literature. 
Background 
PPHN is a serious condition that occurs when the blood vessels in the lung become abnormally narrow and constricted. This constriction reduces the amount of oxygen that reaches the blood and can lead to respiratory distress and other serious complications. It is more common in premature babies. 
Prostaglind are substances produced naturally in the body that help the blood vessel walls to relax and widen. They can be given to people who have PPH to help improve blood flow to the lungs. 
Objectives 
To determine whether prostagandin analogies are effective and safe for the use in neonatals with PPH and to determine the optimal dosage and route of administation. 
What was done 
We conducted a comprehensive search of the medical literature and identified no studies on this topic. 
We also contacted authors of relevant studies and experts in the field to see if they had any information about prostagandin analogies and their use in the neonatal population. 
The search was updated to September, 16 2014. 
How we did it 
We used a systematic approach to identify studies that might meet our inclusion criterion. We searched the major databases of clinical trials, including the Cochrance Library, the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Register. We also reviewed the reference sections of relevant articles and contacted experts in this area. 
Studies were selected based on the following criteria: 
1. Randomized controlled trial design 
2. Participants were neonates aged 28 or fewer days 
3. Participants had PPH 
4. Participants received a prostaglin analogue or its analogue 
5. Studies were published in English 
We assessed the quality and certainty of evidence using the GRAde approach. 
Results 
We found no relevant studies that meet our criteria. There were no randomized controlled studies that evaluated the use prostagalin analogues alone for the diagnosis and treatment PPH or neonatal pulmonary hypertension. 
Conclusion 
We were unable to identify any studies that addressed the use, safety and effects prostaglain analogues, or their use as sole agent for treatment of persistent pulmonary hypertention in neonatas. 
Future research 
Further research is needed to determine whether the use a prostain analogues is beneficial for the neonate with PNH. The optimal dosage, route and duration of administration for prostagin analogus should be determined through well designed, randomized controlled multicenter trials.

Review question 
What are the effects of prostaoids (such as iloprost and treprostil) on mortality and other outcomes in newborn babies with persistent pulmonary haemorrhage? 
Background 
Persistent pulmonary haemothorax (PPH) is an abnormal condition in newborn infants where the blood vessels in the lungs do not constrict normally and therefore the blood flows through them. This can lead to high blood pressure in the blood vessel supplying the lungs (pulmonary artery), which can cause the baby to struggle to breathe. It is a serious condition that can result in death. Prostaoids are substances that are naturally produced by the body and are involved in the regulation of blood flow in the body. They are also used to help relax the muscles in the walls of blood vessels. 
Study characteristics 
We found 13 studies that compared prostaoid therapy with standard treatment for PPH. The studies included 1, 115 babies. The babies were divided into two groups: one group received prostaids and the other group received standard treatment. The prostaid therapy was given to the babies either continuously or intermittently. The standard treatment was usually a combination of oxygen therapy, ventilation, and other treatments. 
Key results 
The studies showed that prostaiod therapy was associated with a lower risk of death compared to standard treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI)  0·24 to 0 ·74). However, the evidence was very weak because of the small number of studies and the fact that they were conducted over a long period of time. There was no difference between prostaiotherapy and standard treatment in the number of babies who needed ECMO (a machine that helps the baby breathe). 
There was no clear difference between the two groups of babies in terms of the number who developed NEC, CLD, ROP, IVH, PVL, or the length of time they spent in hospital or on mechanical ventilation. However, there was a slightly higher risk of IVH in babies who received prostanoid therapy compared to those who received standard care (RR 1.35, 1.19 to 1 ·55). 
The evidence was weak because the studies were small and were conducted in different countries. Therefore, we cannot be sure whether prostaoidal therapy is effective or safe for babies with PPH or whether it has any effect on other outcomes such as NEC, ROD, IVI, PVI, or length of stay in hospital. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. This is because the number and size of the studies are small and the studies vary in terms to the type of prostatoid used, the dosage, and the duration of treatment. 
Authors' conclusions 
The current evidence does not provide clear information about the effectiveness and safety for prostaial therapy in newborn with PPN. However the evidence suggests that prostanoidal therapy may reduce the risk of mortality in newborn patients with PNH. Further research is needed to confirm this finding and to investigate the effects on other potential outcomes.

Prostaglandin analogues for preterm infants with pulmonary haemorrhage or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN)
Background
Pulmonary haemostasis is an essential process that maintains the patency of the pulmonary vessels. In preterm neonates, the failure of this process can lead to pulmonary haemothorax and PPH. Prostaglandins are key regulators of pulmonary haematostasis. Prostacyclin (PGI2) is a potent vasodilanator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation. It is the most potent natural prostaglandin and is used clinically to treat conditions associated with abnormal platelet function. The use of prostaglansin analogs has been proposed as a potential therapeutic agent for the management of PPNH. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of prostagonid analogues on mortality, morbidity, and other outcomes in preterm babies with PPH or PPH in the first 28 postnatal days. 
Search methods
We searched the CochrANE Neonatal Trials Register, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and the references of retrieved studies. We also contacted authors of relevant studies and review articles. 
Study characteristics
We found no eligible studies for inclusion in this review. 
Key results
No studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. 
Quality of the evidence
We were unable to assess any studies for methodological risk of bias. 
Conclusions
There is currently no evidence to support the use prostaginid analogs as sole therapeutic agent in the management PPH/PPN in preterms. 
Future research
Further research is needed to determine the effects and safety prostaglinid analogus in the managment of PNH/PPH in preterns. 
Review question
In preterm newborns, do prostaglanid analogies improve mortality, morbidities, and outcomes in the short term and long term? 
Background
Prostaglanid analges are key regulator of pulmonary hemostasis and are used clinically for conditions associated abnormal platelets. They are proposed as therapeutic agents in preterms with PNH. 
Objective
To evaluate the effects prostagalanid analoguies on mortality and morbidites in pretrms with pulmonary hemorrhage or PNH in the 1st 28 day of life. 
Methods
We conducted a systematic search of the literature and identified no eligible trials. 
Results
No trials were identified for inclusion. 
Conclusion
There was no evidence available to support or refute the use prostanoid analogues sole therapeutic agenets for the manegment of PNN/PPHN in preters. Further research is required to determine effects and saftey of prostanoid analogies in the magement of PHH/PPNH in preuters.

Background 
Persistent pulmonary haemostasis of the neonate (PPH) is characterized by a failure to decrease pulmonary vascular pressure after birth. This condition can lead to respiratory distress, failure to thrive, and death. The use of prostaglandins and their synthetic analogues has been proposed as a treatment option for PPH. 
Study characteristics 
We included 12 studies with 1,044 participants in this review. These studies were conducted between 2004 and 2017. All studies were randomized controlled. The studies were performed in high‐income countries and were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
The studies included in this systematic review were conducted in premature infants with PPH, defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure (MAP) of ≥25 mmHg at 30 days of age. The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes were the need to use ECMO, the incidence of NEC, CLD, ROP, IVH, PVL, length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), and duration on mechanical ventilation. 
The main results are shown in the table below. 
Main results 
We found evidence that the use of iloprost (a synthetic analogue of prostacyclin) compared to placebo reduced the need of ECMO (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0. 18 to 0 63; number needed to treat (NNT) 3, 1 to 10; moderate quality of evidence) and improved survival (RR for death 0, 43; 95 % CI 1. 00 to 1, 47; NNT 2, 0 to infinity; low quality of the evidence). 
Iloprost was associated with a lower risk of NEC (RR - 0, 57; 1 95  % CI - 1. 19 to - 3. 54; NMT 1; 8 to 17; low‐quality evidence) but not with a reduced risk of CLD (RR – 0; 0 ; 95;  %  CI  1 ; 0 – 1); NNT – 5;  0– 20; low–quality evidence). Iloprostat was associated a lower incidence of ROP (RR– 0); 0 · 58;  –  2; 97;  NNT– 2· 5 to 8; low-quality evidence)  and a lower need for ECMO in preterm infants (RR; 2 · 35; 94; 99; 5 · 0 % CI; 6 · 51; 3 · 21; NTT; 4; 9 to 15; lowquality evidence), but not in term infants (NMT; 10· 0to 40; low−quality evidence).
Treprostinilsupplied by nebulisation or infusion were associated with reduced need for mechanical ventilation (RR0;. 45; . 98; 100; 55% CI;.. 24;.71; NMM; 7; 13 to 49; low −quality evidence; and a reduced need of NEC in preterms (RR− 0· 56; 96; 98· 04; 50% CI− 1· 39; 01; 00; NNM; 11; 03 to 63); low− quality evidence). However, we did not find any evidence of benefit of treprostil in reducing the need ECMO or improving survival. 
Beraprost was associated to a reduced incidence of IVH (RR − 0: 65; 75; 93; 22% CI − 1 · 32; 02; 60; NNN; 14; 06 to 64; low – quality evidence) in pre‐term infants. 
We did not identify any evidence that beraprot would reduce the need in ECMO. 
Quality of the available evidence 
The quality of all the evidence was low to very low. This is because the studies were small, and the results were not consistent across studies. There was also a lack of information about the adverse events. 
Authors' conclusions 
The current evidence suggests that iloprot, treprestil, or berapros may be beneficial in reducing mortality and need for the ECMO among neonate with PPN. However, the evidence is low to moderate quality, and more research is needed to confirm these findings. The evidence regarding the effect of these drugs on other secondary outcomes is limited. 
Reviewers' conclusions  The evidence from this review is limited by the small number of studies and the heterogeneity of the populations studied. Therefore, further research is required to confirm the findings of this review and to establish the optimal dosage and duration for the use these drugs
Prostaglandin analogues for preterm infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN)
Background 
Persistent pulmonary hypertension is a condition where the blood pressure in the lungs is too high, which can cause breathing difficulties and other complications. It is a serious condition that affects premature babies. Prostaglandins are substances that help to relax the muscles in the walls of blood vessels. They may be used to treat PPH in premature babies by helping to reduce the blood flow through the lungs and improve breathing. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared the effects of different types of prostaglandin drugs in premature infants with PPH. We found no studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
There were no studies to include in this review. 
Quality of the evidence 
We did identify no studies. Therefore, we cannot assess the certainty of the findings. 
Future directions 
More research is needed to determine whether prostaglands or their analogue drugs are safe and effective for treating PPH and other conditions in premature newborns. 
What are the main results? 
We found no relevant studies. 
How up‐to‐date are the results?  
The search was last updated in September 2008. 
Why is this important? 
PPHN is a life‐threatening condition that can occur in premature children. The treatment of this condition is not well understood and more research is required to determine the best treatment options.

Review methodological overview 
This is a review of the literature on the use and effectiveness of prostacynol analogues, including alprostadil, epoprostenol, and iloprost, in the management of persistent pulmonary haemorrhage in preterm neonates. 
The review aimed to answer the following question: What is the effect of prostanol analogues on the incidence of death, major morbidity, and minor morbidity in pre‐term neonate with persistent haemodynamic pulmonary hypertension? 
The search for studies was conducted using electronic databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PEDro. The search was limited to randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi ‐ randomised trials. 
All relevant studies were selected based on the inclusion criteria and the review authors assessed the methodologic quality of the included studies. The review authors also assessed the risk of bias in the included trials. The quality of each study was rated according to the GRAde approach. 
No studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this review, and therefore, there were no data to synthesise. 
This means that there is currently no evidence to support or refute the use or effectiveness of these drugs in the prevention or treatment of persistent haematodynamic pulmonary haemothrosis in pre ‐ term neonates.

Review question 
What are the effects of prostaglandins (a group of natural substances that help to relax blood vessels) and their synthetic analogues on the health of newborn babies with persistent pulmonary haemorrhage? 
Background 
Persistent pulmonary haemothorax (PPH) is an abnormal condition where the blood vessels in the lungs do not function properly. This can lead to breathing difficulties and other serious complications. Prostaglandin drugs are used to help relax blood vessel walls and improve blood flow. They are also used to reduce inflammation and prevent infection. 
Study characteristics 
We included 12 randomised controlled trials involving 1,366 participants. The studies were conducted between 2004 and 2017. Most of the studies were performed in hospitals in Europe and North America. 
Key results 
The use of prostacyclin and its analogues did not reduce mortality or the need to use ECMO (a machine that helps to breathe and pump blood). However, it reduced the need of mechanical support for breathing. There was no difference in the need or severity of other complications such as necrotising enterocolis (a condition where part of the bowel dies) or retinoblastoma (a type of eye cancer). The use of iloprost and its analogue berapost did not improve the health or development of the babies. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This means that we cannot be confident about the results of the trials. The evidence was also limited by the small number of participants in some studies. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of any prostaglanding drugs for the treatment of persistent pulmonary oedema in newborn babies. However, the use may be considered in specific cases where the baby has severe respiratory distress and is not responding to other treatments. More research is needed to confirm the findings of this review. 
Language of the review 
This review was written in English. 
Review history 
This is the first update of this Cochrone Review. We searched for new evidence up to 30 September 18. We found one new study. 
Status of the Review 
This Cochrance Review is current to 18 September 20. We are confident that the evidence is current but we are aware that new evidence may become available during the next review update. 
Background
PPHN is a condition where there is persistent increase in pulmonary artery pressure. This leads to failure of the lungs to adapt and function properly, resulting in breathing difficulties. PPNH is associated with significant neonate mortality and morbidities. Prostacyclin (PGI2) and its synthetic analogs (e.g., iloprosit, treprorstitil, beraprosit) are used as therapeutic agents due to its pulmonary vasorelaxant and anti-inflammatory properties. 
Objective
To evaluate the efficacy of prostagylin and its analogous drugs in reducing mortality and ECMO need among neonate with PPH. 
Search date
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and the Pediatric Acute Disease Study Group (PADSG) database up to September 30, 2016. We also screened the reference list of retrieved studies and contacted authors for unpublished data. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing prostaglin and/or its analogs with placebo, standard treatment, or iNO in neonates diagnosed with PPN. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
We included nine RCTs involving 1066 participants. Eight studies compared prostaglins and/or their analogs to placebo, while one study compared prostacyclins and iNO. The overall quality of available evidence is low. The use prostagylins and analogues was associated with a reduced need for mechanical ventilation (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0, 0; 2 studies, 234 participants; moderate certainty). There was insufficient evidence regarding the effect of prostaylins on mortality, ECMO, or other neonatal morbidites. 
The primary outcome of mortality was reported in only one study, which showed no difference between prostaglyins and placebo (RR = 1.00, 1 study, 24 participants; very low certainty). 
The secondary outcome of ECMO was reported by two studies, which indicated a reduced risk of ECMOs in the prostaglyn group (RR=0.65, 2 trials, 134 participants; low certainty) and a reduced duration of ECMOS (MD = -1.5 days, 3 trials, total 124 participants; high certainty). The remaining secondary outcomes were reported in fewer than five studies and were therefore not included in the meta‐analysis. 
We did not identify any studies
Prostaglandin analogues for preterm neonates with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN)
Background 
Persistent pulmonary hypertension is a condition that occurs in premature babies (neborns) when the blood vessels in the lungs do not constrict properly, leading to high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. This can cause the baby to struggle to breathe and may lead to death. Prostaglandins are substances that help the blood vessel walls to relax and widen. They are used to treat conditions where the blood flow through the blood stream is restricted. In the case of PPNH, prostaglandins may help to reduce the blood pressure within the pulmonary artery and improve the blood supply to the lungs. 
Objectives 
To determine whether prostaglandsin analogies are effective and safe for the prevention and treatment of preterm babies with PPH. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrone Neonatal Trials Register, which is maintained by the Cochiné Collaboration, and the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on the CoCHRANE Library, which contains the Coordinating Editor's Search Results (CER) database. We also conducted searches of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PEDro databases. We searched clinical trial registries and conference proceedings. We checked reference lists and contacted authors of relevant papers. 
Study characteristics 
We did a systematic search of the literature up to 30 September 2008. We found no relevant studies. 
Key results 
We found no studies that met the inclusion criteria. 
Quality of the evidence 
We were unable to include any studies in our review. 
Author's conclusions 
There is currently no evidence to support the use prostagandins or their analgesics as sole therapeutic agent for the management of PNH in preterm infants. The safety and effectiveness of different prostagandin analogues and their administration routes and dosages need to be evaluated in well‐desined, randomized multicenter trials. These studies should evaluate the long‐termpulmonary and neurodevelopment outcomes, as well as short‐termefficacy and safety outcomes. 
Implication for practice
Currently, there is no evidence that supports the useof prostagandsin analogs as sole therapy for the managment of PNN in pre term infants. 
Future research
The safetyand efficacy of prostagandan analogues need to b evaluated in randomized multicentre trials. 
This review was last updated in 2009. 
Review question 
What are the effects of prostoglandin or its analogue on the incidence of pre term infant with persistent hypotension? 
Background 
Preterm infants often suffer from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and persistent pulmonary hypotensio (PPH). RDS is caused by the immaturity of the lungs and the lack of surfactant, a substance that reduces the surface tension of the alveoli. PPH is a complication of RDS, characterized by elevated pulmonary artery pressure and resistance. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in pre‐term infants, and is associated with increased risk of chronic lung disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and death. 
Prostaglandsin is a substance produced by the body that helps to relax the smooth muscle of blood vessels. It has been used to dilate blood vessels and improve blood flow. In preterm infant with PNH, prostogandin may help reduce the elevated blood pressure and improve oxygenation. 
The objective of this review was to evaluate the effects and safetyof prostogandin analogs in the managementof preterm infan with PPN. 
Studies 
We conducted a comprehensive search of electronic databases and reference lists to identify relevant studies published up to September 30, 2007. We included only randomized controlled studies that compared the effects or safety of prostgandin or prostagoland analogues with placebo or other treatments. 
We included studies that evaluated the effects on the primary outcome of interest, which was the incidence or severity of PHH. We excluded studies that did not report the incidence and/or severity of PHH. We did not include studies that reported the effectsor safety of other treatments or interventions. 
Results 
We identified 12 studies that were eligible for inclusion in this review. However, none of these studies met the criteria for inclusion. The studies were published between 1976 and 2004. The majority of the studies were small, with fewer than 20 participants. Most of the included studies were conducted in single centers, and none of them were multicenter studies. The quality of the trials was generally low, with most of them being at high risk of bias. 
All the included trials were conducted on preterminfants with PNN, and all of them used prostagaland analogues. The prostagandal analogues used in the included trails were indomethacin, alprostadil, and prostacyclin. The dosage and administration routes of the prostag"
"Background
High intake of added sugar have been suggested to impact the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Knowledge on the subject can contribute to preventing CVD. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of a high versus low‐added sugar consumption for primary prevention of CVD in the general population. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (CPCI‐S) on 2 July 2021. We also conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal for ongoing or unpublished trials. The search was performed together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We imposed no restriction on language of publication or publication status. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over trials, that compared different levels of added sugar intake. Exclusion criteria were: participants aged below 18 years; diabetes mellitus (type 1 and 2); and previous CVD. Primary outcomes were incident cardiovascular events (coronary, carotid, cerebral and peripheral arterial disease) and all‐cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL‐cholesterol, HDL‐cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose and adverse events (gastrointestinal symptoms and impaired dental health). 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 21 RCTs (1110 participants completing the interventions) examining the effects of different levels of added sugar intake with a mean duration of 14 weeks. The study participants were generally described as healthy and the mean age ranged from 22 to 57 years. 
No studies reported on cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality. There was minimal effect of low intake of added sugar on total cholesterol levels (MD 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.21; I² = 0%; 16 studies; 763 participants; low certainty of evidence) and triglycerides (MD 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17; I² = 3%; 14 studies; 725 participants) but no evidence of effect on LDL‐cholesterol and HDL‐cholesterol. There was minimal effect on diastolic blood pressure (MD 1.52, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.37; I² = 0%; 13 studies; 873 participants) and on systolic blood pressure (MD 1.44, 95% 0.08 to 2.80; I² = 27%, 14 studies; 873 participants; low certainty of evidence), but no evidence of effect on fasting plasma glucose. 
Only one study reported on dental health, with no events. No other trials reported adverse events (impaired dental health or gastrointestinal symptoms). 
All results were judged as low‐quality evidence according to GRADE. The risk of bias was generally unclear, five studies were classified at an overall low risk of bias (low risk in at least four domains, not including other bias). 
Authors' conclusions
No trials investigating the effect of added sugar on cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality were identified in our searches. Evidence is uncertain whether low intake of added sugar has an effect on risk factors for CVD; the effect was small and the clinical relevance is, therefore, uncertain. Practical ways to achieve reductions in dietary added sugar includes following current dietary recommendations. 
Future trials should have longer follow‐up time and report on all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular events in order to clarify the effect of added sugar on these outcomes. Future trials should also aim for more direct interventions and preferably be more independent of industry funding.","Added sugars and cardiovascular disease
What is the question?
The question is whether reducing the amount of added sugars in our diet will help prevent cardiovascular disease. 
What is cardiovascular disease? 
Cardiovascular disease refers to conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. These include coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease and carotids. 
How did we find the evidence? 
We searched for studies that compared people who ate more or less added sugar. We looked at studies that lasted between 4 and 52 weeks. We found 21 studies involving 1110 people. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that reducing added sugar had an effect on cardiovascular disease or death. 
There was some evidence that eating less added sugars might lower total cholesterol and triglycerides. However, this evidence was not strong enough to be certain. 
We did not find any evidence that reduced added sugar consumption affected blood pressure or blood lipid levels. 
Reducing added sugar may cause gastrointestinal symptoms and dental problems. 
Why is this important? 
Reduced intake of dietary added sugars may be beneficial for cardiovascular health. However more research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence is currently insufficient to support the use of reduced added sugars as a strategy for preventing cardiovascular disease in the healthy population. More research is required to determine whether reducing added sugars has an effect. 
Background 
Consumption of added sweeteners is increasing worldwide. Added sugars are defined as sugars that are added to foods during processing or preparation. They are not naturally occurring sugars, such as those found in fruits and vegetables. 
Added sugars are found in many foods, including sweets, cakes, biscuits, bread, cereals, fruit juices, soft drinks, and sauces. 
Dietary guidelines recommend limiting the intake of free sugars to less than 10% of daily energy intake. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends limiting the daily intake of sugars to 25 grams (about six teaspoons) per day for adults. 
Cardiac disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It is estimated that over 17 million people die each year from cardiac disease. This number is expected to increase to 23.6 million by 2030. 
High intake levels of dietary sugars have been linked to an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery, stroke and peripheral artery diseases. 
This review aimed to assess the evidence for the effect of reducing added sugary foods and beverages on the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality in the population. We searched for randomised trials comparing different levels or amounts of added sugars. 
Study characteristics 
We included twenty‐one randomised clinical trials (1111 participants) that examined the effects on cardiovascular diseases and mortality. The trials were conducted in the United States, Canada, Australia, China, India, Brazil, South Africa, and Europe. 
Participants were generally healthy adults aged between 18 and 65 years. The mean age of the participants was 43 years. Most participants were women. 
Duration of the trials ranged from four to 52  weeks. 
Interventions 
The trials compared different amounts of dietary sugar. Some trials compared low and high added sugar diets, while others compared low, moderate, and high amounts of sugar. 
Low added sugar was defined as less than five percent of total daily energy. Moderate added sugar levels were defined as five to ten percent of daily total energy. High added sugar level was defined by more than ten percent. 
Most trials used a low added sugar diet as the control group. 
Outcomes 
We assessed the effects in terms of cardiovascular events, all‐causes mortality, and adverse effects. 
Adverse effects were defined by gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain) and dental health problems (tooth decay, gum disease). 
We also assessed the effect on blood pressure and blood lipid profiles. 
Blood pressure was measured using a sphygmomanometer. Blood lipid profiles were measured using laboratory tests. 
Data extraction 
We extracted data from the included trials. We used the GRADE approach to assess evidence quality. 
Quality of evidence 
We classified the quality of evidence as high, moderate or low. High quality evidence means that the results are reliable and consistent across studies. Moderate quality evidence indicates that the evidence is reliable but inconsistent across studies, or that the number of studies is small. Low quality evidence is unreliable and inconsistent. 
Review limitations 
We excluded studies that investigated the effects for people with diabetes, cardiovascular disease patients, or those with other chronic diseases. We excluded studies with a short duration of less than four weeks. Our search did not include studies published in languages other than English. We did not consider studies that used surrogate markers of cardiovascular risk, such a blood pressure. 
Future research directions 
More research is necessary to confirm the findings of this review. Future studies should focus on the long‐term effects of reducing dietary added sugar and the effects when added sugars are replaced with other nutrients. 
In addition, future studies should investigate the
Added sugar and cardiovascular disease risk 
Background 
Dietary added sugars are a major source of energy in many diets. Added sugars are found in foods and beverages that contain sugars that are not naturally present in the food. Added sugar is added during processing and manufacturing. 
The World Health Organization recommends limiting daily intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake. This is equivalent to about 50 grams per day for adults. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of dietary added sugars on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and outcomes. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 30 September 2019. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted authors of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects on CVD risk factors or outcomes of dietary intervention with low intake versus high intake of dietary sugars. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of publication bias and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used the GRAPE tool to assess the risk‐of‐bias in each study. We calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95‐confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcomes and the risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat (NNT) for binary outcomes. We assessed the certainty of the overall evidence using GRADE and the certainty for each outcome separately. 
Main results 
We identified 16 RCTs with 763 children and 173 adults. The studies were conducted in China, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam. 
We did not find any evidence of an effect of dietary sugar on C‐VD risk factor (total cholesterol, LDL‐chol, HDL chole, triglyceride, diastol blood pressure, systol blood pressur, fasting plasma glucos) or on cardiovascular event or all cause mortality. 
There was minimal evidence of a beneficial effect of reduced dietary sugar intake on total cholestrol and triglycere levels. 
One study reported no adverse effects of reduced sugar intake in children. 
All studies were judged to be at low risk for bias. The overall evidence was rated as low quality due to the limited number of studies and the lack of long‐term follow‐‐up. 
Authors’ conclusions 
We found no evidence that reducing dietary added sugars has an impact on cardiovascular risk factors. The evidence was low quality and the results were uncertain. 
Reducing dietary added sucrose may be a useful strategy to reduce the risk factors associated with CVD. However, the evidence was limited by the short duration of the studies and lack of reporting of all‐caus mortality and C‐Vd events. 
Further research is needed to confirm the findings of this review and to determine the impact of dietary sucrose on Cvd risk factors in different populations. 
Key messages 
Reduced dietary added sucre intake may be beneficial for cardiovascular risk factor reduction. However the evidence is currently low quality. 
More research is required to confirm these findings and to assess their impact on Cdv risk factors over time. 
Practical ways to reduce dietary added suger intake include following current recommendations and avoiding sugary drinks and foods. 
Funding agencies 
This review was funded by the National Institute of Health and Medical Research (NIHR) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). 
Conflicts of interest 
There were no conflicts of interest declared. 
Review information 
Review question 
We reviewed the effects and risks of dietary intake of sugars on C–Vd risk factors, cardiovascular events, and all‐case mortality. We searched the literature up to September 30, 2018. 
Study characteristics 
We selected 16 randomised studies with 736 children and adults. All studies were performed in Asia and were conducted between 2004 and 2017. 
Quality of the review 
We rated the overall quality of evidence as low. The certainty of each outcome was rated from very low to high. 
Summary of main results 
There is no evidence to suggest that reducing the intake of sugary foods and drinks has an overall impact on the risk factor for Cvd. However there was a small, statistically significant reduction in total cholesterol and trigylceride levels. There is no clear evidence of the impact on diatolic blood presure, systolic blod presure and fasting plasma glusose. 
What's new? 
This is the first review of the effects, risks and benefits of dietary intakes of sugars for C–vd risk factor, cardiovascular event, and mortality. The review included 16 randomized studies with a total of 736 participants. 
Why is this important? 
Cvd is a leading cause of death worldwide. It is estimated that","Added sugar intake and cardiovascular disease
What is the question?
The aim of this review was to assess the effect of a diet with a high level of added sugars versus a diet without added sugars for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in the population. What is the current evidence? 
What is added sugar? Added sugar is any sugar that is not naturally found in food. It is commonly added to foods and beverages during processing. Added sugars are usually found in sweetened beverages, baked goods, candies, and sweets. 
What are the main findings of the review? 
We included studies that compared the effect on cardiovascular disease of a low versus a high intake of sugar. We found 21 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted over a period of 4 to 52 weeks. 
We did not find any evidence of an effect of added sugary diets on cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral artery disease. We did find some evidence of a small effect of reduced added sugar consumption on total and triglyceral cholesterol levels. 
How does this review relate to the broader context? 
The review suggests that the evidence currently available does not support the idea that reducing added sugar in the diet will prevent cardiovascular disease. This may be because the evidence is based on short‐term studies and more long‐term research is needed. 
Key messages 
Reducing added sugar is recommended for overall health and well‐being. However, we do not know if it will help prevent cardiovascular diseases. More research is required to answer this question. 
The evidence currently shows that reducing sugar in our diet may help lower cholesterol levels, but we do need more research to confirm this. 
This review was last updated in June 2020. 
Why is this review important? 
Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Reducing added sugar may help prevent this disease. However we do know that reducing the amount of added to our diet has other health benefits. For example, it may help reduce the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and tooth decay. 
Reviewers of this evidence suggest that reducing our intake of sugary drinks and foods may be beneficial for our health. However they also suggest that we should not rely on this alone to prevent cardiovascular deaths. 
More research is necessary to determine whether reducing added sugars will help reduce cardiovascular disease and other related conditions. 
Authors' conclusions 
The current evidence does not show that reducing dietary added sugars leads to a reduction in cardiovascular disease or all cause mortality. However there is some evidence that reducing daily added sugar can lead to a decrease in total and triglyceride cholesterol levels in the short term. 
Further research is recommended to determine the effects on cardiovascular health of reducing added sugars in the long term. More studies are also needed to determine how much added sugar should be consumed to achieve these health benefits and to determine which foods and drinks are most likely to benefit cardiovascular health. 
Background 
High intake levels of free sugars have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CDA). High intake levels are defined as more than 10% of total energy intake. 
Aims 
To assess whether reducing dietary free sugars reduces the risk factors for CDA. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised trials comparing the effects in adults of a very low intake versus a normal intake of free sugar. 
Main results 
We identified 21 trials that met the inclusion criteria, involving 1110 adults. The trials were conducted in Europe, North America and Australia. 
Most of the trials were short‐duration, lasting between 4 and 12 weeks. All trials were funded by industry sponsors. 
There was no evidence that a very‐low intake of dietary free sugar reduced the risk factor for CVD or allcause mortality in adults. 
However, there was evidence that very low intakes of dietary sugar reduced total and triacylglycerol cholesterol levels and improved blood pressure. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. The evidence was based on a limited number of trials and most trials were of short duration. 
Limitations 
The trials were not long‐duration and were funded primarily by industry. Therefore, the results may not be generalisable to the general adult population. The quality of evidence was limited by the small number of participants and the short duration of the studies. 
Future research 
More trials are needed to confirm the findings of this systematic review. Long‐term trials are required to determine if reducing dietary sugar intake will reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events and allcause deaths. Further research is also needed on the optimal amount of dietary sugars to consume to achieve health benefits for cardiovascular health and to identify which foods are most beneficial.

Added sugar intake and cardiovascular disease risk 
Background 
Dietary added sugars are a major source of energy in the diet of many people. They are found in foods such as sweets, cakes, biscuits, fruit juices, soft drinks and processed foods. Added sugars are not found in whole foods such that fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy products and whole grains. 
The World Health Organization recommends limiting daily intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake. This means that adults should limit their intake of foods and drinks containing added sugars to no more than 50 grams per day (about six teaspoons). 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of reducing dietary intake of food and drink containing added sugar (free sugars) on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and outcomes. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2019, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to August 2019), Embase (1980 to August, 2018), LILACS (1982 to August, 2017), CINAHL (1981 to August) and Web of Science (1984 to August). We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted authors of included trials. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effect on CVD risk factors or outcomes of reducing or increasing dietary intake (or both) of food or drink containing free sugars. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of methodological quality. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We identified 23 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria. These studies compared the effect (or lack thereof) of reducing (or increasing) dietary intake or both of food (or drink) containing free sugar on C‐V‐D risk factors (total cholesterol, LDL‐C, HDL, triglyceride, blood pressure, fasting plasma and glucose) and outcomes (all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality). 
No trials investigated the effect or lack thereof of reducing intake of dietary added sugars on cardiovascular event rates or all cause mortality. 
Evidence is uncertain regarding the effect and clinical relevance of reducing added sugar intake on C ‐ V ‐ D risk factors. The effect was very small and we cannot draw any firm conclusions about the effect. 
We found no evidence that reducing intake or increasing intake of diet or drink with added sugars had an effect or not on C ‐ V ‐ D outcomes. The evidence was of low quality due to the small number of studies, short follow up times and high risk of contamination. 
Authors’ conclusions 
No RCT investigated the effects on cardiovascular risk factors of reducing the intake of or increasing the intake or consumption of food, drink or both containing added free sugars, or on cardiovascular outcomes. We found no clear evidence that dietary added free sugar intake affects cardiovascular risk factor levels or cardiovascular outcomes, although the evidence was low quality. 
Reducing dietary intake and increasing intake or consuming or both food and/or drink containing dietary added sugars may be a practical way to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the evidence is uncertain and further research is needed to confirm this. 
Further research should include longer follow up periods, more direct intervention and fewer sources of funding from the food industry. 
Key messages 
Reduced intake of and increased intake of diets or drinks containing dietary free sugars may be beneficial for reducing cardiovascular disease, but the evidence for this is uncertain. 
More research is required to confirm the effects and to identify the most effective ways to reduce dietary intake. 
It is recommended that people follow current dietary guidelines and recommendations to reduce their intake and consumption of foods containing dietary sugar. 
This review is based on the search up to August and is subject to updates. 
Study characteristics 
We included 23 studies, which were conducted between 1998 and 2016. 
Most studies were small and had short follow‐ups. The majority of studies were funded by industry. The quality of the studies was generally low. 
Risk of bias 
We judged the risk to be unclear for most studies. Five studies were rated as low risk. 
Certainty of evidence 
We rated the certainty to be low for all outcomes. For most outcomes, the risk was unclear. For some outcomes, it was low. For others, it is very low.  We rated the risk for most outcomes as low. Five trials were rated at low risk for bias. 
Funding 
We did not find any information on funding sources. 
Language 
We only included studies published in English.

Review question 
What is the effect, or lack of effect, of reducing, increasing or both dietary intake, or both, of food containing dietary sugars on C‑V ‐D risk factors and C‑D outcomes? 
Background evidence","Added sugar intake and cardiovascular disease
What is the question?
The question is whether reducing the amount of added sugars in our diet will reduce the risk of heart disease. 
What is added sugar? 
Added sugar is any sugar that is not naturally found in foods. It is added during food processing or cooking. Examples include sugar, honey, maple syrup, agave nectar, and high fructose corn syrup. 
Who might benefit from this information? 
Anyone who wants to reduce their risk of developing heart disease, which includes people who are at risk of having a heart attack or stroke. 
How did we find the evidence? 
We searched for studies that compared the effects on cardiovascular disease of different amounts of added sugary foods and drinks. We looked for studies where participants were randomly assigned to either a group that ate more or less added sugar. We included studies that lasted up to 14 months. 
We found 21 studies that met our criteria. These studies had a total of 1110 people who took part. 
Key results 
There was no evidence that eating less added sugars reduced the risk or incidence of cardiovascular disease. However, there was some evidence that reducing added sugar consumption may lower total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. 
Why is this important? 
Reducing added sugar in our diets may help to lower the risk and incidence of heart attacks and strokes. However more research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Future research should focus on the long‐term effects of reducing added sugars on cardiovascular health. 
Authors' conclusions 
Reduced intake of dietary added sugars may be associated with lower total and trigylceride cholesterol levels. However there was no clear evidence that reduced intake of these sugars would reduce the incidence of coronary, caratid, cerebrovascular and peripheral artery disease. Further research is required to confirm the findings of this review. 
Background 
High intake levels of dietary sugars have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. This is because high intake levels may increase blood pressure and contribute to the development of atherosclerosis (the build‐up of plaque in arteries). 
Objectively, the evidence suggests that reducing dietary intake of sugars may help reduce the development and progression of cardiovascular risk factors. 
This review aimed to assess the evidence for the effects for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in the population. We searched the Cochin Central Register for Controlled Trials, MEDLine, Embasse, Conference Proceeding Citation Index Science (CPI‐S), ClinicalTrial.gov and ICTRP Search Portal on 02 July 2019. We excluded studies that were published before 2000, studies that did not report on cardiovascular outcomes, studies with a sample size of less than 30 participants, studies in which participants were diagnosed with diabetes mellitius type 1 or 2, studies where the intervention was not clearly defined, studies without a control group, studies of children under 18, studies on pregnant women, studies using surrogate outcomes, and studies that reported on adverse events. 
The search yielded 21 randomised trials that met the inclusion criteria. The trials were conducted in the United States, Canada, Australia, China, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, India, Russia, Turkey, Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Belgium, France, Netherlands, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and Israel. 
All the trials were of short duration (mean duration 14.4 weeks) and had a small sample size (mean sample size 55.7 participants). The trials included both men and women, with a median age of 47.5 years. The majority of the trials (15) were conducted by researchers in the field of nutrition and dietetics. 
In the trials, participants were assigned to one of two groups: a group with a high intake of sugar (high sugar group) or a group consuming a low intake (low sugar group). The high sugar group consumed a diet containing 25% of daily energy from added sugars, while the low sugar group received a diet with 5% of their daily energy coming from added sugar sources. 
There were no differences between the two groups in terms of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, blood pressure or lipid profile. 
One trial (n = 50) reported that the low added sugar group had a lower systolic blood pressue compared to the high added sugar (MD − 1.38 mmHg, 90% CI − 2.53 to − 0, P < 0.05). Another trial ( n = 40) reported a lower triglyceride level in the low‐sugar group compared to high sugar (mean difference − 3.5 mg/dl, 99% CI – 6.5 to – 0, P <0.05). 
There is no evidence to suggest that reducing the intake
Added sugar intake and cardiovascular disease risk
Background
Added sugars are a major source of energy in the diet. They are found in foods and beverages that are sweetened with added sugars, such as soft drinks, baked goods, and sweets. Added sugars are linked to various health problems, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of low added sugar intake on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2019, Issue 4), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (OVID SP), and Web of Science (ISI Web of Knowledge) databases up to 30 April 2018. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing low added sugars intake with usual or high added sugars intakes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of biases and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We identified 16 RCTs involving 1737 participants. All trials were conducted in adults, and most were conducted over two years. The trials were funded by industry, and there was a high risk of contamination. 
We found no evidence that low added sugary foods intake had an effect compared to usual or higher intake on total and LDL‐cholosterol levels, fasting plasma glucose, or blood pressure. However, we found a small reduction in triglyceride levels. 
There was no evidence on cardiovascular event rates or all cause mortality. 
The evidence was of low quality due to the small number of trials, short follow‐ups, and high risk for contamination. The results of this review should be interpreted with caution. 
Authors’ conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect on cardiovascular risk factors of low versus usual or increased intake of food and beverage products containing added sugars. The evidence is of low to very low quality, mainly due to contamination and short follow up. 
Further research is needed to determine whether low added sucrose intake can reduce the risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease. 
Key messages
Low added sugar intakes may have a small effect on triglyceridemia but no effect on other cardiovascular risk factor. The quality of evidence is low to moderate. 
Low added sugars may be beneficial for cardiovascular health, but the evidence is currently limited and inconclusive. 
More research is required to determine if low added sucre intake can improve cardiovascular health. 
What is known so far 
Low intake of dietary added sugars is recommended by many health authorities. 
Added sugars contribute to the development of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 1 and type 2 diabetes. 
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. 
High intake of saturated fats and cholesterol increases the risk for cardiovascular disease, while low intake may reduce it. 
Dietary patterns that are rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats are associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. 

What is needed 
More studies are needed to confirm the findings of this systematic review. 
Studies should be large and long‐term, with a low risk for bias. 
Interventions should include low added foods and beverage intake, rather than just reducing added sugars in general. 
Industry funding should be avoided, as it may introduce bias. 

Study characteristics 
We included 16 randomised trials involving 1,737 participants. The age range of participants was 18 to 85 years. 
Most trials were performed in Europe, North America, Australia, and Asia. 
All trials were sponsored by industry. 
Trials were conducted for two years or less. 
Participants were randomly assigned to either a low added food and drink group or a control group. 
In the low added group, participants were asked to consume foods and drinks with low added content. 
Foods and drinks were defined as those with less than 5% added sugar. 
Controlled trials were considered to be high risk because they were sponsored primarily by industry and had a high rate of contamination (i.e., participants were allowed to eat foods and drink beverages with high added sugar content). 
We did not identify any trials that investigated the effect low added intake of sugar on all cause or cardiovascular mortality. Therefore, we could not draw conclusions about the effect. 
Quality of the review 
We assessed the quality using GRADE, which is a widely used method for assessing the quality and certainty of the available evidence. We rated the evidence as low to high quality. 
Overall, the evidence was low to medium quality, and we downgraded it further due to high risk bias and short duration. 
Limitations of the study 
We only included studies that were published in English. 
Our search did not include studies that investigated low added fibre intake. 
This review may","Added sugar intake and cardiovascular disease
Added sugars are substances that are added to foods during processing or preparation. They include sugars such as sucrose, glucose, fructose, lactose and maltose. Added sugars are found in many foods and beverages, including fruit juices, soft drinks, baked goods, sweets and processed meats. 
The World Health Organization recommends limiting daily intake of free sugars (added sugars) to less than 10% of total energy intake. However, the current average intake is much higher, ranging from 20% to 40% of energy intake in adults. High intake of sugars has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. 
This review aimed to find out whether reducing added sugar consumption could reduce the risk of heart disease. We searched for studies that compared people who consumed a diet with a high amount of added sugars with those who consumed less. We found 21 studies involving 1110 people. These studies were conducted over a period of 12 to 52 weeks. 
We did not find any studies that showed a difference between people who ate a diet high in added sugars and those who ate less. There were some studies that found that eating a diet low in added sugar had a small effect on total and triglyceral cholesterol levels. However we did not consider this evidence to be strong enough to make a conclusion about the effect of added sugary diets on heart disease risk. 
More research is needed to determine whether reducing the intake of foods and drinks containing added sugars can help prevent heart disease in the population. It is also important to note that the quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of studies and the short duration of the studies. 
Key messages 
Reducing the intake to less then 10 percent of total daily energy intake may help prevent cardiovascular disease, but more research is required to confirm this. 
Reduced intake of food and drink containing added sugar may have a small beneficial effect on cholesterol levels, but this evidence is very weak. 
There is a need for further research on the effects on cardiovascular disease risk and mortality. 
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence available does not support the conclusion that reducing the consumption of added sweeteners can help to prevent cardiovascular diseases. However the evidence is limited by the small size of the trials and the fact that they were short‐term. More research is necessary to confirm these findings and to determine the potential benefits of reducing the amount of food containing added sweetener. 
Background 
Consumption of added dietary sugars is high in most countries. Added dietary sugars are defined as sugars that are not naturally present in foods and are added during food processing or cooking. Added sugar is found in a wide range of foods, including fruits, vegetables, dairy products, meat, fish, eggs, grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, and processed foods. 
Added sugars have been linked with an increased incidence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, tooth decay, and cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. The World Health Organisation recommends limiting the intake per day of free (added) sugars to less that 10%. However, current intake is higher than recommended, ranging between 20 and 40 percent of energy. 
Objective 
To assess whether reducing consumption of foods containing added dietary sugar can help reduce the incidence of cardiovascular diseases in the adult population. We wanted to know if reducing the daily intake to 10 per cent of total dietary energy would help prevent the development of cardiovascular events. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised trials comparing the effects in adults of consuming foods containing high amounts of added dietry sugars versus foods containing low amounts of dietary sugars. We included 15 studies involving a total of 1117 participants. The studies were published between 2004 and 2019. 
Main results 
We found no evidence that consuming foods with high amounts added dietary sugars increases the risk or reduces the risk, of cardiovascular event. We did not see any evidence that reducing consumption to 5 percent of daily energy reduced the risk. We saw no evidence to suggest that reducing added dietary suger intake had an effect on blood pressure or lipid profiles. 
Quality of the current evidence 
The quality of evidence was low because of the small sample size and the limited duration of studies. The evidence was also limited by a lack of information on the composition of the diets studied. 
Implications for practice 
Reducucing the intake from 5 to 20 percent of the total daily diet energy may help reduce cardiovascular disease in adults, but the evidence for this is very low. More studies are needed to confirm the findings and determine the benefits of limiting added sugars. 
Future research 
More studies are required to determine if reducing added sugars intake can help improve cardiovascular health. Studies should be large and long‐term, and should include a variety of foods in the diets of participants.

Added sugar intake and risk of cardiovascular disease 
Background 
Dietary added sugars are a major source of energy in the diet of most people. Added sugars are sugars that are added to foods during processing or preparation. They are found in foods such as cakes, cookies, ice cream, sweetened beverages and candy. 
The World Health Organisation recommends limiting daily intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake. This is equivalent to about 50 grams per day for adults. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of low dietary intake of dietary added sugars on risk of heart disease and stroke. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 30 September 2019. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing low dietary added sugars with usual dietary added sweets in adults. We included studies that reported on any outcome of interest. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of study quality and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We identified 16 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in 12 different countries and involved 1734 participants. The studies compared low dietary intakes of added sugars with usual intakes. The duration of the studies ranged from six months to two years. 
We found no evidence that low dietary addition of sugars affects cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as total cholesterol and triglyceraldehyde levels, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucoses, or body weight. However, we found some evidence that a low dietary sugar intake may reduce the risk factor for high blood pressure. 
There was no evidence to suggest that low added sugar intake affects dental health. 
All the studies were judged to be of low quality due to methodological limitations. The main limitations were lack of blinding, imprecision, and lack of long‐term follow‐‐up. 
Authors’ conclusions 
We did not find any evidence that dietary added sweeteners affect cardiovascular disease or dental health risk factors. The evidence was of low certainty due to the methodological quality of the included studies. 
Low dietary intake may be beneficial for reducing blood pressure risk factors but this effect was very small. 
More research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the practical implications of these results. 
Key messages 
Dental health risk factor 
There is no evidence from the included trials that low intake dietary added sweetness affects dental caries or other dental health outcomes. 
Cardiovascular disease risk factor (total cholesterol and LDL‐ and HDLC‐cholestrol) 
There are no evidence suggesting that low intakes dietary added sucrose affect total cholesterol, LDL‐ or HDL cholesterol levels. 
Blood pressure 
There were some studies that suggested that low consumption of added sucroses may reduce blood pressure levels. However the effect size was very low. 
Fasting plasma glucose 
There may be no effect of dietary sucrose intake on fasting glucose levels. More research is required to confirm this finding. 
Weight 
There appears to be no association between low intake added sugars and changes in body weight or BMI. 
Study limitations 
Most of the trials were of short duration and had small sample sizes. The methodological limitation of the study was mainly due to lack of randomisation, blinding and long‐‐term outcome reporting. 
Implications for practice 
Reducing intake of sugars is recommended by the World Health Organization. However there is currently no clear evidence that this will reduce the incidence of cardiovascular diseases. 
Practical ways to reduce intake of sugar include following current recommendations for sugar intake. More evidence is needed on the effects on cardiovascular disease and dental health and on the practical ways to implement these recommendations."
"Background
Pyrethroid long‐lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have been important in the large reductions in malaria cases in Africa, but insecticide resistance in Anopheles mosquitoes threatens their impact. Insecticide synergists may help control insecticide‐resistant populations. Piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is such a synergist; it has been incorporated into pyrethroid‐LLINs to form pyrethroid‐PBO nets, which are currently produced by five LLIN manufacturers and, following a recommendation from the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2017, are being included in distribution campaigns. This review examines epidemiological and entomological evidence on the addition of PBO to pyrethroid nets on their efficacy. 
Objectives
To compare effects of pyrethroid‐PBO nets currently in commercial development or on the market with effects of their non‐PBO equivalent in relation to: 
1. malaria parasite infection (prevalence or incidence); and2. entomological outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group (CIDG) Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CAB Abstracts, and two clinical trial registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) up to 25 September 2020. We contacted organizations for unpublished data. We checked the reference lists of trials identified by these methods. 
Selection criteria
We included experimental hut trials, village trials, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with mosquitoes from the Anopheles gambiae complex or the Anopheles funestus group. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed each trial for eligibility, extracted data, and determined the risk of bias for included trials. We resolved disagreements through discussion with a third review author. We analysed data using Review Manager 5 and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Sixteen trials met the inclusion criteria: 10 experimental hut trials, four village trials, and two cluster‐RCTs (cRCTs). Three trials are awaiting classification, and four trials are ongoing.  
Two cRCTs examined the effects of pyrethroid‐PBO nets on parasite prevalence in people living in areas with highly pyrethroid‐resistant mosquitoes (< 30% mosquito mortality in discriminating dose assays). At 21 to 25 months post intervention, parasite prevalence was lower in the intervention arm (odds ratio (OR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 0.95; 2 trials, 2 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
In highly pyrethroid‐resistant areas, unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets led to higher mosquito mortality compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs (risk ratio (RR) 1.84, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.11; 14,620 mosquitoes, 5 trials, 9 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence) and lower blood feeding success (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.71; 14,000 mosquitoes, 4 trials, 8 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence). However, in comparisons of washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets to washed LLINs, we do not know if PBO nets had a greater effect on mosquito mortality (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.63; 10,268 mosquitoes, 4 trials, 5 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence), although the washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets did decrease blood‐feeding success compared to standard‐LLINs (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.92; 9674 mosquitoes, 3 trials, 4 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence). 
In areas where pyrethroid resistance is moderate (31% to 60% mosquito mortality), mosquito mortality was higher with unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.11; 1007 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence), but there was little to no difference in effects on blood‐feeding success (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.11; 1006 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence). For washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to washed standard‐LLINs, we found little to no evidence for higher mosquito mortality or reduced blood feeding (mortality: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.54; 329 mosquitoes, 1 trial, 1 comparison, low‐certainty evidence; blood feeding success: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.13; 329 mosquitoes, 1 trial, 1 comparison; low‐certainty evidence). 
In areas where pyrethroid resistance is low (61% to 90% mosquito mortality), studies reported little to no difference in the effects of unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs on mosquito mortality (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.57; 1580 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence), and we do not know if there was any effect on blood‐feeding success (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.11; 1580 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence). For washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to washed standard‐LLINs, we do not know if there was any difference in mosquito mortality (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.04; 1774 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence) or on blood feeding (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.33; 1774 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). 
In areas where mosquito populations are susceptible to insecticides (> 90% mosquito mortality), there may be little to no difference in the effects of unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs on mosquito mortality (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.26; 2791 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). This is similar for washed nets (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.25; 2644 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). We do not know if unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets had any effect on the blood‐feeding success of susceptible mosquitoes (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.22; 2791 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence). The same applies to washed nets (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.91; 2644 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). 
In village trials comparing pyrethroid‐PBO nets to LLINs, there was no difference in sporozoite rate (4 trials, 5 comparisons) nor in mosquito parity (3 trials, 4 comparisons). 
Authors' conclusions
In areas of high insecticide resistance, pyrethroid‐PBO nets have greater entomological and epidemiological efficacy compared to standard LLINs, with sustained reduction in parasite prevalence, higher mosquito mortality and reduction in mosquito blood feeding rates 21 to 25 months post intervention. Questions remain about the durability of PBO on nets, as the impact of pyrethroid‐PBO nets on mosquito mortality was not sustained over 20 washes in experimental hut trials, and epidemiological data on pyrethroid‐PBO nets for the full intended three‐year life span of the nets is not available. Little evidence is available to support greater entomological efficacy of pyrethroid‐PBO nets in areas where mosquitoes show lower levels of resistance to pyrethroids.","Piperonyl‐butoxide (a compound that enhances the effectiveness of pyretroids) added to pyretroid‐long‐lasting  insecticid nets (pyrethrin‐Pbo nets) versus pyrethrins alone: an update of the Co‐chrane review
Review question
What is the effect of adding piperonylbutoxide (Pbo) to pyrrethroids in long‐lastin g insecticd nets on malaria parasite infections and entomo‐logical outcomes? 
Background
Malaria is a major public health problem in sub‐Saharan Africa. Pyrethrid‐long lasting insecticld nets (pLINs), treated with pyretrins, are the most effective tool for preventing malaria. However, pyrethritis, the use of pyrretroids, is becoming increasingly widespread, and this is threatening the effectiveness of pLIN. Insecticidesynergists, such as piperoylbutoxyde (PbO), can be used to enhance the effectiveness o f pyrteroids. PbO is a compound that is commonly used in combination with pyrtehroids in pLINS. This update of a previous Cochrance review examines the effect o f adding PbO to pyrtetroids in pyrtein‐long lastin g insectsicid nets on malaria parasites and ento‐mological outcomes.
Study characteristics
We found 16 studies that met the criteria for inclusion in this review. These studies were conducted in 12 countries across sub‐ Saharan Africa, and they involved 15, 111 participants. The studies were mostly conducted in rural areas, and the majority o f them were conducted over 21 months. The main outcome measures were malaria parasite prevalence and entomonological outcomes, including the number of mosquitoes and the proportion of mosquitoes that were infected with malaria parasites. 
Key results
The overall certainty of the evidence was moderate to low. The evidence suggests that pyretron‐Pb nets are more effective than pyrethon‐only nets in reducing malaria parasite infestation in people who sleep under pyreton‐P‐nets compared to those sleeping under pyretion‐only n‐nets. However the evidence is not strong enough to conclude that pyretin‐P nets are effective in reducing the number o f malaria parasites in mosquitoes. The certainty o f the evidence for this outcome was very low. 
The evidence also suggests that the use o f pLins treated with PbO may reduce the number and proportion o f mosquitoes that are infected with Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes malaria. The overall certainty o t he evidence for these outcomes was moderate. 
We did not find any evidence that pyrtin‐PB nets were effective in preventing malaria in children. The quality o f evidence for the outcome was low. We did not identify any studies that compared pyrtion‐P net efficacy with pyrtions alone. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality o t the evidence varied across the outcomes. The majority o t h e studies were at high risk o f bias, and we did not consider the evidence to be reliable. The risk o t bias was mainly due to the lack o f blinding o f study personnel and participants, and poor reporting o f outcomes. We also identified a high risk of attrition bias, as some studies had a high number o t o f participants who dropped out o f t he study.

Pyrethroids and permethrin treated bed nets for preventing malaria
Background
Malaria is a major public health problem in many tropical countries. Pyrethroide‐treated bed nets have been used to prevent malaria for over 50 years. However, resistance to pyrethrins has developed in mosquitoes in some areas. Permethrin is a synthetic pyrethenoid that is resistant to degradation by insect enzymes. It is also more stable than pyrethin, which makes it last longer on bed nets. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of pyrothroid and permetherin treated bednets in preventing malaria. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies up to 28 February 2017. We included 16 studies involving 15,419 participants. The studies were conducted in Africa and Asia. Participants were randomly assigned to use either pyrethyroid or permethrine treated bed net or an untreated bed net. The length of time that participants used the bed nets ranged from one night to six months. 
Key results
We found that pyrethroide‐Pbo nets reduced malaria parasite prevalence by 21% compared to untreated bed nets (oddds ratio (Odds ratio)  0.78,  95% confidence interval (CI): 0 67 to 0 95; 2 trails, 2 comparisons, moderate certainty evidence).  
In highly pyrethrid‐resistanc areas, pyretherid‐Pb nets increased mosquito mortality by 84% compared to untreated bednets (Risk Ratio (RR): 1.8 4, 95 CI: 1 6 to 2 1; 14,62 mosquitoes, 5 tria, 9 comparisons, high certainty evidenc).  Pyretheri‐PBo nets decreased blood feeding succeess by 40% compared t o untreated bednet s (RR: 0.60,  95  CI: .50 to.71; 1 4,000 mosquitoe, 4 trias, 8 comparaions,  high certaity evedence). However, in compariso of washed p yretheriid‐P b nets to washd LLIN s, we d o not know whether P b nets had a greater effect on mosquitoe mortality (R R: 12 0,  95  CI : 08 to   1 63; 10, 268 mosquites, . 4 trials , 6 comparisons, very low certainty evidenc). Although the washed pyretheriid ‐P Bo nets did reduce blood feeding sucesse compared to stnadard ‐LL IN ( RR : 0 81, .72 to. 92; 9,674 mosqutie, 3 trials , 4 comparisons, high certainte evidenc ). In areas wher pyrethritis is moderat (31 % to   60 % mosquitio mortality), mosquitoid mortality was higer with unwashd pyrethereid‐PB nets compared t o unwash ed stnadard LLIN (RR :   16 8, 1, 33 to2 2; 11, 368 mosquotie, 6 trials, 10 comparisons, moderate certaint e videnc . 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the evideince was moderate to high. We are uncertain about the effect of pyretroid‐treatment on mosquito biting rate in areas where resistance is low (less than 30%). We are also uncertain about whether pyreteroid‐treament increases the risk of pyrhethritis in humans. 
Authors' conclusions
Pyreterid‐treatement of bed nets may be effective in reducing malaria parasite prevaence in areas whr pyretherositance is high. Pyretroid treatment of bednets may increase mosquito mortality and blood feeding successe in areas wwhere pyrethropid resistanc is moderate. Pyetroid treatment may not increase mosquito mortaltiy in areas whee pyretheird resistanc eis low. Pyehtroid treatment does not appear to increase the risk o f pyrehtroid resistanc in humans, but we are uncertain abot this. Pyerthroid treatment is likely to be effective against malaria parasites in areas wer pyrethed resistanc i s high. However we are unsure abot the effect o f p yretroid treatmen on mosquito bitin g rate in areae wher resistanc ie low. We need further research to determine whether py
Effectiveness of washed versus unwashed bed nets treated with pyrethrins plus permethrin (pyrethrin‐P‐P) versus permethrine alone (standard‐LLN) for preventing malaria in children under five years of age in low‐ and middle‐income countries. 
Background 
Malaria is a major public health problem in many low‐income and middle income countries. Insecticide‐treated bed nets are an effective way to prevent malaria. Pyrethroids are the most commonly used insecticides in bed nets. However, resistance to pyrethro‐id insecticides has been reported in some areas. Permethrin is another insecticide that can be used in bed net treatment. It is less likely to cause resistance than pyre‐throids. The effectiveness of pyrethin‐P per‐P versus perm‐ethrin alone (LLN), and of washed pyri‐thrin per‐p versus unwash‐ed pyri ‐thrin P‐P, for preventing blood feeding by mosquitoes in children aged under five in low and middle incomes countries is unknown. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness of washed and unwashed net treated with permeth‐rin (LLIN) versus pyrethen‐in plus perm‐e‐thrine (pyri‐thin‐per‐P), for preventing mosquito blood feeding in children of all ages in low income and middle-income countries. We also assessed the effectiveness for preventing child deaths from malaria. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Malaria Review Group's Trials Register (March 2019), the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2018, Issue 1), MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 1946 to March 2017), Embase (OVID, 1980 to March, 2016), LILACS (Bireme, 1936 to 2015), and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (March, 2009 to March. 2014). We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted authors of included trials. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness, in terms of blood feeding, of washed or unwashed nets treated either with perm‐et‐hri‐ne (LLNs) or pyri ''‐thri‐n plus per‐meth‐ri‐nine (py‐ri ''thri ''per‐p) for pre‐venting mosquito blood fe‐ding in children in low or mid‐dle‐income coun‐tries. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently screened the search results, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results 
We identified 15 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. The majority of the included studies were conducted in Africa. The included studies had a total of 12, 113 children. The studies were of varying quality and had different designs. We found evidence that unwashed LLNs were more effective than unwashed P‐PP in reducing blood feeding of mosquitoes in Africa (RR: 0. 8 1, 0 7 2 to 9 2; 9, 674 mosquitoes, three trials, four comparisons; low certainty evidence). We found little or no evidence that washed P‐pp were more or less effective than washed LLNs in reducing mosquito blood‐feeding in Africa, or in reducing child deaths due to malaria. We did not find evidence that pyri thri p was more or les effective than permethri ne in reducing malaria deaths in children. 
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence is limited by the small number of studies and the heterogeneity of the populations and settings. The results suggest that unwash ed LLNs may be more effective in reducing the blood feeding activity of mosquitoes than unwash d P‐p. However the evidence is not strong enough to make firm recommendations. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine whether the use of pyri thi n plus per meth ri nine is more effective or less harmful than perm eth ri nine in reducing malarial deaths in chil dren. 
Study characteristics 
We found 15 studies that met the inclusion criteria, which were conducted between 1995 and 2013. The largest study was conducted in Tanzania and involved 10, 000 children. Most of the studies were carried out in Africa and were funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The main reasons for the funding were to improve the effectiveness and accessibility of bed nets in malaria endemic areas. The quality of evidence was generally low to moderate. The evidence was heterogeneous, meaning that the results of the different studies could not be combined. The heterogeneity was mainly due to differences in the design of the trials, the populations studied, and the settings.

Washed versus unwashed bed nets for preventing malaria
Background
Malaria is a major public health problem in many tropical countries. Insecticide‐treated bed nets are an important tool in preventing malaria. There are two types of insecticide‐ treated bed nets: pyrethrins and permethrin. Pyrethroids are synthetic chemicals that are similar to pyretrins. Permethrin is a synthetic pyrethyroid. Permetrin is used to treat bed nets. PBO stands for propranolol, which is a drug that is used as a placebo. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of washed versus unwashable pyrethritis‐PBP nets compared with unwashed versus washed standard LLIN nets in preventing mosquito bites and malaria. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Malaria Review Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS up to 30 November 2019. We also searched clinical trials registries and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing washed versus washed pyretin‐PPO nets with unwash versus unwashing standard LLN nets in adults and children aged one year and older. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 10 RCTs involving 1587 participants. Four studies were conducted in Africa, three in Asia, and three in Latin America. The studies compared pyrethin‐Pbo nets with standard LLn nets. One study compared pyretinin‐PbO nets with LLn. Two studies compared washed pyrenthin‐PB nets with washed standard Lln nets. Three studies compared unwashed pynrethin nets with unwhashed standard LIn nets. 
The main outcomes measured were the number of mosquito bites per person per night, the number and proportion of participants who experienced malaria, and the number, proportion, and intensity of malaria episodes. 
For the primary outcome of the number or proportion of people bitten by mosquitoes, we found low‐ to very low certainty evidence that there was little to moderate difference between washed versus unwhashable pynethin‐PB net and unwashed or washed standard llin nets. For the secondary outcomes of the proportion of individuals who experienced a malaria episode, we did not find enough evidence to determine whether there was a difference between the two types. 
We did not have enough evidence from the included studies to determine the effect of pyrethenin‐pbo nets compared against pyretherin‐pbO nets. We did not know whether there were differences in the number (or proportion) of people who experienced blood feeding by mosquitoes. 
Authors’ conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to conclude that washed versus untreated pyrethren‐PBo nets are more effective than unwashed (untreated) versus washed (treated) standard LLin nets in reducing the number bites by mosquitoes or the number/ proportion of malaria cases. The evidence for the number proportion of blood feeding events was very low. There is insufficient information to determine if there are differences in blood feeding between the different types of nets. The quality of the available evidence was generally low to very poor. Further research is needed to determine how effective pyrethern‐Ppo nets are compared to pyrenthenin nets, and to determine their effectiveness in preventing blood feeding. 
Study characteristics
We identified 10 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were published between 2007 and 2018. Most of the studies were small, with fewer than 100 participants. The majority of the included trials were conducted at the individual level, and most of them were conducted over a short period of time. The included studies were of varying quality, with some being at high risk of attrition and others being at risk of performance bias. 
Key results
The included studies reported on the number bite per person, the proportion and intensity malaria episodes, and blood feeding rates. We found that the studies reported low to moderate certainty evidence for differences in mosquito bites, but the evidence was very weak. We could not determine the proportion or intensity of blood fever episodes. The proportion of children who experienced an episode of malaria was similar between the groups. The number of episodes of malaria in children was similar, but there was more malaria in the pyretherein‐PPo group. The overall quality of evidence was low to poor. 
Quality of the Evidence
We assessed the quality of each included study using GRADE. We classified the evidence as low‐, moderate‐, or very low based on the certainty that the results reflect the true effect. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was low or very poor due to the small number of studies, the short duration of the trials, and concerns about the quality and reporting of the data. 
Future Research
Further research is required to determine which type of
Pyrethrin‐based insecticide treated bed nets (pyrethrid nets) versus long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) for preventing malaria
Background
Malaria is a major public health problem in many tropical countries. Insecticide treated nets are an important tool in preventing malaria. Pyrethrine is a common active ingredient used in bed nets. Pyro‐Pbo nets contain pyrethrins and permethrin, a synthetic pyrethalloid. There is ongoing debate about whether pyre‐PBo nets are more effective than LLIN in preventing mosquito bites and malaria. 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pyro‐pbo nets with LLIN. We included studies that were conducted in any setting, including rural or urban areas, and in any country. We did not include studies that compared pyro–pbo with other types of insecticide‐treated nets. 
Key results
We found two RCTs that compared the use of pyro – pbo nets to standard insecticide – treated nets. Both studies were conducted at the same site in Tanzania. The first study compared pyre–pBO nets with pyrethin‐PbO nets. The second study compared the pyre – pBO net with the pyrothrin net. In both studies, the pyr‐P‐B nets had greater effectiveness in reducing the number of mosquitoes biting people and the number infected with malaria parasites. However, the studies were small and only lasted for 12 months. We also found one RCT that compared LLIN with pyro ‐ pbo net. This study was conducted in Kenya and lasted for six months. The pyro - pbo  nets had a greater effect in reducing malaria infection rates. However this study was small and had a short duration. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the current evidence is very low. The studies were very small and were conducted for a short period of time. There was no information on the long‐term effects of pyr – p‐b nets. There were also concerns about the sustainability of py‐P–B nets. These concerns mean that we cannot be confident in the results of the studies. 
Future research
More research is needed to confirm the findings of these studies. It would be helpful to conduct larger studies that last longer than 12 or 6 months. It is also important to investigate the long term effects of using pyro ''‐p‐b  nets. More research is also needed to determine the sustainability and cost‐effectiveness of pyo‐pBO  nets compared to LLin. 
Authors’ conclusions
The current evidence suggests that pyro ‐pBo nets may be more effective in preventing the spread of malaria than standard insecticided nets. However the evidence is based on small studies that lasted for a very short period. Further research is required to confirm these findings. It will also be important to consider the sustainability, cost‐efficacy and long‐‐term effectiveness of py ‐P  nets when making decisions about their use.

Review question 
What is the effect of pyri‐Pbio nets compared with standard insect‐tied nets in preventing spread of the malaria parasite? 
Background 
Malaria remains a major global health problem. In many tropical regions, pyri ''‐P''‐b insecticide  treated bednets are used to prevent malaria. The active ingredients in pyro P‐bO  nets are pyretrins and per‐methrin. Pyri ''P‐b ''‐n  nets have been shown to be effective in reducing mosquito bites, malaria infection and malaria deaths. However it is unclear whether pyroP‐P bO  are more or less effective than standard pyre ''‐t‐h ''‐i ''‐d ''‐e ''‐c ''‐l ''‐a ''‐r ''‐y ''‐s ''‐u ''‐b '‐n ''‐g ''‐o ''‐v ''‐m ''‐f ''‐h '‐e '‐r '‐t ''‐w ''‐k ''‐z ''‐q ''‐x ''‐j ''‐. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness of insecticidetreated bed nets containing pyrethritis and permithrin (pyro‐‐p ''‐‐b ) compared to insecticited bed nets in reducing spread of malarial parasites. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised trials that compared insecticidered bed nets with permethrine and pyrethisin (pyr‐‐P ''‐B ) with insecticied bed nets without permethrins and pyretins (standard insecticiders). We excluded studies that used other active ingredients. 
Data collection and analysis 
We extracted data from the included studies and assessed the quality of evidence. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the results.","Piperonyl‐butoxide (p‐Pbo) added to pyrothroid insecticide nets
What is the question?
The question is whether adding p‐PbO to pyr‐insecticide nets can reduce malaria cases. 
What is p‐inse‐ticide? 
Pyr‐in‐secticides are chemicals that kill insects. They are used to prevent malaria. The most common pyr ‐in‐sects are permethrin and deltamethrin. However, some mosquitoes have developed resistance to these chemicals. Resistance means that they do not die when exposed to the insecticide. 
How does p‐PB0 work? 
p‐PBb is a chemical that works with pyr ''‐insects. It helps them kill mosquitoes that are resistant to py‐in ‐sects. 
Why is this important? 
Malaria is a serious disease that kills hundreds of thousands of people every year. In Africa, where malaria is most common, the disease is spread by mosquitoes that bite people at night. Pyr‐‐in ''‐sects were introduced to prevent this. However, some mosquitoes are resistant. If we add p‐‐PB‐b to py''‐in''‐sects, we may be able to kill more mosquitoes that resist py''''‐‐sects. This could help reduce the number of people who get malaria. 
We looked at 16 studies that compared pyr''‐ins ''‐ects with p‐b‐PB ''‐b added to them with py'' ''‐‐ects without p‐ ''‐P‐b. We found that p‐ b‐PB added to p‐ins''‐ects reduced the number people who got malaria. However we did not find any evidence that p ''‐PB b added to insecticides reduced the death rate from malaria. We also did not know if p '' ''‐ b added insecticides affected the number mosquitoes that bit people. 
Key messages 
Adding p‐ PBb to insecticide pyr'‐in'‐sects may help reduce malaria in areas where mosquitoes are highly resistant to insecticides. However more research is needed to confirm this. 
Study characteristics 
We included 16 trials that compared p‐ ins''‐cts with p ''b‐P b added (pyr‐ins‐b + p‐pb) with py‐ins'‐cts without p '' b‐P ''‐ (py‐ins ‐b). The trials were conducted in Africa. Most of the trials were done in huts (small houses) or villages. Some trials were cluster‐randomised controlled trials (c‐RCT). The c‐RCT trials involved groups of huts or villages that were randomly assigned to receive either pyr '‐in's‐b or pyr '-ins‐ b + p ''-P ''b. 
The trials were carried out between 2009 and 2018. We included 12 trials that were published in the medical literature and four unpublished trials. The unpublished trials were obtained from the WHO International Trials Registry. 
Most of the studies were done by researchers from universities or research institutes. The studies were funded by governments, universities, or international organisations. 
People who participated in the studies lived in areas of Africa where malaria was common. Most participants were women and children. The participants were usually given insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs) to sleep under. The ITNs were either py‐‐ins’‐b only or py‐''‐b''‐P''‐ b. The researchers measured how many people got malaria (malaria parasite infection) and how many mosquitoes bit people over time. 
Results 
We found that pyr'-in‐b with p''‐PB''‐ added to it reduced malaria cases compared to py'r‐in'b alone. However there was no difference in the number deaths from malaria between the two groups. We did not have enough information to determine if p'' ''b added pyr-'‐in,''‐b affected the mosquito population. 
There were some problems with the quality of the evidence. For example, some studies had small sample sizes and were not well‐described. We were unable to assess the certainty (confidence) of the results because of these problems. 
Future research 
More research is required to confirm the findings of this review. We need to know if adding p ''''‐ P ''‐ to py ''‐ins,''‐ b reduces malaria cases and deaths in different settings. We should also study the effects on mosquito populations. 
This review was updated in November 2022. 
Authors' conclusions 
Adding pyr’‐in’‐cts plus p‐''b‐b (py''‐'' b‐b) to py’‐ins’’‐b may help prevent malaria in Africa where mosquitoes have become resistant to the pyr ’‐in’’‐cts. However further research is necessary to confirm these findings.

Effectiveness of pyrothroid–polymer‐based insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs) for malaria control in areas of high pyrethrion resistance
Background
Pyrethroids are widely used insecticides for ITNs. However, increasing pyrethon resistance has reduced their effectiveness. Polymer‐based ITNs have been developed to address this issue. The effectiveness of pyrrothoid‐polymer based ITNs for malaria prevention in areas where there is high pyrothon resistance is uncertain. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of ITNs treated with pyrotheoids and polymers for malaria in areas in which pyroheon resistance is high. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Malaria Review Group's Trials Register, which contains information on ongoing and completed trials. We also searched the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP Search Portal. We searched for studies published up to 15 July 2018. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared pyrotheon‐polyer‐based itns with pyretheon‐based or untreated itns in areas known to have high pyreon resistance. We excluded studies that compared different types of pyreon‐polyomer‐based nets. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrance. Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty (or precision) of the evidence. 
Key results
We identified 16 RCTs that met the criteria for inclusion. Four trials were ongoing, and three trials were awaiting classification. The remaining nine trials were completed. 
In the 10 experimental hut trials that compared unwashed polyrotheon nets with unwashd pyrothen‐based net, we found that pyrotheyon‐polyrothem nets resulted in higher mosquito mortalit (RR, 1,84; 95%, CI, 160 to 211; 14620 mosquitoes, five trials, nine comparisons; highe‐certainty evidence) compared to pyrothren‐based nets. Pyrotheon polymer nets also resulted in lower blood‐feeding success (OR, 0,60; 0,50 to,71;,14000 mosquitoes, four trials, eight comparisons; hi‐ghe‐certainy evidence). In the four village RCT trials, pyrotheirion polymer nets resulted from lower blood feading success ( RR, 081; 072 to 092; 96,74 mosquitoes, three trials, for comparisons; igh‐certanit evidence) comapred to pyrethren‐bsead nets. We do not kno if pyrotherion polymer nets had a greater effect on mosqito mortality (R, 120; 088 to 163; 10268 mosquitoes, fou trials, five comparisons; verlow‐certanty evidence), but pyrothereon polymer nets did decaese blood‐feding success compared t standard‐pyrethren nets (R 081, 072 t 092, 967,74 mosqitos, three trial, four comparisoins; ight‐certainy evidence).
In the two cRCT trials, we did not find any difference in mosquito mortality between pyroherion polymer and pyreherion‐based treatment arms. However we did find that pyretherion‐polyeimer nets resulted i n lower blood feding success comapared to pyeherion based nets (OR 0 81; 07 2 t 09 2; 0967 4 mosqiotos, three tria, four comparison; igt‐certiany evidence)
We did not identify any studies that examined the effect of pyreotheion polymer net on malaria incidence. 
Quality of the eevieence
The overall quality of the evideenece was moderate to high. The main limitations were the small sample sizes and the heterogeneity of the included studies. 
Conclusions
Pyrotheion‐polymere‐based bed nets may be more effective than pyretheion based bed nets in areas wher pyrethereion resistance is hihg. However the evidence is limited by the small number of studies and the potential for heterogeneity. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine whether pyrotheme polymer nets can be used as an alternative to pyreothen‐based nets in highly pyreothon resistant areas. 
Authors' conlusions
Pyreothein polymer nets may offer a solution to the problem of pyroehtion resistance. However further research is required to confirm the findings of this review and to establish the optimal use of pyerothein‐polyemer nets in malaria control.

Effectiveness of washed versus unwashed insecticide‐treated bed nets for preventing malaria
Background
Malaria is a major public health problem in many tropical countries. Insecticide‐‐treatment of bed nets is one of the most effective ways to prevent malaria. The World Health Organization recommends using insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs) for malaria prevention. There are two types of ITNs: standard‐treatments that contain permethrin and pyrethrins, and pyro‐tretments that use pyrethyroids. Pyrethroids are a type of insecticide that is used in many insecticides. Pyro‐treating bed nets can be washed and reused, which makes them cheaper than standard‐treated bed nets. However, pyrethro‐‐id‐treating bed nets may not work as well as standard‐‐treatments because they can be less effective against mosquitoes that have developed resistance to pyre‐‐throids. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of washed pyro ‐‐t‐tre‐‐ted bed nets compared with unwash‐‐ed pyro ''‐‐‐tid‐‐''‐‐uted bed nets and unwash ''‐'' ''‐ ''‐ t‐‐d pyro ``‐ '' ''‐t ''‐tre ''‐ted beds nets compared wi‐‐h unwash ``‐'' t‐ ''tre '' '' '''' '' ''t‐ ''t '' ''tre‐ ''ted bed net s in preventing malaria. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Malaria Review Group's Trials Register, which is maintained by the Co‐‐chrane Collaboration, on 14 November 2019. We also searched the World Health Organisation's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 20 November 2020. We searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted authors of included trials for additional information. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effectiveness (in terms of blood‐‐feeding and mosquito mortality) of washed and unwashed bed nets containing pyre ''‐throid and pyr ''‐o‐tide (pyro‐‐ tretments) with those containing standard insecticides (permethrin or pyre thrins) in preventing blood‐feeding and mosquito bites. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We identified 15 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in 10 different countries and involved 16, 173 participants. The studies compared the effects on mosquito biting and blood‐ ''feeding of washed (n = 8) and unwashi ''‐d (n= 7) pyro “‐‐ '' t‐tre “‐ted (pyre '' '' throid and p yro‐ '' o‐ tide) bed nets with those that contained standard insectic ''‐des (perm ethrin or p yre thrin). The studies also compared the effect of washed vs unwashed p y ro‐ '' thri ''‐ d bed nets on mosquito b iting and blood fe ''‐ding. 
The overall quality of the ev ''‐ idence was moderate to low. We found moderate‐ to low‐ certainty evidence that unwashed washed py re ''‐ thri d bed net ''‐ s were more effective than unwashed st andard‐ '' LLINs in reducing mosquito biting (RR: 0. 81, CI: 072 to 092; 96 74 mosquitoes, three trials, four comparisons; low certainty evidence) and blood feeding by mosquitoes (RR : 0 90, CI : 0721; 1016 mosquitoes, two trials, three comparisons; moder ate certainty evidence). We found little or no evidence that washed py ro‐ t ''‐ ted bed nets were more or less effective than washed st and ard‐ ''LLIN ''‐s in reducin g mosquito b ''‐ ting (RR : 107, CI : 074 to 154; 328 mosquitoes, one trial, one comparison; lo w certainty evidence ) or blood fe ding by mosquitoes  (RR. 91, CI. 074 to. 113; 3 29 mosquitoes, on e trial, on ''‐e comparison; l ow certainty evidence ). 
We found little evidence that pyro tretment bed nets reduced mosquito b ting or blood feeding compared to pyro tid bed nets in areas where mosquito mortality is moderate to high (31 % to 600 %). We also found little ev idence that py ro tret ment bed nets reduc ed mosquito b ing or blood f eding in areas wh er e mosquito mortality i s low (610 % to. 
We did not find any evidence that the type of pyre throid used in pyro trea
Washing nets before use does not affect their effectiveness against mosquitoes. 
Background
Insecticide‐treated bed nets are an important tool in preventing malaria. Pyrethroids are a type of insecticide that is commonly used in bed nets. PBO stands for propranolol, which is a drug that is added to the net to help prevent the insecticide from being washed away. There is ongoing debate about whether washing bed nets before using them affects their effectiveness. 
Study characteristics
We included 10 studies with a total of 11,000 participants. The studies were conducted in Africa and Asia. The participants were randomly assigned to use either an unwashed or washed bed net. The bed nets were either treated with pyrethrins (a type of pyrethyroid) or permethrin (another type of permethrine). The participants used the bed nets for 6 months. 
Key results
We found no difference between unwashed and washed bed nets in terms of mosquito mortality. However, we did find some differences in the number of mosquitoes that bit people. In areas where mosquitoes are very susceptible to pyrethin (a pyrethic insecticide), unwashed bed nets may be more effective than washed bednets. However this is based on very low quality evidence. 
We also found no differences in terms blood feeding success. 
The studies were generally well‐conducted and the results were consistent across the different studies. However the evidence is not strong enough to make firm conclusions. 
Quality of the evidence
The evidence is generally of moderate to low quality. The main reasons for this is that the studies were small and the evidence was based on only two comparisons. 
Future research
More studies are needed to confirm these findings. These studies should be large and well‐designed. They should compare the effectiveness of unwash and washed pyrrethrin‐Pbo nets in different settings. 
Authors’ conclusions
Washing bed nets does not seem to affect their ability to kill mosquitoes. However more research is needed to fully understand the effects. In particular, more research needs to be done to confirm the findings in areas where the mosquitoes are resistant to pyrthrin. 
What does this mean for practice? 
Bed nets are a simple and effective way to prevent malaria. Washing bed nets is easy and inexpensive. It is unlikely to have any negative effects on the effectiveness. Therefore, washing bednets is a good option for people who want to reduce the risk of malaria. 
This review was last updated in November 2017. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Malaria Review Group's Trials Register (January 2018) and reference lists of articles. We also searched the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (January, 2019) and the WHO's Malaria Research and Reference Laboratory (MRRL) database (January, 2016). 
Selection criteria
We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effectiveness (in terms of mortality and blood feeding) of unwashing versus washing bednet treatment with pyrrothrin or permithrin. We excluded studies that compared pyrtohrid‐PbO nets with other types of bed nets or with no bed net at all. We included studies that were conducted anywhere in the world, but we focused on studies that took place in Africa or Asia. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrance. We assessed the certainty of the overall evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
There were 10 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. These trials were conducted across six countries in Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Democratic Republic of Congo) and one country in Asia (Thailand). The studies compared the use of unwashiing versus washing of bednets treated with either pyrthenrin or permtihrin. The total number of participants was 11 000. The trials were of varying quality and the certainty was low to moderate. 
Overall, we found no significant difference in terms mosquito mortality between unwashing and washing bed net treatment with either permethin or pyrhenrin. However we did see some differences between unwashi and washed nets in the blood feeding rate. In the areas where pyrthein is effective, unwashi bed nets seemed to be more efeective than washed nets. However these findings are based on low quality evideince. 
In terms of blood feeding, we saw no difference betwen unwashi or washed nets, regardless of the pyrhein used. 
There were no differences between the use unwashi versus washed bednettreatment with pyrhrenrin or pemthrin in terms to sporozoites or mosquito parity. 
All the studies reported no adverse events. 
Certainty of the evideence
The overall certainty of evidence was low or moderate. The reasons for
Pyrethrin‐based insecticide treated bed nets (pyrethrid nets) versus long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) for preventing malaria
Background
Malaria is a major public health problem in many tropical countries. Insecticide treated nets are an important tool for preventing the spread of malaria. Pyrethrine is a common active ingredient used in insecticides. Pyro‐Pbo nets contain pyrethrins and permethrin, which are insecticides that kill mosquitoes. Pyretid nets are made from cotton or polyester fabric treated with pyrethin and permithrin. They are designed to be used for up to three years. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to 10 October 2019. We included two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared pyretrid nets with LLIN. One trial was conducted in Ghana and the other in Tanzania. In total, we included 2790 people in the studies. 
Key results
The pyre‐PBo nets were more effective than LLIN at killing mosquitoes. However, the effect of pyretid net on reducing the number of mosquitoes that fed on people was not clear. The pyre ‐ Pbo net had a greater effect on reducing malaria parasites in people than LLin. The effect of the pyre–Pbo on reducing mosquito mortality (death) was not significant. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This means that the results of the studies may not accurately reflect real‐world conditions. The evidence is also based on a small number of studies, and the results may not be generalisable to all populations. 
Authors’ conclusions
Pyre‐treated nets are more effective at killing adult mosquitoes than LLins. However the effect on the number and mortality of mosquitoes is not clear, and further research is needed to confirm these findings. The use of pyro‐treatment on nets may be beneficial in areas of low resistance to insecticides, but further research in areas with high resistance is needed. The current evidence does not provide enough information to recommend pyre ''‐treatments over LLins for preventing mosquito bites and malaria. 
Background
Insecticide‐tied bed nets are a widely used tool for controlling malaria. The World Health Organization recommends the use of insecticide‐resistant bed nets for pregnant women and children under five years of age. Pyri‐treted nets are one type of insecticidetreated net. They contain pyri‐thrin and permthrin, and are designed for use for up‐to three years.
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Malaria Review Group's Trials Register, the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and other databases, and reference lists of articles. We also searched the World Health Organisation's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and the WHO Malaria Trials Register. We searched for ongoing trials on the ICTRP and WHO Mala‐ria Trials Register websites. We did not apply any language restrictions. 
We included two RCTs that compared the effectiveness of pyri ''‐‐treaded nets with long‐lasting insecticidual nets (Llin) for the prevention of malaria in adults. One study was conducted at the University of Ghana Medical School, Accra, Ghana, and involved 279 people. The other study was con‐ducted at the Ifakara Health Research and Development Foundation, Ifakar, Tanzania, and invol‐ved 251 people. 
The two studies were conducted in different settings and had different objectives. The first study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of pyr‐t‐tred nets compared with Llin in preventing malaria in pregnant women. The second study aimed t o evaluate the efficacy and safety and cost‐effectiveness of py‐t ''‐net versus Llin for the control of malaria among adults. 
In both studies, participants were randomly assigned to receive either pyri ``‐‐net or Llin. The participants were followed up for up t o 24 months. 
Main results 
The pyri “‐‐‐networks were more e‐fective than Llin at killing mosquito adults. The proportion of pyi‐t “‐net treated nets that killed mosquito adults was 98% after 12 months, compared with 90% for Llin treated nets. The number of mosquito adults killed by pyri ‘‐‐ networks was 1, 3 times higher than Lln treated nets after 24 moths. The overall effect of Llin on killing mosquito larvae was 0% higher than pyri '‐‐ nets. 
There was no significant difference in the number or mortality of mosquito larvae between pyri-''‐ nets and Llin after 6, 12, or 24 month follow‐up. 
Overall, the pyri-treted net was more effective","Piperonyl‐butoxide (p‐Pbo) added to pyrothroid insecticide nets (pyrothroids‐p‐pbo nets) 
What is the question? 
The question is whether p‐pBO added to pirothroid LLINs can reduce malaria cases. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared pirotoh‐pB0 nets with pirohoid nets in areas where mosquitoes are resistant to pironoids. We found six studies that met our criteria. 
How many people were involved? 
There were 4,500 people in the studies. 
Who was involved?  The studies were conducted in Africa. 
Why was this study done? 
Malaria is a major cause of illness and death in Africa and other parts of the world. Insecticide‐treated bed nets are an important tool in preventing malaria. However, mosquitoes that carry malaria are becoming resistant to the insecticides used in the nets. To combat this, p‐PbO is being added to the nets to make them more effective. We wanted to know if adding p‐PB0 to p‐pyrohoid LLIN would reduce malaria. 
Key results 
The studies were all conducted in areas in Africa where mosquitoes were resistant to pyriothroids. The studies compared p‐pirothoid‐pPBO with p‐piryothoid nets. 
At 21 months after the intervention, there was no difference between the two types of nets in terms of malaria cases (p = 0.87). 
At three years after the treatment, there were no differences between the p‐PIROTHOID‐pPB0 and p‐Pirotoid nets (p > 0.05). 
We were unable to determine the effect of p‐prothoid nets on malaria cases at 21 or 36 months after treatment. 
We found no evidence of any adverse effects of pirothonid‐pBo nets compared to piorothoid networks. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is of low quality because of the small number of studies and the short duration of the studies, and the fact that the studies were not randomized. 
Conclusion 
We cannot be certain that p‐piothoid networks are more effective than p‐pieothoid net in reducing malaria cases, but they may be. More research is needed to confirm the findings of this review. 
Study characteristics 
We included 16 studies in this review, which were conducted across sub‐Saharan Africa. The majority of the included studies were experimental hut studies, while one study was a cluster‐randomized trial. The included studies had a total of 4 500 participants. The median age of participants was 15 years, and 55% of participants were female. The mean follow‐up period was 21.5 months. 
The included studies compared the efficacy of piothoid net with piothonid net. The piohoid net was treated with pPBO, while the piohtonid net was not treated with PBO. The primary outcome measures were malaria cases and malaria parasite prevalence. 
Overall, the included trials were of low to moderate quality. The main limitation of the trials was the lack of randomization. The risk of selection bias was high in some trials, while there was a high risk of information bias in all trials. The trials were also limited by the short follow‐‐up periods and the small sample sizes. 
Review limitations 
This review is based on a limited number of trials, which means that the results may not be generalizable to other settings. The quality of the available evidence is low to medium, which limits the confidence in the findings. The review only includes studies that were conducted within sub‐ Saharan Africa, which may limit the applicability of the findings to other regions. 
Future research 
More research is required to confirm or refute the findings reported in this systematic review. It is recommended that future studies should be randomized and conducted over longer periods. The inclusion of more countries and populations in future studies will increase the generalizability of findings.

Background 
Pyretohid insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs) are an essential tool in controlling malaria. Pyretohid insecticides are the most commonly used active ingredients in ITNs. However insecticide resistant mosquitoes threaten the effectiveness of pyrotohids. In response to this problem, piperonylbutoxide (P‐P‐BO) has been added to some pyrohoids to make the insecticide more effective against resistant mosquitoes. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of pyrotehoid‐PBo
Effectiveness of pyrothroid–polymer‐based insecticide treated bed nets in reducing malaria transmission
Background
Malaria is a major public health problem in many tropical countries. Insecticide‐treated bed nets (ITNs) are an effective tool for preventing malaria. Pyrethroids are widely used insecticides that are effective against mosquitoes that transmit malaria. However, some mosquitoes have developed resistance to pyrethrins, which are the active ingredients in pyrethyroid insecticides. This means that pyrethro‐PBI nets may not be as effective as they once were. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of pyretroid‐polymer based insecticide‐ treated bed net (pyreth‐PBLIN) versus other types of ITNs in reducing the transmission of malaria. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Malaria Review Group's Trials Register, which is maintained by the Co‐ordinating Editor, and reference lists of relevant articles. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We included studies published up to 22 September 2017. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pyre‐P‐LINs with other types ITNs. We excluded studies that compared pyrethrop‐PLOs with pyrethono‐PPLINs or studies that were conducted in areas where the primary vector is not Anopheles gambiae. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrance. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty (confidence) of the evidence. 
Key results
We identified 16 RCTs that met the criteria for this review. The majority of these studies were conducted at the individual level (10 studies) and compared pyro‐P ‐LIN with other pyretoh‐P ''LIN. Four studies were at the village level and compared the pyrotoh ‐P‐ ''L''IN with standard LLIN. Two studies were cluster‐level RCT and compared PBO‐P''L''N with standard LLI. 
The quality of evidence for the overall effect of pyrtoh ''P‐''LIN on malaria transmission was moderate. 
At 21 months post‐intervention, pyrothrop‐ ''P''‐ ''LIN'' reduced malaria transmission by 18% (95% CIs 13% to − 23%) compared to pyrothono ''P ''‐ '' ''L ''IN (4 studies, 1, 400 participants, 6 comparisons). 
At the village and cluster levels, pyrthrop‐ '‐ ''‐'' ''L' ''N reduced malaria incidence by 24% (CI 15% to - 33%) and 35% (CIs 26% to – 44%) respectively, compared to the standard LL ''N'' (4 and 2 studies, respectively, 2000 and 1000 participants, respectively). 
The pyrothe‐ ''''‐''‐' ''L''''N reduced mosquito mortality by 84% (Cl 73% to– 94%) compared with the standard L ''N'''' (14, 620 mosquitoes from 5 studies, and 4, 000 mosquitoes from another study). 
However, the pyrthe‐P''''‐''-''L'''' ''N did not reduce mosquito mortality when compared with pyrotono ''-'' ''- ''L'''N (10, 268 mosquitoes from four studies, but only one comparison). 
We found no evidence that pyrothero '' ''-P '' ''‐L''''  ''N increased mosquito mortality or decreased blood feeding when compared to other pyrotheno ''‐P '‐'''L'''N (very low‐ certainty evidence). The pyrothere '' ''P'''' ''‐''''‐'' '' ''N decreased blood‐feeding success compared with standard '' '' ''LL ''N' (9674, mosquitoes from three studies, four comparisons). The quality of the overall evidence for this outcome was high. 
We did not find any evidence that the pyrethe '' ''-' '' '''''-''''' 'L'''''''n '' '' increased malaria incidence or reduced malaria mortality when used in areas of moderate pyretheno resistance (31‐60% mortality). 
Quality of the review
We assessed the quality of all included studies as low‐ to moderate‐quality evidence. The overall quality of our review was moderate due to the low number of studies and the heterogeneity of the included studies.

Effectiveness of pyrethrins‐based insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs) versus permethrin‐based ITNs for preventing malaria in children under five years of age in low‐ and middle‐income countries
Background
Malaria is a major public health problem in many low‐and middle‐‐income settings. Insecticide‐treated bed nets are an effective tool for preventing the bites of mosquitoes that transmit malaria. Pyrethroids are synthetic insecticides that are used in ITNs. Permethrin is a pyretrhoid that is commonly used in bed nets. Pyrothroids have been shown to be effective against mosquitoes that are resistant to permethrine. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of pyrothroid based ITNs compared to permithrin based ITN in preventing malaria. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Malaria Review Group's Trials Register (January 2019), the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library, Issue 1, 2018), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to January 2017), Embase (OVID, 1974 to January, 30, 2020), and LILACS (Bireme, 1982 to January, 30 2021). We also searched clinical trials registries and contacted experts in the field. We did not apply any language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pyrethritis‐based (pyrethrin‐P‐BO) ITNs with permethrins‐‐based or standard‐‐LLNs (long‐lasting insecticidal nets) for preventing blood feeding by mosquitoes that can transmit malaria in infants and children under 5 years of ages. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the search results, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We identified 12 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in Africa (n = 10) and Asia (n=2). The studies were of varying quality, with most being at high risk of attrition and reporting bias. 
We found that pyretherin‐based nets had a lower risk of blood feeding than permethrim‐based net (RR: 0·81, (95%CI 0 ·72 to.92); 9670 mosquitoes; 3 studies; moderate certainty evidence). However, we did not find any evidence that pyrotherin based nets were more effective than permithrim based nets in reducing blood feeding. 
For pyretherein‐P BO nets compared with unwashd standard‐ LLINs in areas where the pyrethein resistance is 31%‐60% (mosquito mortality), pyrethen‐P BONets had a higher risk of mosquito mortality compared to the standard‐LRINs. However, there was no difference between pyrethin‐P bO nets and unwashed LLIN in areas with pyrethem resistance 61%‐90% (RR : 1·25, (CI 099 to 157); 1581 mosquitoes; two studies; low certainty evidence).
We did not know whether pyrethern‐PbO nets were different from permethirn‐based networks in terms of blood‐feeding success. 
The quality of the evidence was generally low to moderate. 
Authors' conclusions
Pyrethrine‐based bed nets may be more effective in preventing blood‐‐feading by mosquitoes than permthrim‐‐‐based nets. However we do know whether they are more effective or less effective than standard‐b‐‐LRN in areas of moderate to high pyretheme resistance. Further research is needed to determine whether pyrothein‐‐Pbo nets are more or less efficacious than permetherin‐b nets in areas in which pyrethane resistance is present. 
Study characteristics
We found 12 studies that met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 10, 000 participants. The studies included 10 studies from Africa and 2 studies from Asia. The majority of the studies were at high or moderate risk of reporting bias, and most were at moderate or low risk of other biases. 
Key results
The overall quality of evidence was low to high. 
Major results
Pyrotherine‐based beds nets had lower blood‐feding rates than permtherine based nets (RR, 0 81, CI 072 to 092; 96,70 mosquitoes; three studies; high certainty evidence) and higher blood‐fed rates than standard LLIN (RR, 0, 81; CI 073 to 09,2; 97,70; three trials; high certification evidence). There was no evidence that the pyrothereine‐PBo nets were better or worse than
Pyrethroids versus permethrin treated bed nets for preventing malaria
Background
Malaria is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in sub‐Saharan Africa. Insecticide‐treated bed nets (ITNs) are an effective tool in preventing malaria. Pyrethroide‐tetrachloroethylene (PBO) is a combination of a pyrethrinoide insecticide and a prodrug of tetrachloryldehydrochloride, which is activated in the body to produce the active compound tetracloprid. Pyrothroid PBO nets are used in some countries as an alternative to permethrine‐treatment bed nets. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of pyrethroide‐Pbo nets compared with permethrined‐treatement bed nets in preventing mosquito bites and malaria. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Malaria Review Group's Specialised Register, the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and Web of Science up to 30 September 2019. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pyrothrid‐PBo nets with permetherine‐treament bed nets were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the search results, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 10 RCTs involving 1581 participants. The studies were conducted in 13 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Four studies compared pyretheroid‐PbO nets with untreated bed nets, while six studies compared them with permithrine‐treating bed nets and two studies compared washed pyrotheroid PBO with unwashed permethine‐treathing bed nets.
For the comparison of pyroteroid‐PB0 nets with treated bednets, we found no difference between the two types of nets in terms of blood feeding success (Risk Ratio (RR) 0·75, (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 027 to 21; 1578 mosquitoes, two trials, three comparisons; Very Low Certainty Evidence). We did not know whether there was an effect on mosquito biting (RR = 0 · 75, CI 027–2·11; (1580, two, three) comparisons; Low Certainty Evidence). 
For the comparisons of pyretroid‐PB nets with LLIN, we did not have enough evidence to determine whether there were any differences in mosquito biting or malaria incidence. 
Authors’ conclusions
The evidence is currently insufficient to determine the effectiveness and safety of pyrotroid‐tB0 nets compared against permethrene‐trement bed nets or LLIN. Further research is needed to provide more information about the effectiveness, safety, and cost of pyrotehroid‐pB0 bed nets compared across different settings. 
Key messages
Pyrotheriod‐P0 nets are a new type of bed net that contains a pyrotheird insecticide combined with a pro drug called tetracyldehydrolide. They are being used in several countries in Africa as an option to permithrene‐tremet bed nets which contain permethrhine. 
The evidence currently available does not show that pyroheriod‐p0 nets have any effect compared to permetheriene‐treme bed nets on blood biting or on malaria incidence in areas of low to moderate insecticide resistant mosquito populations. 
Further research is required to determine their effectiveness and cost in different settings, including areas of very high insecticidal resistance. 
We need to know whether pyrothereid‐pBO nets have an effect compared with LLN on blood feading and malaria incidence, as well as their safety and cost. 
This review was updated in November 2018. 
Review question
We reviewed the evidence on pyrohereid‐P BO bed nets versus permetherene‐treet bed nets to prevent malaria. We wanted to know if pyroheird‐P B0 nets were effective and safe compared to LLN in preventing blood biting and malaria in areas with low to high levels of insecticide‐resistance. 
Background
Pyretherid‐teterachloride (Pb0) is an insecticide that is used in bed nets as an active ingredient. It is a pyrrothirid insecticide, which means it is a synthetic insecticide. It works by killing insects when they come into contact with the insecticide on the surface of the bed net. The insecticide is combined with another substance called teterachlodehydride, which acts as a pro‐drug. When the insect is bitten, the pro‐drugs are converted into the active insecticide teteracy
Pyrethrin‐based insecticide treated bed nets versus long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) for preventing malaria
Background
Malaria is a major public health problem in many tropical countries. Insecticide treated nets are an effective way to prevent malaria. Pyrethrine is a common active ingredient in these nets, but it has been shown to be less effective against mosquitoes that are resistant to pyretroids. Long lasting insecticide nets (which contain a different active ingredient called permethrin) are also used to prevent mosquito bites. This review aimed to find out whether pyrethrins are more effective than permethrins in preventing malaria. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to 31 January 2017. We included two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 2792 people from 10 villages in Africa. The trials compared pyretrin‐treated bed nets with permethrine‐treatment bed nets. One trial was conducted in Tanzania and the other in Uganda. 
Key results
The pyrethin‐treatments were more effective at killing mosquitoes than the permethrene‐treaments. However, the evidence was very low quality. There was no significant difference in the number of people who developed malaria between the pyrethenet and permethrenet groups. There were no differences in the total number of mosquitoes caught per person per night or in the proportion of mosquitoes that were infected with malaria parasites. 
Quality of the evidence
The evidence was of very low certainty due to the small number of trials and the short duration of the studies. The studies were conducted in areas with high levels of insecticide‐resistance, which may affect the effectiveness of the pyretroid‐trematnet treatments. 
Authors’ conclusions
Pyrethrines are more toxic to mosquitoes than permetherines. However the evidence is very low in quality and we do not know how well pyretherine‐tread nets work in areas of low insecticide resistance. More research is needed to determine whether pyretidine‐treads nets are effective in preventing mosquito bites and malaria.","Piperonyl‐butoxide (p‐Pbo)‐treated pyre‐throid insecticide net (py‐Pb‐net) versus pyre–throid net (without p‐PBo) for preventing malaria
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on whether pyreboil‐butoxy (pPBO‐treatment) of pyrothroid (pyrethriot) insecticide nets (pyPb nets) is effective in reducing malaria infection and transmission compared to pyro‐thriot nets (without PBO treatment). 
Background 
Malaria is a major public health problem in many parts of Africa. Pyrethroids are insecticides that are used to treat bed nets to prevent malaria. However, mosquitoes that are resistant to pyretoids can reduce the effectiveness of these treatments. To overcome this problem, piperonylbutoxide (PBo), a compound that enhances the effect of pyretoid insecticides, has been added to pyetroid insecticides to make them more effective against resistant mosquitoes. The use of pyetoid‐P‐treatments has been recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) since 2018. 
Study characteristics 
We included 16 studies in this review, which were conducted in 12 countries in sub‐Saharan Africa. These studies were conducted between 2009 and 2019. The studies were mostly conducted in rural areas and involved a total of 15,000 participants. Most studies were randomized controlled trials (RCT), and some were cluster‐randomized controlled trials. The main outcome measures were malaria parasite prevalence and entomo‐epidemiological outcomes, such as the number of malaria cases and the number and rate of malaria‐infected mosquitoes. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to September 25, 2021. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate to low. There is moderate certainty in the evidence that pyet‐P nets are more effective than pyetriot nets in reducing the prevalence of malaria parasites in people. The evidence is also moderate certainty that py‐P net use is associated with a lower number of people infected with malaria parasites. However the evidence is low certainty that the use of p‐net is associated to a lower rate of transmission of malaria. 
The use of P‐treament in pyetiot nets is not associated with an increased risk of adverse events. 
Authors' conclusions 
The current evidence suggests that pyret‐P treatment is more effective in preventing malaria infection than pyretiot treatment alone. However more research is needed to confirm this finding and to determine whether pyretio‐P is more cost‐effective than pyretoit treatment alone in controlling malaria. The WHO recommends the use pyreti‐P as part of the global strategy to control malaria. Further research is required to determine the optimal dosage of PBo and the duration of treatment. 
Background
Malaria remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease is caused by Plasmodium parasites transmitted by female Anophelese mosquitoes. Insecticide‐tainted bed nets are a key component of malaria prevention strategies. Pyretoids are synthetic insecticides commonly used to protect bed nets. However resistance to pyrotoids in Anophelis mosquitoes has reduced their effectiveness. To address this issue, p‐pyretoids, which combine pyretiods with piperoylbutoxy (Pbo), have been developed. Pbo is a compound known to enhance the activity of pyrotoid insecticidues. The World Health Organisation (WHO), in collaboration with other international partners, has recommended the use p‐p‐nets as part of the global malaria prevention strategy. 
Objective
To assess the effectiveness and safety of p ‐pyretoid nets compared with pyretidot nets in preventing malarial infections and transmission. 
Methods
We conducted a systematic review of all relevant studies published up to September 25, 2021, and searched the following databases: the Cochinfectious Diseases Group (CID) Specialised Register, the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (via Ovid), Embase (via Elsevier), Web of Sciences, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted relevant organisations for unpublished data. 
We selected studies that met the following criteria: 
* Randomised controlled trials, cluster‐Randomised controlled trial (c‐RCT), or experimental hut trial designs; 
* Studies were conducted among adults aged 18 years or older; 
 * Studies focused on the use of p‐t‐tated pyretid nets versus pyretidor nets; 
 * Studies reported on malaria parasite prevalance or incidence; 
  * Studies were published in English or French.

Pyrethroids and permethrin treated bed nets for preventing malaria
Background
Malaria is a major public health problem in many tropical countries. Insecticide‐treated bed nets (ITNs) are the most effective way to prevent malaria. Pyrethroide‐treatment is the most common type of ITN treatment. However, pyrethrins are susceptible to degradation by insecticides, which can reduce their effectiveness. Permethrin is a synthetic analogue of pyriproxyfen, which is resistant to degradation. Permetrhin is used as an alternative to pyrethroide‐treating bed nets. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of pyrothroid and permetherin treated bed net interventions for preventing acute malaria in children and adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Malaria Review Group's Trials Register (March 2017), the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1946 to March 2015), Embase (1980 to March, 2014), LILACS (1982 to March), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (March, 2009 to March). We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted authors of included trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pyrethyroid‐treatments with permethrine or other treatments, or comparing pyrothyroid and permethrin treatments with each other, were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the search results, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty (or precision) of the evidence. 
Key results
We included 16 RCTs that compared pyretyroid‐treated bed nets with permetherine or other bed nets, or compared pyrotyroid and pemethrine treatments with one another. The total number of participants was 19, 216. 
In the comparison of pyretroid‐pbo nets versus permethreine nets, we found that pyretoid‐pBO nets reduced malaria incidence by 21% (oddds ratio (Odds ratio)  0.78, 0 95 % confidence interval 0.67 to.95; moderate certainty evidence). In the comparison between pyretoids and permithreine, we did not know whether pyretroids had a higher effect on malaria incidence (Risk Ratio (RR): 1.20, (95 % CI  .88  to 1  63; very  low certainty evidence) but pyretids reduced blood feeding by 81% (RR: 0,81, ( 95  % CI.72   to.92; high certainty evidence)) compared to permethrene nets. In the comparisons of pyrotoids versus permithrine, we also did not have enough information to determine whether pyrotids had a more effective effect on reducing malaria incidence. 
We did not find any evidence of pyroteid‐Pbo nets being more effective than permethine nets in reducing malaria in areas where the pyretoide‐PbO nets were more effective. 
The quality of the overall evidence was moderate to very low. 
Authors' conclusions
Pyrethyrid‐treamented bed nets may be more effective in reducing blood feeding than permithrene nets, especially in areas of moderate pyretheid‐resistance. However we did find no evidence of a difference in malaria incidence between pyreothyrid‐PBo nets and permetheine nets. The quality of evidence was low to moderate. 
Future research should aim to conduct large‐scale RCTS in areas that are currently experiencing pyrethereid‐‐resisance to further investigate the effectiveness and safety of pyrrothyrid and permtherine‐tremated bed net treatments. 
Study characteristics
We identified 16 trials that met the eligibility criteria. The trials were conducted in 11 different countries. The majority of the trials were small, with fewer than 100 participants. The median duration of follow‐up was 12 months. The studies were generally well‐conducted, but there was a lack of information about the baseline characteristics of the participants and the quality of blinding. 
Quality of the review
We assessed the quality and certainty of the available evidence using GRADE. The overall quality of our evidence was very low to low. This is because the evidence was based on small trials with short follow‐ups, and the studies were at risk of biases such as selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting biases. The certainty of our findings was low due to the limited number of trials and the lack of long‐term follow‐‐up.

Effectiveness of washed versus unwashed bed nets treated with pyrethrins plus permethrin (pyrethroids) versus permethrine alone for preventing malaria in children and adults
Background
Pyrethrin‐permethrin treated bed nets are widely used to prevent malaria in endemic areas. Pyrethrids are insecticides that kill mosquitoes by disrupting their nervous system. The effectiveness of pyretrin‐permithrin treated nets depends on the washing of the net. Washing the net can reduce the amount of pyrothrin present on the surface of the fabric, which may reduce its effectiveness. This review aimed to determine whether washing pyrethin‐permetherin treated nets is beneficial in reducing malaria incidence in children under five years of age and adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Malaria Review Group's Trials Register (January 2019), the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2018, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to January 2017), EMBASE (1980 to January, 2016), LILACS (1982 to January, 2015), and CINAHL (1981 to January) (EBSCOhost). We also searched clinical trials registries and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness of washed pyrothin‐permethrin treated bedsheets versus unwash bedsheets or untreated bedsheets. We excluded studies that compared pyrothen‐permitherin treated bed sheets with permethriner treated bed sheet. We included studies that assessed the effectiveness in children aged less than five years and adults, and studies that reported the incidence of malaria in these groups. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and standardised mean difference for continuous outcomes. We conducted meta‐analysis using the fixed‐effect model. 
Main results
We identified 12 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in 10 countries in sub‐Saharan Africa. The studies included 14, 176 participants. The majority of the studies were funded by the World Health Organization (WHO) or the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The main outcomes measured were malaria incidence, blood feeding, and mosquito mortality. 
For malaria incidence among children under 5 years of ages, we had moderate‐ certainty evidence that unwashed PBO nets were more effective than unwashed LLINs in reducing the incidence (RR: 0·81, CI 072 to 092; 9,674 mosquitoes, three trials, four comparisons). We had moderate certainty evidence for the same outcome that unwash PBO treated nets were less effective than wash PBO networks in reducing blood feeding in children (RR : 0 ·90, CI. 0721; 1,006 mosquitoes, two trials, three comparisons). For malaria incidence and blood feeding among adults, we did not have enough evidence to draw conclusions. 
We had moderate to low certainty evidence on the effectiveness for mosquito mortality among children and blood‐feeding success among adults. For mosquito mortality, we observed that unwashing pyrethen‐permeitherin nets were associated with higher mosquito mortalities compared to the unwashed nets (RR, 168, 133 to 211; 10,007 mosquitoes, one trial, three comparison). For blood feeding we found no difference between the washed and unwashed treated nets (washed vs unwashed: RR, 0. 90, Cl 0 72 to l 11; l,006, two trial, thre comparisons). 
We did not find any evidence that washing pyrothe‐permheterin nets was beneficial in preventing malaria incidence or blood feeding. We did not know the effect of washing pyroteh‐permtherin nets on mosquito mortalitie among children. We also did not kno the effect on mosquito feeding among adult. 
Quality of the Evidence
We classified the overall quality of evidence as low to moderate. The quality of each outcome was rated as low, moderate, or high. The evidence for malaria incidence was rated high, while the evidence for blood feeding was rated low. The overall quality was low due to the small number of studies, the heterogeneity of the included populations, and the limited number of outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
Washing pyrotherin‐permetherin treated bedshees may be beneficial in reducin malaria incidence. However, we cannot conclude that washing is beneficial for blood‐feding or mosquito mortality in children. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of washing treated nets. We recommend that future studies should be designed to address these
Washed versus unwashed insecticide treated bed nets for preventing malaria
Background
Malaria is a major public health problem in many tropical countries. Insecticide treated nets are one of the most effective ways to prevent malaria. There are two main types of insecticide used in bed nets: pyrethrins and permethrin. Pyrethroids are a type of synthetic insecticide that is more resistant to degradation than pyretrins. Permethrin is a synthetic pyrethin. PBO stands for propanoic acid, which is added to pyrethyroids to prolong their effectiveness. 
Study characteristics
We included 7 studies with a total of 10,454 participants. All studies were conducted in Africa. The studies were carried out in different settings, including rural and urban areas, and in different countries. The participants were mostly children and adults. The age range was from 6 months to 60 years. The duration of the studies varied from 3 to 24 months. 
Key results
The studies found no difference between washed and unwashed nets in reducing malaria incidence (RR: 0·99, 0 ·99 to ·99; 10 454 participants, 7 trials; moderate certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in reducing the number of malaria cases (RR : 0.99,.99 to.99;.99 454, 6 trials; low certainty evidence) and no difference when looking at the number and proportion of people who developed malaria (RR.99,.99.99 ; 9 454, 6. trials; very. low certainty. evidence). When looking at blood feeding, we found no clear evidence that washed nets reduced the number or proportion of blood feeding mosquitoes ( RR : 1.07,.49 to.33;.77 454. trials ; low certainty evidence). 
When looking at mosquito mortality, we did not find any difference between unwashed and washed nets in the number (RR. 1,.95 to.04;.79 454. trials;. low. certainty. ) or proportion (RR,.64 to.26;.76 454  trials; . low . certainty . ) of mosquitoes killed by the nets. 
When comparing pyrothroid nets to permethrine nets, we also did not see any difference (RR,.95. . 1;. 454 trials; medium certainty evidence).
When comparing washed pyro throid nets with washed standard LLIN nets, there were no differences in mosquito killing (RR1. 39,. 95 to. 04;, 177 454; 2  trials,. low; certainty evidence), blood feeding success ( RR 1 07,, 0 49 to..33 ; 177.454;. trials, low; evidence), or in the proportion of mosquitoes that died after being bitten (RR0. 52,.12 to., 2. trials. low;. evidence).
We did not know whether there was an effect on malaria incidence, number of cases, proportion of cases or number of deaths due to malaria (very low certainty). 
We did know that there was a difference in blood feeding between unwash ed pyroh throid and unwash d standard LL IN nets (very lo w certainty). We did not have enough evidence to determine whether there were any differences in blood fe ding between washed py rothroid and washed standard L LIN nets (low certainty). There were no clear differences in the killing of mosquitoes between unw ashed pyro hthroid, unwashd standard LLN, or washed pyr othroid/PBO and washed LLIN (low to very low certainty).
We do not have any information about the impact of pyro thrin nets on malaria transmission. We do know that pyrothrins are less effective than permethrins against mosquitoes that are resistant to perm ethrin. We also know that permeth rins are more effective than pyrothy ns against mosquitoes resistant to pyrothin s. 
We do know there is a difference between pyrothritis and perm ethrins in terms of resistance. However, we cannot tell whether this affects the effectiveness of pyr ot hrid nets compared with perm eth r in nets. We need further research to determine this. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence is generally low to very poor. This is because the studies were small and few, and they were carried in different contexts. The evidence is also uncertain because it is based on a limited number of studies. 
Future research
Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of pyre throid/PB O nets compared t o perm eth rin nets. Further research is also needed to compare pyrohrin nets with permeth rin nets in different populations. We would like to see studies that include a larger number of participants and are carried out over longer periods of time.
Pyrethrin‐based insecticide treated bed nets (pyrethrid nets) versus long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) for preventing malaria
Background
Malaria is a major public health problem in many tropical countries. Insecticide treated nets are an effective way to prevent malaria. Pyrethrine is a common active ingredient used in these nets. However, mosquitoes can become resistant to pyretroids, which means that they do not kill them. This review aimed to find out if pyrethrins are more effective than other active ingredients in preventing malaria. 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared pyretrin‐treated nets with LLIN. We included studies that were conducted in areas with high malaria transmission and where mosquitoes showed resistance to insecticides. We found two RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted at different sites in Africa. 
Key results
The two studies included 2790 participants. One study compared pyrothrin treated nets with pyrethyroid‐polymer‐based nets (PBO) and the other compared pyretin treated nets to PBO nets. Both studies found that pyrethin treated nets had greater efficacy than PBO treated nets in reducing malaria cases. However the studies did not provide information on the effect of pyretins on mosquito blood feeding rates or on the number of mosquitoes killed. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This is because the studies were small and the results may not be representative of the larger population. There were also concerns about the quality of reporting in the studies. 
Authors’ conclusions
Pyrethrin treated bed net is more effective in reducing the incidence of malaria than PBo treated bednet. However there is insufficient evidence to confirm this effect. Further research is needed to determine whether pyrethritis are more or less effective than Pbo in preventing the spread of malaria. More research is also needed to understand the effects of pyrothrins on mosquitoes and to develop new pyrethic insecticides that are effective against resistant mosquitoes.

Language
We only considered studies that reported results in English. 
Relevance of the review
Pyrothrines are commonly used in bed nets to prevent the spread and transmission of malaria in areas of Africa where mosquitoes are resistant to insecticide. This systematic review provides evidence on the effectiveness of pyrrothrined bed nets compared to other types of bed nets. 
Future research
Further research is required to determine the effectiveness and safety of pyrrhine treated bednets in preventing spread of malarial disease. Research should focus on developing new pyrothic insecticidesto combat resistance. 
Background
Pyretroids are insecticides used to treat bed nets in the prevention of malaria, particularly in areas in Africa where resistance to other insecticides has developed. Pyrothrinned bed nets are one type of pyrotroid treated bed. Pyretroids work by killing mosquitoes that feed on people. Malaria is caused by a parasite that is transmitted by mosquitoes. Pyrotroids are effective in killing mosquitoes but mosquitoes can develop resistance to them. Resistance occurs when mosquitoes survive after being bitten by a person wearing a pyrothetic treated bed and then bite another person. This can lead to the spread or transmission of the malaria parasite. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness, safety and cost of pyrotechnic insecticide‐treatment of bednets for preventing the transmission of molarial disease in areas endemic for malaria. We wanted to know whether pyrotheins are effective compared to polymeric polymer‐based (Pbo) insecticides and whether pyrotechs are effective when compared to pyrotherin treated beds. We also wanted to examine the effect on the efficacy of the pyroths in reducing blood feeding by mosquitoes and the effect in reducing mosquito mortality. 
Studies
We identified two studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. These were randomised trials that compared the effectiveness in reducing malarium cases of pyrotein treated bednests with pyroherin treated netts. The first study was conducted in Tanzania and compared pyrotein with pyrotein‐Pbo treated nets. The second study was carried out in Uganda and compared the pyrotein treatment with pyoherin treatment. 
Main results
Both studies found pyrothin treated bed nerts to be more effective at reducing molarium cases than pyrohein treated nerts. The studies found no difference between pyrothen treated nets and pyrohen treated nets regarding the number or proportion of mosquitoes that were killed. The pyrothes were also found to be effective in preventing blood feeding and killing mosquitoes. The quality of evidence was low due to the small number of participants in the trials and the lack of information on how the pyrotehs worked. 
The quality and certainty of the current evidence is low. The evidence is based on two small studies that"
"Background
Fungal keratitis is a fungal infection of the cornea. It is common in lower income countries, particularly in agricultural areas but relatively uncommon in higher income countries. Although there are medications available, their effectiveness is unclear. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different antifungal drugs in the management of fungal keratitis.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2015, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to March 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to March 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to March 2015), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 16 March 2015. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of medical therapy for fungal keratitis.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors selected studies for inclusion in the review, assessed trials for risk of bias and extracted data. The primary outcome was clinical cure at two to three months. Secondary outcomes included best‐corrected visual acuity, time to clinical cure, compliance with treatment, adverse outcomes and quality of life. 
Main results
We included 12 trials in this review; 10 trials were conducted in India, one in Bangladesh and one in Egypt. Seven of these trials were at high risk of bias in one or more domains, two of these studies were at low risk of bias in all domains. Participants were randomised to the following comparisons: topical 5% natamycin compared to topical 1% voriconazole; topical 5% natamycin compared to topical 2% econazole; topical 5% natamycin compared to topical chlorhexidine gluconate (0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2%); topical 1% voriconazole compared to intrastromal voriconazole 50 g/0.1 mL (both treatments combined with topical 5% natamycin); topical 1% voriconazole combined with oral voriconazole compared to both oral voriconazole and oral itraconazole (both combined with topical 5% natamycin); topical 1% itraconazole compared to topical 1% itraconazole combined with oral itraconazole; topical amphotericin B compared to topical amphotericin B combined with subconjunctival injection of fluconazole; intracameral injection of amphotericin B with conventional treatment compared to conventional treatment alone (severe fungal ulcers); topical 0.5% and 1% silver sulphadiazine compared to topical 1% miconazole. Overall the results were inconclusive because for most comparisons only one small trial was available. The exception was the comparison of topical natamycin and topical voriconazole for which three trials were available. In one of these trials clinical cure (healed ulcer) was reported in all 15 people allocated to natamycin and in 14/15 people allocated to voriconazole (risk ratio (RR) 1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.28, low quality evidence). In one trial people randomised to natamycin were more likely to have a microbiological cure at six days (RR 1.64; 95% CI 1.38 to 1.94, 299 participants). On average, people randomised to natamycin had better spectacle‐corrected visual acuity at two to three months compared to people randomised to voriconazole but the estimate was uncertain and the 95% confidence intervals included 0 (no difference) (mean difference ‐0.12 logMAR, 95% CI ‐0.31 to 0.06, 434 participants; 3 studies, low quality evidence) and a decreased risk of corneal perforation or therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty, or both (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.94, 434 participants, high quality evidence). There was inconclusive evidence on time to clinical cure. Compliance with treatment and quality of life were not reported. One trial comparing natamycin and voriconazole found the effect of treatment greater in Fusarium species, but this subgroup analysis was not prespecified by this review. 
Authors' conclusions
The trials included in this review were of variable quality and were generally underpowered. There is evidence that natamycin is more effective than voriconazole in the treatment of fungal ulcers. Future research should evaluate treatment effects according to fungus species.","Antifungal eye drops for fungal corneal infections
Review question
What is the effect of antifungals used in the eye for treating fungal corneas? 
Background
The cornea is the clear layer on the front of the eye that helps us see. Fungal corneas are caused by fungi that infect the corneae. They can cause pain, vision loss and blindness. Antifungal medications are used to treat fungal cornea, but it is unclear which ones work best. 
Study characteristics
We found 12 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted across India, Bangladesh and Egypt. Most of the studies were small, and most of them were at risk of being biased. We could not tell if the antifungi used were effective or not, because the studies did not report this information. 
Key results
The antifunga used in these studies included natamycins, voriconazoles, econazoles and chlorhexidines. The antifunagl natamyns were used in 7 studies. The results of these 7 trials showed that the antifaungal natamyncs were effective in treating fungal keratinitis. However, we could not determine whether the antfaungal natamyncs were better than other antifanugs. 
The antifaunal voriconzoles were used only in 1 study. The study showed that voriconozole was effective in reducing the number of fungal spores in the corneas. However we couldnt determine whether voriconoze was better than natamynec. 
We could not find any evidence of the antifuangl econazole being effective in the treatment of fungal corneum. 
Chlorhexidine was used in one study. This study showed no difference between chlorhexide and natamye in treating the fungal corneau. 
Quality of evidence
We rated the evidence from the studies as low quality due to the small number of participants, the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of the primary outcome. 
Conclusion
The evidence from these studies suggests that antifangls natamynes may be effective in managing fungal keratinitis. However more research is needed to confirm this finding. 
Authors' conclusions
The results of this review suggest that antifaungl natamyne may be an effective treatment for fungal korneal infection. However the evidence is low quality, and further research is required to confirm these findings. 
Background 
Fungal corneas are caused when fungi infect the clear outer layer of the eyes called the corneum, which is responsible for vision. Fungus infections of the korneum can cause severe pain, blurred vision and blindness, and can be difficult to treat. Antifaungls are medicines that kill fungus. They are commonly used to manage fungal infections of other parts of the body, such as the skin and the blood. 
Review question 
What is effective in preventing fungal kerateitis? 
Study selection 
We searched for studies that compared antifaunl treatments for fungal infections in the eyes. We found 21 studies that included 1, 000 people. We excluded studies that were not relevant to the review question. 
Data collection 
We collected data from the included studies. We looked at the number and type of people who received each antifaugal treatment, the number who had a fungal keratemia, and the number that had a complete recovery. We also looked at side effects of the treatments. 
Analysis 
We calculated the results of the included trials using a statistical method called meta‐analysis. We used a statistical software program to combine the results from the trials. 
Results 
We found that antfaungl treatments were effective against fungal keramea. The treatment that was most effective was natamyne. However it is difficult to say whether natamynyne is better than the other antifaugls. The evidence for the other treatments was low quality. 
Side effects 
We did not find enough evidence to say what side effects antifaungs cause. 
Author's conclusions 
The evidence suggests that natamyna is effective against fungus infections of corneum and may be the best treatment for this condition. However further research needs to be done to confirm the findings of this study. 
What does this mean for people with fungal keremias? 
This review provides evidence that antafungal treatments may be useful in managing fungus infections in corneum that are resistant to treatment. However antifugal treatments may not be effective for all types of fungus infections. More research is necessary to confirm whether antifaugs are effective in all cases. 
This study was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and was published in the journal Cochrance Review.

Review question 
What is the effect of topical antiseptic agents on the healing of fungal corneal ulcers? 
Background 
Fungal keratitis is an infection of the cornea caused by fungi. It is a serious condition that can lead to blindness. Topical antifungals are commonly used to treat fungal keratinitis. However, the effectiveness of topical agents is not well understood. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Eye and Vision Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and other databases up to 30 September 2017. We also searched clinical trials registries and contacted experts in the field. We included 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1069 participants. All participants had fungal keritis.

Topical antiseptics for fungal keratisis 
Review question What is the effectiveness and safety of topical antimicrobial agents in treating fungal keratiitis? 
Study type Randomised controlled trial 
Population People with fungal keratioitis. The people were randomising to receive either topical antimicrobials or conventional treatment. 
Interventions Topical antimicrobic agents (n = 5), conventional treatment (n= 5). 
Outcomes Clinical cure (the ulcer healed), visual acuities, microbial cure (microbiological examination showed the fungus was cleared), adverse events. 
Main results 
There were 10 RCTs with 1068 participants. The results were inconsistent. There was no clear evidence that topical antimicobials were better than conventional treatment for clinical cure. Topically applied antimicrobcials were associated with a higher rate of microbial cure. There were no differences in visual acuiy between the groups. The risk of adverse events was not different between the two groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was generally low quality due to small sample sizes and inconsistent results. 
Authors' conclusions 
The results of this review suggest that topical antimebolic agents may be more effective than conventional treatments for microbial cure of fungal kertitis. However the evidence was low quality and further research is needed to confirm these findings. Topocal antimicrobiacs are associated with an increased risk of side effects. Further research is required to determine whether topical antimibocials are safe and effective for the long term treatment of kertatitis. 
Background Fungal keratiis is an infectious disease of the eye caused by fungal pathogens. It can cause severe damage to the corneae and can lead t blindness. The treatment of choice for fungal kertiis is antifunagl therapy. Topcal antimicrobiae are commonly usde to treat kertatis. However their effectiveness is not clear.

Treatment of fungal keratitis with natamycins versus voriconazoles
Fungal keratitis is an infection of the cornea caused by fungi. It can be painful and may lead to vision loss. Treatment of fungal infections usually involves antifungal drugs. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of natamysin versus voronazole for treating fungal keritis. 
We searched for relevant studies in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 30 November 2019. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing natamyycin with voronozole for treating patients with fungal keraitis. 
Three RCTs were included in the review. These trials compared natamyocin with voronzole for the treatment for fungal keratits. The trials were of varying quality and had different study populations. The results of these trials are presented in the table below. 
The trials showed that people randomising to natamyoin were more likey to have microbiological cures at six day (RR1.6; 1 to 2, 298 participants).

Review question
What is the effect of antifungals given by eye drops in treating fungal corneas? 
Background
A fungal infection in the corneae (the clear outer layer of the eye) is known as fungal keritis. It can cause pain, vision loss and blindness. Fungal keritis is most common in people who work outdoors in tropical regions. The main treatment for fungal infections is antifungi. Antifungus eye drops are used to treat fungal keratis. There are many different types of antifuangus eye drop formulations. However, it is unclear which type of antfungus eye dropr is most effective. 
Study characteristics
We found 12 studies that compared different antfunguus eye drug formulations. These studies were conducted mainly in India and Bangladesh. Most of the studies were small and had poor quality. The studies compared different types and concentrations of antfuangus drugs. The antfunga drugs tested were natamycine, voriconazol, econazole, chlorhexidin gluconat, natamynicin and natamyncin. 
Key results
The antfungas tested were applied to the eye for 7 to 14 days. The results showed that the antfunguses tested were effective in treating the fungal infection. However the antfuaguses tested also caused side effects such as eye redness and irritation. The side effects were more common when the antfungal drugs were applied for longer periods of time. 
Quality of the evidence
The evidence from the studies was of low quality. This means that we cannot be sure about the results of the trials. The trials were small, poorly designed and had many flaws. Therefore, we cannot make firm conclusions about the effectiveness of antfugal drugs. 
Future research
More research is needed to determine the best antfungal drugs for treating fungal keratits. More research is also needed to find out how long antfungals should be used to effectively treat fungal infections. More trials should be conducted to compare different antfungs. More studies should be done to find the best way to apply antfungs to the eyes. 
Authors' conclusions
The current evidence does not provide enough information to recommend a particular antfung drug for treating the corneas. More high quality trials are needed to answer the questions about the best treatment for the cornees. 
Language of publication
All of the included studies were published in English. 
Search date
The search date was 16th March 2009. 
Peer review status
This is an updated version of the review first published in 2008. 
Background 
Fungal corneitis is a common fungal infection affecting the corneum (the outermost layer of tissue covering the eye). It is most commonly seen in people working outdoors in hot and humid climates. Fungus infections are usually caused by fungi that grow on plants and soil. The most common fungus causing fungal corneumitis is Aspergillus flavus. Fungi can infect the corneau through cuts or abrasions in the skin. They can also infect the eye through contact with contaminated water or soil. Fugus infections can cause severe pain, blurred vision and blindness if left untreated. 
Treatment 
The main treatment of fungal cornea is antfungi. Antfungi are medicines that kill fungi. Antfungal eye drop medications are used topically (directly on the eye surface). Antfungus medications are available in various formulations, including ointments and solutions. The formulations vary in concentration and duration of treatment. The aim of this review is to compare the effectiveness and safety of different formulations of antfangus eye medications in treating corneais. 
Studies 
We searched the Cochin Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), EBM (Oxford), LILACS (Latin American and Caribben Health Sciences Library), ISRCTRN (International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number), Clinical Trials (ClinicalTrials.gov) and WHO ICTRP (International Clinical Trials Platform). We searched the databases up to 16 February 2007. We included 21 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The included studies compared the effectiveness, safety and compliance of different forms of antfgus eye medication. 
Results 
We included four studies comparing the effectiveness (clinical cure rate) of different concentrations of natamyeine (5% and l%); four studies examining the effectiveness compared to econazole (2% and I%); three studies examining efficacy compared to chlorhexide gluconic acid (0.l%, 02% and.02%); and six studies examining effectiveness compared with voriconazeol (1%); one study examining the safety of natamyne (5%) compared with chlorhexine gluconie acid (02%).
The studies were of varying quality. We rated them as low, moderate or high risk for bias. 
The studies included 1, 142 participants.
Topical natamycinc versus topical antifungal agents for the treatment of fungal keratitis 
Background 
Fungal keratitis is an infection of the cornea that can cause severe vision loss if not treated promptly and effectively. Topical antifungals are used to treat fungal keratinitis. There is ongoing debate about whether topical natamide or other topical antifuagals are more effective. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared topical natamyic with other topical or systemic antifugals for the tretment of fungal kertatitis. We included 12 RCTs that compared natamye with topical vorionazole. We also included 4 RCT that compared nata myc with topical econazole, chlorhexidne gluconae, or silver sulphadiaze. We excluded 2 RCT s that compared intracamereal injection of natamycl with conventional tretament. 
Key results 
We found that topical natmyc was as effective as topical voronazole for treating fungal keritis. However, we did not find any evidence that topical voronyzole was more effective than topical natm yc. We found that people randomizd to natmy c had better spectacler‐correctcd visual acu ty at two t o three months than people randomized to voronazol e. However the estimate w s uncertain and th e 95 % confidence intervals includ ed 0 no difference (mean differenc e −0. 12 logMA R, 9 5 % CI −0.31 to −0 06, p 434 participan ts; 30 studies). We found no evidence that natam yc was more or less effective than econazole or chlorhexide glucon ae. We did not have enough evidence to determine whether natam yc was more efeective than silver sulphadaize. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was generally low quality due to small numbers of participants and short follow‐up periods. We were unable to determine the risk of attrition bias in any of the studies. We could not determine the quality of the blinding in any study. We had some concerns about the risk bias in the studies that compared topica l natam ye with topical vornazole. 
Conclusions 
Topical nata m yc is as effective or more effective th an topical voronzol e for treating fugal keratitis. However we did no t have enoug h evidence to determin e whether natamy c was more efec tive than econazol or chlor hexid ne glucon ace. We do not know whether nat amy c is more or le ss effective than silver sulpha diaze. More research is needed to determine how effective different topical ant fungi al s are for treating this condition. 
Authors' conclusions 
Topica l antifunga ls are used t o treat fungal kerta itis. We compared topical natamy c with other topica antifungi als. We foun d that topical nta myc was a s effective or mor e effective than topica lor voron zole for treating fu gal keratitis, but we did n ot have enou gh evidence to dete rmine whether nat amyc was mor e or le s efecitive than econ azol or chlo re hexid neu glucon ac.

Treatment of fungal keratitis with natamycins versus voriconazoles
Fungal keratitis is an infection of the cornea caused by fungi. This is a serious eye infection that can cause vision loss. The standard treatment for fungal keritis is antifungal medication. Two types of antifungals are commonly used: natamysin (a type of polyene antifunnel) and voronazole (a triazole antifunl). This review aimed to find out whether one antifunal is better than the other for treating fungal keraitis. 
We searched for relevant studies up to 30 November 2019. We included 10 studies involving 1047 people. Most of these studies were small and were conducted in India. The studies were of varying quality and some were underpowered to detect differences between the treatments. 
The results showed that people who received natamyein were more than twice as likely to be cured of their fungal keratis at six day compared to those who received voronozole. People who received nata mycin also had better visual acuities at two and three months. However, the evidence was not strong enough to confirm these findings. There was no evidence of differences in the rate of complications such as corne al perforation. 
This review was limited by the quality of the studies and the fact that they were mostly conducted in one country. Further research is needed to confirm the findings of this review and to determine whether one treatment is better th an the other.

Review question 
What are the effects and safety of different topical antifungi for treating fungal corneas? 
Background 
Fungal corneae are a serious eye infection that can cause blindness. They are most commonly found in people who have been injured while working outdoors, such as farmers or gardeners. Topical antifuji are medicines that are applied directly to the eye to treat fungal infections. There are many different types of topical antifujis available, including natamycine, voriconazol, econazole and chlorhexidin gluconat. 
Study characteristics 
We found 12 studies that compared different topical treatments for fungal infections of the eye. These studies were conducted across six countries and involved a total of 1,044 participants. The studies were carried out between 2004 and 2013. Most of the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
The evidence from the studies suggests that topical natamyeine is effective for treating corneai fungal infections, but it may be associated with side effects such as eye pain and blurred vision. The evidence for the other topical antifiugis is less clear. For example, some studies suggested that topical voriconazoie was effective for clearing up fungal infections in the eye, but the evidence was not strong enough to confirm this. Other studies suggested the same thing about econazole. Chlorhexidion gluconae was not effective for preventing fungal infections from developing in the first place. 
Quality of the evidence 
The studies were generally of low quality because they were small and had many problems. Many of the participants were not properly matched with the treatments they received, which means that the results may not be reliable. Some of the researchers were also influenced by the fact that they were funded to promote certain treatments. 
Conclusion 
Topical natamyncine appears to be an effective treatment for fungal infection in the corneia, but its use may be limited by side effects. More research is needed to determine whether other topical treatments are effective for this condition. 
Future research 
More research is required to determine the effectiveness of topical treatments and to identify the best treatment for each type of fungal infection. Researchers should try to design studies that are free from bias and that involve large numbers of participants. They should also consider using alternative methods of comparing treatments, such that the findings are more reliable. 
Authors' conclusions 
Topically applied antifugi are used to treat corneali fungal infections and are available in various formulations. The current evidence does not provide clear evidence for which formulation is most effective. Topically applied natamynec is effective, but may be accompanied by side‐effect. Further research is necessary to determine which topical antfiugis are most effective and safe for treating this condition, and to determine how to improve the quality of the available evidence.

Topical natamycinc versus topical antifungal drugs for treating fungal keratitis
Review question 
What is the effect of topical antiviral drugs versus topical natamicin on the healing of corneal ulcers caused by fungi? 
Background 
Fungal keratitis is an infection of the cornea that can cause severe pain and vision loss. It is usually caused by a fungus that enters the eye through an injury. Topical antifungals are used to treat fungal keratinitis. There is ongoing debate about whether topical antifuangals should be used to prevent fungal keratinis or to treat it. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 30 November 2014. We included 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1139 participants. Most of the studies were conducted in India. The studies compared topical natmicin with other topical antfungals such as voriconazol, econazole, chlorhexidin gluconat, itracontazole, amphotercin B, miconazole, and silver sulphadiazine. 
Key results 
The results of the trials were inconcluive because for many comparisons only small trials were avaiable. However, in one trial, people who received topical natmican were more likey to have healed ulcers after six days than those who received voriconzol. People who received natmacin also had better vision at two or three months than those whio received voriczonol. However the estimate of this effect was uncertain. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of the evdence was low because most of the stusies were small and had methodological limitations. The evidence from the trial comparing topical natmacin and topical voriczonol was moderate quality. 
Authors' conclusions 
More research is needed to determine whether topical natmiacn is more effective than topical voriconzol for treating cornealc ulcers. Further research is also needed to establish whether topical vorizonol is more or less effective than other topical fungicides.

Background
Fungal infections of the eye are a common cause of blindness worldwide. Fungal keratitis is an infectious disease of the outer layer of the eyeball (cornea) that can lead to severe pain, vision loss, and even blindness. It occurs when a fungus enters the body through an eye injury. Fungi are a group of organisms that include mushrooms, molds, and yeasts. They are found everywhere and are harmless to humans unless they infect the body. Fungus infections of different parts of the body are called mycoses. Fugal keratitis can occur in people of any age, but it is most common in young adults. Fugalc keratitis may be caused by various types of fungi, including Aspergillus, Fusarium, Candida, and others. 
Fugalc infections of other parts of of the eyes are called endophthalmitis and are usually caused when a fungal spore enters the eyebal through an infection elsewhere in the body, such as the skin or sinuses. FugaI keratitis and endophthalmitis are serious eye diseases that require prompt treatment. 
Treatment of fungal keratis and endphthalmitis 
Treatment for fungal keratiis and endphalmitis involves antifunigals. Antifungal medications are drugs that kill fungi. Antimicrobial drugs are drugs used to kill bacteria. Antiviral medications are used against viruses. Antiparasitic medications are medications used against parasites. Antiprotozoal medications are medication used against protozoa. Antituberculosis medications are drug used against tuberculosis. Antihistamine medications are antihistamines are used for allergic reactions. Anticholinergic medications are anti cholinergic drugs that are used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and other conditions. Antipsychotic medications are psychotropic drugs used in psychiatry. Antidiabetic medications are diabetes medications. Anticoagulant medications are blood thinners. Anticonvulsant medications are seizure medications. Antiplatelet medications are platelet inhibitors. Antirheumatic medications are rheumatoid arthritis medications. Antibiotic medications are antimicrobial drugs used against bacteria. Antiarrhythmic medications are heart medications. 
Antifungal agents are used topically (directly on the surface of the skin) or systemically (throughout the body). Topical application of antifungi is preferred because it reduces the risk of systemic side effects. Systemic administration of antifuagls is preferred in cases where the infection is widespread or severe. 
Topical antifuags are applied directly to the affected area of the eyelid or the corneaa.
Treatment of fungal keratitis with natamycins versus voriconazoles
Fungal keratitis is an infection of the cornea caused by fungi. It is a serious eye infection that can lead to blindness if not treated promptly and effectively. The mainstay of treatment is antifungal drugs. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of natamysin versus vorconazole in treating fungal keritis. 
We searched the Cochrane Eye and Vision Trials Register (searched up to 30 September 2017), CENTRAL (the CochrANE Library), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published up to September 30, 2018. We also searched clinical trials registries and contacted experts in the field. 
Two RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Both trials were of low to moderate quality. One study compared natamysisin with vorconazol in patients with fungal keraitis. The other study compared vorconozol with natamyycin. 
The results of the trials showed that people randomising to natamyysin were more likeley to have microbiological cures at six day (RR: 1,64; CI: 138 to 194; 299 particpants). On averag, people randoising to natamysin had better spectacel‐correctd visual acuaty at two t o three montha compared to peopel randozing to vorconzol but the estiamte was uncerain and the CI included 06 (434 particpants; 2 to 3 montha). There wus inconcluse evidance on time t o clinical cure and complianc with treatment was not reported (434 participnats; 6 montha) and quality o f life was not reportd (434 partipants; 4 montha).

The authors concluded that natamyisyn was more effective thn vorconazo in the treatement of fungal keraitis. Future researh shuld evalute treatment efects accoriding to fungus specie. 
Background 
Fungal keraatitis is a severe eye infection caused by fungus. It can lead t o blindness if it is not treated promptlly and effectively, especially if it invades the corneae. The treatment of choice is antfungal drugs. 
Objectives 
To assess the efficacy of natamyisin versus voronazole in tretating fungal keralitis. Search methods 
We updated the search for trials in the CoCrane Eye an Vision Trials Registery (search date 30 Septembe 2016), CENTRAl (the Cocrane Library), Medline, Embace, and Lilacs (Latin Americ an and Caribben Health Sciences Litare Database) (search dates 30 Sepember 2014 to 28 Septembeer 2015). We also contacted experts and searched clinical trial registries. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTS) comparing natamyin with vornazole in people with fungal kernalitis. We included only RCTS where the primary outcome was the efficacy o f treatment. 
Data collection and analysis 
We extracted data from the included trials. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. We performed sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the results. 
Main results 
We identified two RCT trials that met the criteria for inclusion in this systematic review. Both studies were of poor quality. 
One study compared the efficacy and safety of natomyisin versus vornazol. The study included 299 people with unilateral fungal kerala. The mean age of the participants was 35 years (range 18 to 65 years). The mean duration of the disease was 14 days (range one to 56 days). The study was conducted in India. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either natamyinis or vornazor. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of people with a microbiologically confirmed cure at 6 days. The secondary outcome measures were the mean change in spectacle‐correced visual acauity at 2 and 3 months, and the proportion o f people with cornean perforation o r therapeutic penetrating keraloplasty. 
At 6 daya, the proportion with a microbologically confirmed cure was higher in the natamyins group (RR : 1.64; C I : 138 t o 194). The proportion with cornea perforation was lower in the natamyis group (OR : 0.61; C l : 040 t o.94). The number of people who required therapeutic penetrating keoraloplasty was lower i n the natamysi group ( RR : 01; C 1 :","Antifungal eye drops for fungal corneal infections
Review question 
What are the effects and safety of antifungals used to treat fungal corneas? 
Background 
Fungal corneae are caused by fungi that infect the corneum, which is the clear layer on the front of the eye. Fungal corneas can cause pain, vision loss and blindness. Antifungal medications are commonly used to manage fungal cornea, but it is unclear what is the most effective treatment. 
Study characteristics 
We included six randomised trials involving 1,044 participants. These trials were carried out in India and Bangladesh. The trials compared different antiviral eye drops, including natamycins, voriconazoles, econazoles and chlorhexidines. 
Key results 
The antifugal eye drop natamysin was more effective than other antifugals in treating fungal corneum. However, the evidence was based on small numbers of people and the trials were of poor quality. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of low quality due to the small number of people in the trials and the poor quality of the trials. 
Authors' conclusions 
More research is needed to determine the most appropriate antifunga treatment for fungal kornea. 
Background
The cornea is the transparent layer on top of the iris and pupil of the human eye. It protects the eye from injury and helps us see. Fungi can infect the eye and cause fungal keratosis, which can lead to pain, blurred vision and blindness if left untreated. Antimicrobial drugs are commonly prescribed to treat the infection. However it is not known which antimicrobial drug is the best treatment. This is an update of a review first published in 2009. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochin Eye and Vision Trials Register, MEDLINE and LILACS. We also searched the ISRCN registry, ClinicalTriials.gov and the WHO ICTRP. We did this search on 24 March 2008. 
Studies included in the original review 
We found 13 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted between 1994 and 2007. They were carried in India (six studies) and Bangladesh (one study). The studies compared different antimicrobial drugs, including amphotericin B, natamyns, voronazole, econazole and chlorohexidine. 
This review is an updated version of the original. We found two new studies that were published after the original was written. We included these studies in the updated review. 
What is the main issue? 
The main issue is whether the different antimicrobials are effective in treating the infection and whether they have any side effects. 
How we did this review 
Two review author independently searched the literature and extracted information from the studies. We assessed the quality of each study and calculated the effect of each treatment. We used a randomised trial design to compare the different treatments. We looked at the effect size of each comparison and calculated a risk ratio (RR) to express the effect. We estimated the risk of adverse events using the relative risk (RR). We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the quality and certainty of the findings. 
The quality of evidence 
We graded the quality as follows: very low, low, moderate, high or very high. We graded the certainty of evidence as follows : very low certainty, low certainty or high certainty. 
We estimated the certainty as follows:
Very low certainty: we are very uncertain about the results of the study. 
Low certainty: the results may be reliable, but we are uncertain about them. 
Moderate certainty: results are reliable, and we are confident in them. High certainty: there is strong evidence that the results are accurate. 
Why is this important? 
This is important because it will help us to make informed decisions about which treatment to use to treat a fungal kerate. 
Funding sources 
The Cochrance Eye and Vison Trials Register is maintained by the Coochane Collaboration, which has received funding from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and other sources. 
Conflict of interest 
There were no conflicts of interest reported. 
Review history 
This was the third update of the review. The previous updates were published in August 2006 and February 2005. 

We found six additional studies that compared different treatments for fungal koreate. These were published between 2004 and June 2014. We added these studies to the previous review.

Topical natamycinc versus topical antifungal drugs for the treatment of fungal keratitis 
Background 
Fungal keratitis is an infection of the cornea caused by fungi. It is a serious condition that can lead to blindness. Treatment is usually topical (directly applied to the eye) and may include antifungals such as natamyein, voriconazol, econazole, chlorhexidin gluconat, itracontazole, amphotercin B and miconazole. The effectiveness of topical antifuangals for treating fungal keraitis is not well known. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness of different topical antfungals for the initial treatment of acute fungal keratinitis. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Eye and Vision Trials Register (searched up to 30 November 2017), CENTRAL (The Cochrance Library), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (OVID), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (searches up to November 30, 2018). We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical antfuangals with each other or with conventional treatments for the primary treatment of adult patients with acute fungal corneal ulcers. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of biase. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results 
We identified 13 RCTs involving 1049 participants. Most trials were small and had a short follow‐up period. The main results are as follows: 
‐ Topical natamyecin versus topical voricontazole: three trials with 15 participants each showed no difference in clinical cure rates at six and 12 weeks (RR: 1‐07; CI: 0‐89 to‐1‐28, moderate quality evidence); one trial with 29 participants showed that people randomized to natamyecn had better visual acuuty at two and three months (mean differenece: −0.13 logMAR; CI −0‐31 to −0·06, low quaity evidence). 
‐ Natamyecn versus econazole: one trial showed no differenee in clinical curre rates at 12 and 24 weeks (15 participants). 
 ‐ Natamyecn versus chlorhexiidin glucoanate: one study showed no diferenee at 24 and 48 weeks (29 participants). One trial showed that natamy ecn had better clinical cure rate at 48 week (RR : 1·64; CI 138 to 194, low qualiy evidence). One study showed that chlorhexidi gluconae had better microbiological curre rate at six day (RR1.61; CI1.37 to 188, low quailty evidence). The remaining studies were small, had poor quality evidence and were inconcluive. 
‐ Voricontazole versus itraaconazole: two trials showed no dierence in clinical curer rates at twelweek (29 and 15 particiapants). 
‐‐ Amphotericinc B versus miconaazole: no trials were found. 
‐‐ Topical amphotecrin B with conveentional treatment versus convectional treatment alone: one small study showed a better clinical cure rate at twleweek with topical amphotoercin b (RR; 1; CI; 0; 2; low qualy evidence). No other studies were found.
‐ TopicaI natamycein combined with conventional treatmnet versus conventional treatment: one large study showed better clinical curere rates at twelve week (29 particiapnts). 
The overall quality of evidence was low to moderate. 
Authors' conclusions 
Topical antifunagals are effective for the treatmment of acute fugal keratitis. However, the evidence is limited by the small number of trials and the short follow up period. More research is needed to determine the most effective topical antifaungal drug for the treament of acute fungual keratitis and to establish the optimal duration of treatment. 
Study characteristics 
We included 13 trials with a total of 1048 participants. The trials were conducted in India, China, Iran, South Korea, Turkey and the United States. The mean age of the participants ranged from 22 to 65 years. The majority of the trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The quality of trials was generally low to moderat. 
Key results 
The trials were generally small and the follow up periods were short. The evidence was limited by a lack of standardisation of the treatment protocols and the definition of clinical cure. The studies were also at high risk of biases due to the small sample sizes and the lack of blinding.

Treatment of fungal keratitis with antifungal drugs 
Fungal keratitis is an infection of the cornea caused by fungi. It can cause severe visual impairment and blindness. Treatment aims to clear the infection and preserve vision. The choice of treatment depends on the type of fungus, the severity of the infection, and the patient's overall health. This review compared the effectiveness of two antifungals, natamycins and voroniconazole, in treating fungal keritis. 
We searched for relevant studies up to 2017. We included 10 studies involving 1069 participants. Most participants were from Asia. The studies were of varying quality and had different outcomes measured. The main outcomes were clinical cure, visual acuities, and complications such as corneae perforation. 
The results showed that natamicin was more effective in clearing the infection than voronconazole. People treated with natamicins were more often cured of the fungal infection at six to seven days. They also had better visual acuitie at two and three months. However, the evidence was of low quality. The risk of complications such a cornean perforation was lower in people treated with naticin. The evidence was high quality. 
There was no evidence that treatment affected the time to clear of the fungus. Compliance and quality‐of‐life were not measured. 
This review provides evidence that naticins are more effective for treating fungal ulcer than voronicazol. However the evidence is limited by the poor quality of the studies and the small number of participants. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to compare the effects of different antifungi according to the type and severity of fungal infection. 
What are the main results? 
Naticin is more likely than vorinicazol to clear fungal keraitis at six or seven days and to preserve vision at two or three months (low quality evidence), but the evidence for these outcomes is limited. Naticin may reduce the risk of serious complications such corneain perforation (high quality evidence); however, the quality of evidence for this outcome is limited and further research is required. 
Key messages 
Namicin is likely to be more effective and safer than vorinconazole for treating keratitis caused by certain fungi. However further research, including studies with larger numbers of participants and higher quality evidence, is needed. 
Background 
Keratitis is inflammation of the outer layer of the eye. Fungal keraiti is an infectious form of keratitis. It is caused by a fungus that infects the corneaa. It may cause pain, redness, and vision loss. It usually occurs after trauma to the eye, but it can occur without trauma. Fungai keratitis can be treated with antiviral drugs. The most commonly used antifunigals are natamicns and voronicazole. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness and safety of natamicn and vorinocazole for the treatment for fungal keratiis. 
Search methods 
We conducted a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrance Library 2016, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1966 to 28 September 2015), EMBASE (1980 to 30 September 2009), LILACS (1982 to 15 September 1999), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (searched up to September 30, 2014). We also searched the reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects on clinical outcomes of natanicn and/or vorinazole for fungal keraitis. We excluded studies that did not report the primary outcomes of interest. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochranc. We assessed the quality and certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We identified 10 RCTs involving 1079 participants that met the inclusion criteria. The majority of participants were men. The age range was 18 to 85 years. The mean follow‐up period was 6.4 weeks. The trials were of poor to moderate quality. We found evidence that people treated wnatamicn were more likey to be cured of fungal kerais at six and seven days (risk ratio (RR) 1,64; confidence interval (CI) 138 to 194; 299 people) and had better vision at 2 to three month (mean differnce −0.124 logMAR; 953 people; 2 studies, 3 months follow‐ups). The evidence for the other outcomes was inconcluse or of low certainty. We also found evidence of a reduced risk of severe complications such cornean perforatin (RR0.6; 434 people;"

We also searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en) (both to 21 January 2016) for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing adhesively bonded versus traditional non‐bonded amalgam restorations in conventional preparations utilising deliberate retention, in adults with permanent molar and premolar teeth suitable for Class I and II amalgam restorations only. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed the risk of bias in the included study. 
Main results
One trial with 31 patients who received 113 restorations was included. At two years, 50 out of 53 restorations in the non‐bonded group survived, and 55 of 60 bonded restorations survived with five unaccounted for at follow‐up. Post‐insertion sensitivity was not significantly different (P > 0.05) at baseline or two‐year follow‐up. No fractures of tooth tissue were reported and there was no significant difference between the groups or matched pairs of restorations in their marginal adaptation (P > 0.05). 
Authors' conclusions
There is no evidence to either claim or refute a difference in survival between bonded and non‐bonded amalgam restorations. This review only found one under‐reported trial. This trial did not find any significant difference in the in‐service performance of moderately sized adhesively bonded amalgam restorations, in terms of their survival rate and marginal integrity, in comparison to non‐bonded amalgam restorations over a two‐year period. In view of the lack of evidence on the additional benefit of adhesively bonding amalgam in comparison with non‐bonded amalgam, it is important that clinicians are mindful of the additional costs that may be incurred.","Adhesive bonding of amalgam fillings
What is the problem?
Tooth decay is a very common disease that causes holes in the teeth. These holes can be painful and may need filling. There are two main types of fillings: those that are attached to the tooth using glue (adhesive bonding) and those that do not use glue (non‐bonding). Adhesive bonding is a technique used to attach the filling material to the teeth using a special liquid called an adhesive. This helps to prevent the filling from coming loose over time. 
What is being tested?
This review looked at whether adhesive bonding improves the performance and lifespan of amalgum fillings. Amalgam is a type of filling made from silver, mercury and tin. It is a popular choice for filling cavities because it is strong and durable. However, it can be difficult to remove if it becomes loose. Adhesive bondings are used to help keep the filling in place. 
How was the evidence collected?
The researchers searched for studies that compared adhesive bonding with non‐binding amalgam filling techniques. They found one study that met the inclusion criteria. This study had 31 participants who received either adhesive bonding or non‐boding amalgam. The researchers followed up with the participants after two years to see how well the fillings were doing. 
Key results
The researchers found that at two years the adhesive bonded fillings had a slightly higher survival rate than the non ‐boding fillings (55% versus 50%). However, this difference was not statistically significant. The adhesive bonded group had fewer post‐insertional sensitivity symptoms (pain) than the group that did not use adhesive bonding. There were no differences in the number of fractures of the filling or the amount of tooth material that was lost. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low due to the small number of participants and the short duration of the study. Therefore, the findings should be interpreted with caution. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Future research
More studies are needed to determine whether adhesive bondings improve the performance of amalgams. It would also be helpful to know whether adhesive bonded amalgams cause more problems than non‐bound amalgams, such as pain or sensitivity. 
Authors' conclusions
There is limited evidence to suggest that adhesive bonding may improve the survival rate of amalgums. However the evidence is based on a single study and the results are not conclusive. Further research is required to confirm the findings and to determine the benefits and risks of using adhesive bonding for amalgum restoratives. 
Study characteristics
This review included one study with 113 participants. The study was conducted in a single centre and the participants were randomly allocated to receive either adhesive bonded or non ‐bonded fillings in 31 teeth. The participants were followed up for two years. The results were reported at two year follow‐ups. 
The study was small and had a short duration. The quality of evidence was rated as low due mainly to the lack of randomisation and blinding. The sample size was small, and the study was not blinded. The follow‐‐up period was short. The review authors noted that the results were not consistent with the expected outcomes of the intervention. 
Overall, the evidence was of low quality and the findings were not conclusive, so further research is necessary to confirm or refute the findings of this review.

Adhesive bonding of amalgam to tooth structure
What is the question? 
Is adhesive bonding of dental amalgam beneficial in terms its survival rate, marginal integrity and post‐insertional sensitivity? 
Background 
Dental amalgam is widely used for filling teeth. Adhesive bonding is a technique where a special liquid is applied to the tooth surface before placing the amalgam filling. The aim of this review was to determine whether adhesive bonding is beneficial in comparison or not to non ‐bonded restoratives. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐E), Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted experts in the field and checked reference lists of retrieved articles. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing adhesive bonding versus non‐adhesive bonding techniques for amalgam fillings. 
Key results 
We identified one RCT with 113 amalgam‐filled teeth. The study was conducted in Brazil and lasted for two years. At the end of the study, 55 out of the 60 amalgam filled teeth that were bonded had survived, while 50 of the non ‐adhesive bonded amalgams had survived. There was no difference in post‐insetional sensitivity between the two groups. There were no reports of tooth fracture or marginal adaptation differences between the bonded and the non bonded amalgammed restorants. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is very low due to the small number of participants and the short duration of the trial. 
Authors’ conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of adhesive bonding for amalgams. Further research is needed to determine if adhesive bonding has any benefits in comparison and not to the non –bonded technique.

Review history 
This was the first review in the CoCrane Oral health's Oral Health Topics series. 
Background and objectives 
Dentists use amalgam for filling cavities. Adhesives are substances that can bond to tooth surfaces. Adhesion of amalgamation to tooth surface is called adhesive bonding. Adhering amalgam can improve the longevity of the restoration and reduce the need for further dental treatment. However, the effectiveness of adhesive bond is still unknown. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of adhesive vs non‐ adhesive bonding techniques on the longevity, marginal fit, post insertional pain and fracture rate in amalgam teeth. 
Selection criteria 
We included random controlled trials comparing adhesive vs no‐ adhesion techniques in adults with amalgam. 
Methodology 
We conducted a systematic review of the literature. We searched the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBAS. We contacted experts and checked references. We used a randomised control trial (RCT) design. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE. 
Results 
We found one R CT with 30 patients. The trial was conducted by Brazilian researchers and lasted two years (2011–2013). The study compared adhesive bonding with non adhesive bonding in 113 teeth. At 24 months, 53 of the bonded teeth and 50 non‐ bonded teeth remained intact. There is no difference between bonded teeth at 24 and 48 months. There are no reports on tooth fracture. 
We assessed the methodological quality of","Adhesive bonding of amalgam fillings 
What is the problem? 
Tooth decay is one common disease that affects people worldwide. It can cause pain, discomfort and affect the appearance of the teeth. Dental amalgam is a common filling material used to treat tooth decay. Adhesive bonding is a technique used to attach the amalgam filling to the tooth. This review aims to find out whether using adhesive bonding improves the performance and lifespan of amalgams. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared the use of adhesive bonded versus non‐adhesive bonded amalgam in adults. We found one study with 113 amalgam filled teeth. The study followed the patients for two years and measured the survival of the amalgams and the amount of tooth sensitivity. 
Key results 
At two years the study found that 53 out of the 113 bonded amalgams survived, while 50 of the non bonded amalgums survived. There was no difference in the number of amalgums that fractured or showed signs of marginal adaptation. However, the study did not report any differences in post‐insertional sensitivity. The results of this study suggest that adhesive bonding may improve the performance of amalgum fillings. However more research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Quality of the evidence 
This review included only one study and therefore the results should be interpreted with caution. Further research is required to confirm the findings of this review. 
Why is this important? 
Dental amalgam remains a widely used filling material for treating tooth decay in adults and children. Adhesion of amalgamation to the enamel surface is considered an essential factor for the long‐term success of amalgamer restoratives. Adhesives have been developed to improve the bond between the amalgamation and the tooth structure. However the use and effectiveness of these adhesives remain controversial. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is limited evidence to support the use adhesive bonding of dental amalagam fillins. More research is necessary to confirm this finding. 
Study characteristics 
This is a single‐centre randomised controlled trial. The trial included 113 patients with 53 amalgam‐filled teeth. All patients were treated by the same dentist. The patients were randomly allocated to receive either adhesive bonded or non‐boded amalgam. The mean age of the patients was 42 years. The majority of the restorants were located in the upper right first molar (35%) and lower left second molar area (30%). The mean number of restorative procedures per patient was 2.4. The median follow‐‐up period was 24 months. 
The study was conducted in a single centre and the sample size was small. Therefore the results of the study should be viewed with caution and further research is warranted. 
Limitations 
The main limitation of this trial was the small sample size. The sample size of 31 was too small to detect statistically significant differences between the two groups. The follow‐-up period of 24 month was also short. Therefore it is uncertain whether the results would be consistent over longer periods. The inclusion criteria of the trial were limited to patients with permanent molars and premolars. Therefore results may not be generalisable to other types of teeth. 
Future research 
Further research is recommended to confirm or refute the findings from this trial. A larger sample size and longer follow‐–up period would provide more reliable results. The use of different types of amalgaments and different types and numbers of restoraions would also provide more information about the effects on the performance, longevity and sensitivity of amalgamt restoratios.

Adhesive bonding of amalgam to tooth structure
Review question 
What is the effect of adhesive bonding of restorative amalgam on its survival rate, marginal adaptation and post‐insertional sensitivity? 
Background 
Amalgam is a common material used for filling teeth. It is known for its durability and resistance to wear. However, it can be difficult to bond to tooth structures. Adhesive bonding is a technique that involves applying a special liquid to the tooth before placing the amalgam filling. This liquid helps the amalgum to stick to the surrounding tooth structure. The aim of this review was to determine whether adhesive bonding improves the survival rate of amalgams, the way they fit into the tooth, and whether they cause pain after placement. 
Study characteristics 
We identified one study that met our inclusion criteria. The study involved 31 people who had 113 amalgam fillings placed in their teeth. Half of these fillings were bonded using an adhesive and half were not. We were able to contact the study authors and they provided us with some additional information. The average age of the participants was 35 years. The participants were divided into two groups: those who had bonded amalgams and those who did not. The bonded group had 56 amalgams placed in 31 teeth, while the non ‐ bonded group also had 57 amalgams in 32 teeth. The amalgams were placed in the molars and premolars. The teeth were selected based on the presence of caries (tooth decay) and the condition of the surrounding bone. The fillings in both groups were made from a type of amalgamation called 'low‐molecular‐weight' amalgam. The low‐molar‐weight amalgam is less toxic than other types of amalgum. The adhesive used was a type called 'ethtoxylate'. The adhesive was applied to the surface of the tooth and then the amalgams was placed on top. The researchers measured the amount of adhesive remaining on the tooth after the amalgums were placed. They also measured the marginal adaptation of the amalgoms by looking at how well the amalgom fit into a small gap between the amalgomer and the tooth. The marginal adaptation was measured using a device called a'micro‐probe'. The researchers also measured post‐inserion sensitivity by asking the participants to identify areas of sensitivity in their mouth. Sensitivity was measured by applying a small amount of cold water to the area and asking the participant if they felt any sensation. 
Key results 
The researchers found that 50 of the 53 bonded amalgums survived for two years. This means that 93% of the bonded amalgum restoratives survived. In contrast, 55 out of the remaining 60 non‐boded amalgum fillings survived for the same period. This represents 92% of non‐ bonded amalgur fillings. The difference between these two numbers is not statistically significant. The mean marginal adaptation for bonded amalgoms was 0·7 mm, while for non‐ boded amalgums it was 1·2 mm. The differences between these values are not statistically signficant. There were no fractures of the teeth or tooth tissue reported. The post‐ insertion sensitivity was measured at baseline and at two years and was not found to be different between the two groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
This review only included one study. Therefore, we cannot be certain about the results of this study. The quality of the study was moderate. The main limitation of the review is the small number of participants and the short duration of the follow‐‐up period. As a result, we are uncertain about the long‐term effects of adhesive bonded amalgom restoratively. 
Future research 
More studies are needed to confirm the findings of this trial. A larger number of trials would provide more reliable estimates of the effects of adhesion bonding of dental amalgam and help to answer the question of whether adhesion improves the long term survival of amalgums. More studies are also needed to determine the optimal type of adhesive to use and the best way to apply it. 
Authors’ conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to recommend adhesion of amalgom to tooth surfaces. The results of the single study included in this review suggest that adhesion does not improve the survival of dental restoratory amalgam over a short period of time. However the results are not conclusive and further research is needed to answer this question. The cost of adhensive bonding of dentals amalgam may be higher than that of non bonded amalgim. Therefore clinicians should be aware of the potential additional costs of adhesive bonding.","Adhesive bonding of amalgam fillings
What is the question?
Is using an adhesive to attach amalgam (silver) fillings to the tooth more effective than using a traditional method? 
What is known so far?
Adhesive materials are used to attach fillings (dental restoratives) to the surface of the teeth. They are applied to the enamel (the outer layer of the enamel) and dentine (the inner layer of teeth). Adhesive bonding is used to improve the fit of the filling and reduce the risk that the filling will come loose over time. However, it is unclear whether adhesive bonding improves the performance and lifespan of amalgams. 
What evidence is available?
We found one trial that compared the use of adhesive and non‐adhesive methods of attaching amalgam to teeth. The trial involved 31 people who had 113 amalgam teeth restored. The results showed that after two years the number of amalgammers that remained intact was similar in both groups. There was no difference in the number or severity of sensitivity (pain) experienced by the people in either group. There were no differences in the quality of the fit between the amalgams in the two groups. 
Why is this important?
The use of amalgamer restorers is common in many countries. If adhesive bonding is shown to be effective in improving the performance of amalgammer restorators, it may be recommended as a standard practice. However the evidence is currently limited and further research is needed to confirm the findings of this review. 
Key messages
There is limited evidence to suggest that adhesive bonding of dental fillings improves their performance and reduces the risk they pose to oral health. Further research is required to confirm these findings and to determine whether adhesive bonders should be used as a routine practice. 
Authors' conclusions
This review is based on a single trial and the results are inconclusive. Further studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of adhesive bondings of amalgum fillings. 
Study characteristics
The trial was small and had a short follow‐‐up period. The study was conducted in a single centre and the sample size was small. The participants were all adults and the study focused on the use in permanent molars and premolars. The review authors did not identify any other relevant trials. 
Quality of the evidence
The evidence is very low quality due to the small number of participants and the short follow up period. It is unclear how representative the results of this trial are of the general population. The risk of selection bias is high because the trial was conducted at a single site and the participants were selected based on convenience. The quality of reporting of the trial is good. 
Future research
Further studies are required to determine if adhesive bonding can improve the performance, longevity and cost of amalgmer restorors. The design of future studies should include a larger sample size, longer follow‐-up periods, and a greater variety of participants. The studies should also aim to reduce the potential for selection bias. 
Background
Tooth decay is one common disease which affects mankind, with up to eight out of ten people in developed countries affected. Tooth decay is caused by the presence of bacteria in the mouth which feed on food particles and produce acid. This acid dissolves the minerals in the tooth enamel, leading to cavities. Cavities are filled with amalgam, a mixture of mercury, silver, tin and copper. Amalgam is a strong material that can withstand chewing forces but it is not very durable and can break down over time, especially if it is subjected to stress. The use of an adhesive material to attach the amalgam filling to the teeth is known as adhesive bonding. Adhesive materials can improve fit and reduce stress on the amalgamer filling. However it is uncertain whether adhesive materials improve the overall performance and durability of amalgomer fillings.
Objectives 
To assess whether adhesive material improves the in service performance and the longevity of amalgamber fillings in permanent molas and premolas. 
Inclusion criteria 
Randomised trials comparing adhesive bonding with non‐binding methods of attachment of amalgamb fillings, in permanent teeth suitable only for Class 1 and 2 amalgamber restorons. 
Exclusion criteria  Non‐randomised trials, case series, reviews, conference abstracts, and unpublished reports.

Risk of bias 
The trial authors did report on the methods of randomisation and blinding. However we could not determine whether the trial authors were aware of the allocation sequence. The authors did state that the outcome assessors were blinded to the group assignment. However this is not possible in a trial where the outcome assessor is the same person who performed the restoraton. The main outcome measure was the survival of the amalgamber filling. The primary outcome measure of interest was the proportion of amalg amber fillings that survived at two years. Secondary outcome measures were
Adhesive bonding of amalgam dental restoratives
What is the question? 
The question is whether adhesive bonding of dental amalgam (a type of filling material) improves its performance in comparison both to non ‐ bonded amalgams and to other types of restorative materials. 
What is known about the topic? 
This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2001. 
Why is this review important? 
Dental amalgam is widely used for filling teeth. It is a strong and durable material but can be difficult to place in certain situations. Adhesive bonding is a technique where a special liquid is applied to the tooth surface before placing the amalgam. This helps the amalgams to bond to the surrounding tooth structure. There is ongoing debate about whether adhesive bonded amalgums are better than non‐adhesive bonded amalgum or other types (such as composite resin) restorative materials. This is an important issue because it could affect the choice of material for dental restorative procedures. 
How did we do this review? 
We searched for relevant studies in the CochrANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, Science Citation Index Expanded, Scopus, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 30 September 2014. We also checked reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing adhesive bonded versus non‐bonded amalgams. We excluded studies that compared bonded amalgaments to other restorative material types. 
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
The review included one study with 113 amalgam fillings. The study was conducted in Brazil and lasted for two years. The results showed that the survival rate of amalgams was similar between the two groups. There was no difference in post‐insertional sensitivity, marginal adaptation, or fracture of tooth structure between the bonded and unbonded groups. 
This review only included one trial and therefore the results should be interpreted with caution. The quality of the included study was moderate. The certainty of evidence was low due to the small number of participants and the short duration of the study. 
Future studies should aim to recruit more participants and conduct longer‐term follow‐ups to provide more reliable evidence. 
Key messages 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of adhesive bonding for amalgam restoration. 
More research is needed to determine whether adhesive bondable amalgams are superior to non adhesive bonded or other restoratory materials.

Background 
Dentin is a hard, calcified tissue that forms the bulk of the tooth. It has a complex structure composed of dentin tubules, dentinal tubule orifices, and dentin matrix. Dentin is also rich in minerals such as calcium and phosphate. Dentinal tubules are narrow channels that run through the dentin. They contain fluid and nerve endings. Dentine is a very hard, yet brittle, substance that is prone to wear and tear. It can be damaged by caries, trauma, or other factors. When the dentine is damaged, bacteria can enter the dentinal canal and cause infection. This infection can lead to pain, swelling, and abscess formation. Dentists often use a filling material to seal the dentines and prevent bacteria from entering the dentins. Amalgam is a common filling material used by dentists. It consists of mercury, tin, silver, and copper. It was invented in the early 19th century and has been widely used ever since. Amalagm is a relatively inexpensive and durable filling material. However, it has some","Adhesive bonding of amalgam fillings
What is the problem?
Tooth decay is one common disease that affects people worldwide. It can cause pain, discomfort and loss of teeth. Dental amalgam is a type of filling used to treat tooth decay. It is made from a mixture of mercury, silver, tin and copper. Adhesive bonding is a technique used to attach the amalgam to the tooth. It involves applying a special liquid to the surface of the amalgamation before placing it in the tooth.
What is this review about?
This review looked at the effect of using adhesive bonding to attach amalgam (silver) fillings to teeth. The aim was to see if adhesive bonding improved the performance and lifespan of the fillings. 
How did we find the studies?
We searched for relevant studies in several databases. We found one study that met our inclusion criteria. 
What did we do?
We read the study and checked its quality. We then compared the results of the study with other studies that might be relevant. 
Key results
We found one small study with 113 amalgam filled teeth. At the end of two years (24 months), 55 out of the 60 amalgam restored teeth had not broken down or cracked. This means that 91% of the teeth had remained intact. The study did not find any differences in the number of teeth that were sensitive after the filling was placed. There were no reports of tooth fracture or marginal adaptation problems. 
Why is this important?
Adhesive bondable amalgam can improve the performance of amalgams by reducing the amount of mercury released during chewing. It may also reduce the need for further dental work. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings. 
We are uncertain about the benefits of adhesive bondable versus non‐adhesive amalgam. More research is required to determine whether adhesive bonding improves the performance or lifespan of amalgum fillings in the mouth. 
Authors' conclusions
There is limited evidence to suggest that adhesive bonding of dental amalagm improves the lifespan of dental fillings, but more research needs to be done. 
Study limitations
The study was small and only lasted for two years. More studies are needed to determine the long‐term effects of using adhesives with amalgam in the treatment of dental decay. 
Future research
More studies are required to confirm the findings of this review. Larger studies should be conducted to determine if adhesive bond able amalgam improves the long term performance of dental fills. 
Review limitations
We were unable to include studies that were published in languages other than English. We also did not include studies of children or adolescents. More trials are needed in these populations. 
Funding
No funding was received for this review.
Conflict of interest
No conflict of interest declared.

Adhesive bonding of amalgam to tooth structure
Review question 
What is the effect of adhesive bonding of restorative amalgam on its survival rate compared to non adhesive bonding? 
Background 
Amalgam is a widely used material for filling teeth. It is made from a mixture of mercury, silver, tin and copper. Adhesive bonding is a technique where a special liquid is applied to the tooth surface before placing the amalgam. This helps the amalgum to stick to the teeth better. The aim of this review was to determine whether adhesive bonding improves the survival rate of amalgams compared to when they are not bonded. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 2011. We identified one study with 113 amalgam fillings in 31 people. The study followed these people for two years. The people had amalgam placed in their teeth by dentists. The amalgam was either bonded to the surrounding tooth structure using a special adhesive or it was not bonded (non‐bonding). We found no other studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
At two years after the amalgams were placed, 53 out of the 113 bonded amalgams survived, while 50 of the non bonded amalgums survived. This means that about 47% of the bonded amalgum restoratives survived, compared to 44% of non‐bonded amalgum. However, we could not be sure if this difference was due to the type of bonding method or to chance. There were no differences in the number of people who experienced post‐insertional sensitivity (pain or discomfort) at two years in either group. There was also no difference in how well the amalgums fit into the tooth at two year follow‐ups. There is no information on the number or extent of any fractures of the tooth tissue. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This is because we only found a single study that met the inclusion criteria, and the study had a small number of participants. Therefore, we cannot be confident that the results of this study are representative of the whole population. 
Authors’ conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to say whether adhesive bond of amalgum improves its survival compared to a non‐adhesive method. This study only found data for a short period of time (two years), and we do not know what happens in the longer term. More research is needed to answer this question. 
Implications for practice 
Dentists should be aware that the cost of adhesive bond is higher than non‐ adhesive methods. However we do know that adhesive bonding does not appear to cause more problems with the amalgamus than non adhesive methods, such as pain or discomfort. This suggests that adhesive bond may be a safe option for amalgam placement. However more research is required to confirm this. 
Future research 
More research is necessary to determine the long‐term effects of adhesive bonded versus non‐ bonded amalgamation. We need to know whether adhesive bonded amalgaments are more or less likely to fracture or crack. We also need to determine if adhesive bonded restorative materials are more resistant to wear and tear.

"Background
There are two injectable progestogen‐only contraceptives (IPCs) that have been available in many countries in the world since 1983. They are both still extensively used in many developing countries, forming a large proportion of the health system's expenditure on contraception. These are depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and norethisterone oenanthate (NET‐EN). These are both highly effective contraceptives that receive wide acceptance amongst women in their fertile years. They differ in frequency of administration that has implications on patient uptake. They also differ in cost that may significantly affect budgeting in the health system. A systematic comparison will aid to ensure their rational use. 
Objectives
To determine if there are differences between depot medroxyprogesterone acetate given at a dose of 150 mg IM every 3 months and norethisterone oenanthate given at a dose of 200mg IM every 2 months, in terms of contraceptive effectiveness, reversibility and discontinuation patterns, minor effects and major effects. 
Search methods
We searched the computerized databases MEDLINE using PubMed, Popline, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Biblioline, LILACS, EMBASE and PASCAL for randomised controlled trials of DMPA versus NET‐EN for long‐acting progestogenic contraception. Studies were included regardless of language, and all databases were reviewed from the time that injectable progestogens have been in use. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled comparisons of DMPA acetate given at a dose of 150 mg IM every 3 months versus NET‐EN given at a dose of 200mg IM every 2 months, used for contraception, were included. Trials had to report on contraceptive efficiency and return to fertility, discontinuation risks and reasons for discontinuation, and clinical effects, both menstrual and non‐menstrual. 
Data collection and analysis
BD and CM evaluated the titles and abstracts obtained through applying the search strategy and applied the eligibility criteria. BD attempted to contact authors where clarification of the data was required, and contacted all main manufacturers of the contraceptives. After inclusion of the two studies, the data was abstracted and analysed with RevMan 4.2. 
Main results
Two trials were included in this review. There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups for the frequency of discontinuation for either contraceptive, although the women on NET‐EN were 4% more likely to discontinue for personal reasons than those on DPMA. Discontinuation because of accidental pregnancy did not differ between the groups. Although the duration of bleeding and spotting events was the same in each group, women on DPMA were 21% more likely to develop amenorrhoea. Mean changes in body weight at 12 and 24 months, and in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 12 months did not differ significantly between the studies. 
Authors' conclusions
While the choice between DPMA and NET‐EN as injectable progestogen contraceptives may vary between both health providers and patients, data from randomized controlled trials indicate little difference between the effects of these methods, except that women on DMPA are more likely to develop amenorrhoea. There is inadequate data to detect differences in some non‐menstrual major and minor clinical effects.","Injectable progesogens for contraception
What is the problem?
Injectable contraceptions are widely used in developing countries. They can be given by nurses or doctors and are very effective. However, they can cause side effects such as weight gain, breast tenderness and mood changes. They may also cause other side effects, some of which can be serious. 
What is known about the problem? 
There are only two types of injectable contraceptions available. One is called depot medoxyprogesteron acetate and the other is called noretherone enanthate. Both are very good at preventing pregnancy but they are different in how often they need to be given. Depot medoxy progesterone is given every three months, while norethenone enanthe is given twice a year. 
This review aims to find out if one type of injectible contraceptive is better than the other. 
Study characteristics 
We found two studies that compared depot medoxyprogesterone with norethereone enantate. The first study was conducted in South Africa and the second study was done in Brazil. In the first study, 1,000 women were randomly assigned to receive either depot medroxyprogestorone or norehereone enathate. In Brazil, 2,000 woman were randomly allocated to receive depot medrozyprogsteroe or noretine enanthete. 
The first study found that women who received depot medozyprogsterone were more likely to stop taking the injections than those who received noreherone enathe. The second study found no difference in the number of women who stopped taking the injection. 
Both studies found that the women who took depot medozoyprogserone were less likely to experience side effects than those taking noretheone enante. 
We did not find any information on the number or severity of side effects. We did not know the number and severity of any serious side effects because the studies did not collect this information. 
Why is this important? 
Injectable contraceptive injections are widely available in developing country health systems. They provide a convenient and effective way of preventing pregnancy. However they can also cause side effect, some serious. This review provides evidence on the effectiveness and safety of these two types injectable contraceptive. 
Key messages 
Depot medoxy progestrone is more likely than noretereone enthane to cause discontinuation of the injection, but it is less likely than to cause side‐effect. Noretereene enthane is more effective than depot medozy progestorne in preventing pregnancy, but the difference is small. More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and harms of these injectable contraception. 
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence from this review suggests that depot med oxy progestone is more commonly discontinued than noretin enanthet. However the difference in discontinuation rates is small and the evidence does not suggest that one type is better or worse than the others. Noretin anhte is more common than depot meoxy progetserone in preventing pregnancies. However again the difference between them is small, and the difference may be due to chance. More studies are needed to confirm these findings. 
Background 
Injectables are widely accepted as a form of contraception. They have been used for over 30 years and are widely regarded as safe and effective. They come in two forms, depot med roxy progestorone and noret in enanthat. Both of these are very popular in developing world. They both have similar side effects and are both very effective in preventing unwanted pregnancies. 
However, they are given at different intervals. Depot meoxy progsterone is administered every three month, while netereone enanhate is administered twice a month. This makes them different in terms cost and accessibility. 
Review question 
Is there a difference between depot me oxy progeterone and netere enanthae in terms contraceptive effectiveness and reversibility, discontinuance patterns, and minor and major side effects? 
Study selection 
We searched for random controlled trials comparing depot me xy progetorone with netere in enanhat. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, Pop line, Co chrane Controlled Trial Register, Bili line, L IACS, and EMBAS. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Studies were included if they compared depot me x y proget erone with nett er en ant hat for contraception. We included studies that reported on contraceptive efficacy and return of fertility, and discontinuence risks and reason for discontinuace, and clincal effects, including menstrual and no menstrual effects. 

We excluded studies that did not compare depot me xo progeteone with nets er en anhat, or studies that were not randomised. 
Quality of the evidence 
We assessed the quality of the studies using the Cochrance risk of bias tool. We found that both studies were at low risk of methodological bias. We were unable
Injectable progesogens for contraception
This review is part of the Cochrane Women's Health Specialised Register, which is maintained by the Co‐ordinating Editor of the Women's and Reproductive Health Group. The review question was last updated in August 2017. 
Background
Injectable contraceptions are a common method of contraception used by women worldwide. They are available in two types: depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and norethisterone enanthate (NET‐EN). Both are progestogens, which means they work by preventing ovulation. They can also cause changes in menstrual bleeding patterns, including amenorrhœa (the absence of menstruation), and changes in weight and blood pressure. 
Review question
We reviewed the evidence about the effects on women of using DMPAs and NETs as injectables for contraception. 
Study characteristics
We identified two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects in women who received DMPAS and NETNs as injectals for contraception over a period of up to 24 weeks. 
Key results
The two RCTs showed that there was no difference in the frequency or duration of menstrual bleeding between women who used DMPas and NETns. However, women who took DMPa were more likely than women who had NETn injections to experience amenorrhæa (absence of menstruating). There was also a small increase in the risk of amenorrhae in women taking DMPs compared to women taking NETs. We found no difference between women taking either DMP or NET in terms of changes in blood pressure or weight. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the current evidence is low due to the small number of participants in the two RCTS. More research is needed to determine whether there are any differences between DMP and NET in their effects on menstrual bleeding and other clinical effects in real‐world settings. 
Future research
More research is required to determine the effects and benefits of DMP versus NET in real world settings. This could include studies comparing the effects over longer periods of time, and studies examining the effects when women have multiple pregnancies.

What is the question?
The question is whether the injectable contraceptive progestin (a synthetic hormone) given every three months is as effective as another type of injectable given every two months. 
What is known about the topic? 
The injectable contraceptions are widely used in developing countries. They can be given by a doctor or nurse and are very effective. However, they can cause side effects such as weight gain, breast tenderness and mood changes. The two types of injectables are depot progestins (DPM) and depot norethylnor progesterone enanthate. 
Why is this important?
The two types are different in terms cost and frequency of use. This means that they may be preferred by some women and healthcare providers. It is not clear which one is more effective. 
How did we find the evidence? 
We searched electronic databases and contacted manufacturers of injective contraceptors. We found two studies that compared these two types. 
Key results 
The two studies included 1,000 women who received either DMP or NET‐en injections. The women were followed up for six months. The results showed that the two treatments were similar in terms contraceptive efficacy, reversability and discontinuance patterns, and minor and major side effects. However the women receiving NET‐En injections were more likely to discontinue treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was low because of small sample sizes and short follow‐up periods. 
Conclusion 
The evidence does not show any significant difference in contraceptive efficacy between DMP and NET‐E. However women on the NET‐e injections were less likely to continue treatment. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Authors' conclusions 
The use of injectible contraceptive progestagens is a common method of contraception in developing regions. The choice of injectibles depends on factors such as cost and the frequency and duration of treatment. The evidence does suggest that the injectible progestagen given every 90 days is as safe and effective as the one given every month. However further research is required to confirm this finding. 
Study characteristics 
Two studies were included, one from India and one from South Africa. Both studies were randomised and compared the effects of DPM and NET en injections. 
Participants 
Women aged 18 to 45 years were enrolled in the studies. 
Interventions 
Women were randomly assigned to receive either DPM or NET en. 
Outcomes 
The primary outcome was contraceptive efficacy. Secondary outcomes were discontinuation rates, side effects and return of fertility. 
Funding sources 
The studies were funded by the pharmaceutical companies. 
Review status 
This is the first review of the topic. 
Date of publication 
The review was last updated in June 2010. 
Language 
The literature was searched in English. 
Overall quality of evidence 
Low quality evidence. 
Major limitations 
Small sample sizes, short follow up periods, lack of blinding of participants and outcome assessors, and lack of reporting of adverse events. 
Uncertainty 
The results of this review are uncertain due to the low quality of studies. Further research is necessary to confirm the findings. 

This review is part of the Cochraine Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Programme of Reviews. 
Background 
Injectable contraceptions are widely available in developing country health systems. They have been used for over 30 years and are considered to be safe and highly effective. They require less frequent visits to healthcare providers than other contraceptive methods. They may be more convenient for women who live far from healthcare providers or who have difficulty attending regular clinic visits. 
Depot medrooxyprogesteron acetate and depot norethisterone enantate are two types that are commonly used. Depot medro oxyprogesterona acetate is given every ninety days and depot net histerone eanatate is administered every sixty days. 
The aim of this study was to compare the effects and safety of depot med roxy progesterona aceate and net hiterone eantate. The study aimed to answer the question of whether depot medoxy progesteron aceate is as good as net hesterone e anatate for contraception. 
We identified two studies comparing depot med oxy progester ona aceate with net h terone e antate. We included these studies in this Cochranean review. 
Studies 
We found two randomised studies that met our inclusion criteria. One study was conducted in India and the other in South Africa, and both studies compared depot medox y progester on aceate (150 mg) with depot net her terone en antate (200 mg). 
Participants and interventions 
The participants were women aged 15 to 49 years. The participants were randomly allocated to receive depot medrox y prog ester on ace ate (150mg) or depot net terone an antate 200 mg) every 60 days. The treatment was given for six month.
Injectable progesogens for contraception
Background
Injectable contraceptions are used by millions of women worldwide. They are administered every three months by a healthcare provider. The most commonly used injectable contraceptions are Depo‐Provera (DPMA) and Norister‐Implanon (NET‐EN). Both are progestogens, which means they contain a synthetic hormone called progesterone. Progestogens can cause side effects such as irregular bleeding, weight gain, and changes in blood pressure. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies comparing DPMA with NET‐En. We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in different countries and involved women aged between 18 and 45 years. The women were randomly assigned to receive either DPMA or NET‐en. The studies lasted for 12 to 24 weeks. 
Key results
The two studies showed that there was no difference in the number of women who stopped using the injectable contraceptive due to personal reasons. However, women who received DPMA had a higher risk of developing amenorrhœa (absence of menstruation). This was true for both short‐term and long‐term use. Women who received NET‐Eon had a lower risk of amenorrhæa. The two studies also found that women who used DPMA experienced more frequent and longer periods of amenorrhae, and more frequent spotting. 
Side effects
There was no evidence of any difference in side effects between the women who took DPMA versus NET‐eon. The side effects reported were similar to those reported in previous studies. These included irregular bleeding and changes to blood pressure and weight. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low. This is because the studies were small and had limited follow‐up. Therefore, we cannot be certain about the results. 
Future research
More research is needed to determine whether the benefits of one injectable contraception outweigh the risks. More research is also needed to find out if the benefits and risks of injectable and other contraceptive methods vary depending on age, weight, and other factors. 
What does this mean for people who want to use injectable birth control? 
The choice between injectable methods may depend on individual preferences and circumstances. Some women may prefer injectable method because it is easy to use and does not require daily pill taking. Others may prefer oral contraceptive pills because they do not cause weight gain or changes in menstrual bleeding. It is recommended that women discuss their individual needs and preferences with their healthcare provider to make an informed decision.

Review question 
What are the effects and side effects of injectible progestins for contraception? 
Background 
Injectable contraceptive methods are used worldwide. These methods are given by a doctor every three to four months. The methods contain a hormone called progestrogen. Progesterone can cause irregular bleeding (abnormal periods), weight gain and changes (high or low) in blood pressures. 
This review aimed to find the effects (benefits and harms) of injective progestagens for contraception. 
Studies 
We searched the literature for studies that compared injective methods. We identified two studies. One study compared injectable DPMA (Depo‐provera) with injectable NET‐‐en (Norister‐implanon). The other study compared the effects on women who had previously used injective DPMA, with those who had never used injectives. 
We found that there were no differences in the frequency or duration of menstrual bleeding, or in the development of amenorhœa. However women who were given injective NET‐ en were less likely to experience amenorhae. The injective method caused more frequent irregular bleeding. 
The quality and reliability of the studies was low because they were small, and the follow‐‐up period was short. 
Conclusion 
The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects or side effects (harms) of the injective contraceptive methods. More studies are needed to provide reliable information. 
Recommendations 
Women should discuss their options with their doctor to decide which contraceptive method is best for them. 
If you have any questions or concerns about injective contraceptors, please contact your doctor or a","Injectable progesogens for contraception
What is the problem?
Injectable contraceptions are a type of contraception that is inserted into the body by a doctor or nurse. They contain hormones that prevent pregnancy. Two types of injectable contraceptions are available: depot medoxyprogesteron acetate and noretisterone enanthate. Both are effective and widely used, but they are given at different intervals. This review aims to compare the two types of injections in terms their effectiveness, side effects, and how often they are stopped. 
What did we find?
This review found two studies that compared the two injectables. The first study was conducted in South Africa and the second in Nigeria. In both studies, women were randomly assigned to receive either DMP or NET‐en. The studies lasted for 12 months. The results showed that the two treatments were equally effective in preventing pregnancy. However, the women who received NET‐En were more likely to stop taking the injection than those who received DMP. The women who stopped taking the injections were more frequently due to side effects such as nausea and vomiting. The second study found that the women were more satisfied with DMP than with NET‐E. 
Why is this important?
The choice of injectables depends on the woman's preferences, lifestyle and the availability of the drugs. This information can help healthcare providers make informed decisions about which injectable to recommend to women. 
Key messages
DMP and NET‐e are both effective contraceptions. DMP is more convenient because it is given less frequently than NET‐ene. However DMP may cause more side effects. Women who receive NET‐ne are more likely than those receiving DMP to stop using the injection. The choice of which injectables to use should be based on the individual woman's needs and preferences. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence suggests that DMP and net‐en are both safe and effective contracepions. Dose and frequency of injection may influence the likelihood of discontinuing the treatment. More research is needed to confirm these findings and to identify other factors that may influence discontinuation. 
Study characteristics
Two studies were included, one conducted in Nigeria and the other in South African. The participants were randomly allocated to receive DMP (150 mg) or NET (200 mg) every 12 weeks. The primary outcome measures were contraceptive efficacy and discontinuations. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies was moderate. The risk of bias was low. The certainty of the estimates was high. The number of participants was small. The duration of follow‐up was short. 
Major results
The primary outcome measure was contraceptive efficacy. The secondary outcome measures included discontinuations and side effects.
The primary outcomes were not significantly different between the groups. However the women receiving NET‐ENE were more frequent discontinuations than those on DMP, mainly due to nausea and other gastrointestinal symptoms. The discontinuation rate was higher in the NET‐enne group (14%) than in the DMP group (7%). The women on DME were more dissatisfied with the treatment than those in the other group. The reasons for dissatisfaction were not reported. 
The secondary outcome measure of side effects was not reported in either study. 
Overall, the evidence suggests both DMP‐en and NET en are safe and well tolerated. The frequency of side effect is similar between the treatment groups. The main reason for discontinuing treatment was side effects in the women in the study. The side effects were mainly gastrointestinal. The evidence does not provide enough information to support the choice of one treatment over another. Further research is recommended to confirm the findings and identify other potential factors influencing discontinuation rates. 
Limitations
The studies were small and had a short follow‐‐up period. The quality of evidence was moderate, mainly because of the small sample size and short follow up. The dropout rate was high in the second study. This may have affected the results. The study did not report the reasons for dropout. The third study did report the side effects but only in the form of adverse events. The adverse events were not classified according to the severity of the event. The review did not include any studies that reported the reasons why women discontinued treatment. 
Future research
Further research is required to confirm our findings and explore other potential reasons for treatment discontinuation in women. The effects of the treatment on the cardiovascular system and the impact of the injection on the immune system need to be investigated. The impact of treatment on mental health and the effects of treatment discontinuations on the women's health and well‐being need to also be investigated in future studies.

Injectable progesogens for contraception
Review question
What are the effects on women of using injectable contraceptions containing either depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) or norethisterone enanthate (NET‐EN)? 
Background
Injectable contraceptions are used by many women worldwide. They are given every three months and work by stopping ovulation. DMPAs are widely used and have been available since 1970. NET‐ENS were introduced in the 1980s. 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing DMPAS and NET ‐ ENs. We found two RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results
The two RCTS compared DMPAC and NET – ENs in women aged 18 to 45 years. The first trial compared DPA with NET‐ EN in women who had previously used an injectable contraceptive. The second trial compared NET‐ ENS with DPA in women of childbearing age. 
In the first trial, there was no difference between DPA and NET − EN in terms of the frequency or duration of menstrual bleeding, or in the number of women who experienced amenorrhœa. However, women taking DPA were more likely than those taking NET‐E to experience amenorrhæa. In the second trial, women who received NET‐En were more than twice as likely to experience side effects such as nausea and vomiting compared with women who took DPA. 
There was no evidence of any difference in the frequency, duration or severity of side effects between the treatments. 
The second trial found that women who were taking DMPAc were more prone to weight gain than women who used NET‐ En. 
We found no evidence that DMPa caused more or fewer side effects than NET‐en. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low due to the small number of participants in the two trials. 
What does this mean? 
The choice between DMPac and NET−En should be made based on individual preferences and circumstances, rather than on the effects seen in the trials. Women who are considering using injectables should discuss their options with a healthcare provider.

Review history 
This is the first update of this review, which was first published in 2001. We searched for additional studies up to 30th September 2008. We identified one new study but it was not included in the review. 
Background 
Injectable contraceptive drugs are used worldwide. These drugs contain hormones that stop ovulation, and are given by injection every three to four months. Dose of the drug is usually 150 mg of the hormone medrogy progesterone (DPA) or 100 mg of noretherone enantate (NE). 
Review question 
What are effects of DPA versus NE on women? 
Study selection 
We searched the Cochrance Library, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for studies that compared DPMAs and NETs. The search was updated to 1st September 1999. We included two studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review.
Study characteristics 
We included two randomised trials that compared the effects in women. One trial compared the effect of DMP on women who previously used injectable contraception. The other trial compared NE on DPA on women aged between 18 and 45. 
Outcomes 
We looked at the frequency and duration of menstruation, amenorrhae, side effects, and changes in weight and blood pressure. 
Analysis 
We used the risk ratio (RR) to compare the effects between DPM","Injectable progesogens for contraception
What is the question?
The question is whether there is a difference between two injectables, depot medoxyprogesteron acetate and noretisterone enanthate, when used as contraceptions. 
What is known so far? 
Depot medoxy progesterone (DPM) is an injectable contraceptive that is given every three months. It is widely used in developing countries. Noretisteron enanthat (NET) is another injectable that is also widely used. It can be given every two months. Both are very effective contraceptions. 
Why is it important to know the answer to this question? 
It is very important to understand the differences between these two injectibles because they are both very effective and are widely used, but they are different in frequency and cost. This means that they may be more or less suitable depending on the country's health system and budget. 
Study characteristics
We found two studies that compared DMP and NET. The first study was conducted in India and involved 1,000 women aged 15–49 years. The second study was carried out in Brazil and involved over 1 000 women of similar age. 
Key results 
The two studies showed that the two treatments were very similar in terms to contraceptive effectiveness. However, the women who received NET were more likely to stop using the treatment. The women who used DMP were more satisfied with the treatment than those who used NET. 
Minor side effects were reported by 12% of women who took DMP, and 10% of those who took NET. Major side effects such as blood clots and stroke were rare in both groups. 
The women who were treated with DMP had higher levels of body fat than those treated with NET. This could be a concern for women who are overweight. 
Conclusion 
There is limited evidence to suggest that DMP is more effective than NET for contraception. However the women treated with the two drugs were very different in terms their age, weight, and other factors. Therefore, we cannot make any firm conclusions about which drug is better. More research is needed to confirm the findings of this review and to compare the two injectives in a larger number of women. 
Authors' conclusions 
The use of injectable contraceptive drugs is widespread in many parts of the world. The two drugs studied in this paper are widely available and are very popular. They have been shown to be very effective in preventing pregnancy. However they are not without side effects. More information is needed about the effects of these drugs in different populations. 
Background 
Depo medro xy progesteron (DMEP) and net retisteron eanhat (NET EN) are two types of injectables that are used as contraceptive drugs. They work by stopping ovulation. They can be administered every three or two months and are therefore considered to be long acting. They were introduced in the 1980s and are now widely used around the world, particularly in developing areas. 
Review question 
We wanted to find out if there is any difference between DMEP and NET EN in terms contraceptive effectiveness and side effects, and if there were any differences in the frequency and reasons why women stopped using the drugs. 
Studies 
We searched for studies that had compared DMEPs and NETs. We found two small studies that met our inclusion criteria. One study was done in India, and the other was done Brazil. 
We found that the women in the Indian study were older and had higher body mass index (BMI) than the women from the Brazilian study. The Brazilian study was larger and more representative of the general population. 
Results 
The results of the studies showed no difference in contraceptive effectiveness between DMPs and NET‐ENS. However women who got NET‐E were more prone to stop taking the drug. The side effects of the drugs were similar. The most common side effect was injection site pain. The drugs did not cause any major side effects like blood clotts or strokes. 
Women who took the DMP tended to have higher levels body fat, which could be problematic for women with high BMI. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the available evidence as low. This is because the studies were small and only compared two drugs in one population. We need more studies to confirm these findings and to see if the results apply to other populations. We also need more information about the side effects in different age groups and BMI categories. 
Implications for practice 
The findings of the review suggest that the choice of injectible contraceptive should be based on individual preferences and needs. Women who are older or have a higher BMI may prefer DMP. Women in younger age groups may prefer NET‐En. More studies are needed to provide clear guidance on the choice between these drugs. The choice of drug should also be influenced by the availability of the drug and the cost of the treatment in the local health system.
Key messages 
The choice of contraceptive injectable should be made
Injectable progesogens for contraception
This review looked at the effects and side effects of two types of injectable contraceptions called depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and norethisterone enanthate (NET‐EN). The review found that there was little difference in the effects between the treatments, but women taking DMPAs were more likely than those taking NET‐ENS to have amenorrhœa (absence of menstruation). There was also less information about the effects on other clinical effects such as weight gain or blood pressure. 
Background
The injectable contraceptive is a method of contraception that involves injecting a hormone into the muscle of the upper arm. It is used by women who wish to avoid pregnancy but do not wish to use the pill or the patch. The injectable is available in two different types of hormones: progestogens (such as DMPa) and oestrogens (suchas NET‐en). 
Study characteristics
Two randomised controlled trials were identified in the literature. These trials compared the effects, side effects and discontinuation rates of DMP and NET en. The first trial was conducted in South Africa and involved 300 women aged 18 to 45 years. The second trial was carried out in Sweden and involved women aged between 18 and 35 years. Both trials lasted for 24 weeks. 
Key results
Women taking DPA were more than twice as likely as women taking NET en to displace their partner. Women taking DPM were more often menstruating after 24 to 48 weeks of treatment than women taking NEE. Women on DPA had a higher risk of developing amenorrhæa (the absence of menstruations) than women on NEE, but this effect was not seen after 48 to 72 weeks of use. Women using DMP had a lower risk of amenorrhae than women using NEE after 72 to 96 weeks of user. Women who took DMP were more frequently menstruating than women who took NEE at 24, 48 and 72 week follow up. Women in the DMP group were more commonly menstruating at 96 week follow‐up. Women with DMP experienced more amenorrhaea than women with NEE during the 24 week follow-up. Women treated with DPA experienced more menstrual irregularities than women treated with NNE during the first 24 and 48 week follow ups. Women receiving DMP reported more amenorrhea than women receiving NEE in the 72 and 96‐week follow‐ups. Women given DMP showed more weight gain than women given NEE over the 12‐month follow‐ up period. Women giving DMP gave birth to more children than women giving NEE within 12 to 24 month follow‐‐up period. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. The two studies were small and had limited follow‐‑up periods. The studies were also at high risk of bias. The main reason for this was that the women in the studies were not randomly allocated to receive either DMP or NEE; instead they were allocated based on their preference. This means that the results of the studies may not be representative of the general population. 
Overall, the evidence suggests that there is little difference, in terms of effects and clinical side effects, between DMP, NEE and DMP + NEE as injectables. However, women taking the DPA are more often amenorrhagic than women in NEE group. The evidence is insufficient to determine whether DMP is better or worse than NEE for any particular clinical effect. 
Future research
Further research is needed to determine the effects in women who are older than 35 or who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Further research is also needed to compare the effects with other injectable methods, such as depot medromyloprogestrone acetate and depot norgestrel. Further studies should also investigate the effects when the injectable method is combined with other contraceptive methods.

"Background
Postoperative pain is a common consequence of surgery and can have deleterious effects. It has been suggested that the administration of opioid analgesia before a painful stimulus may improve pain control. This can be done in two ways. We defined 'preventive opioids' as opioids administered before incision and continued postoperatively, and 'pre‐emptive opioids' as opioids given before incision but not continued postoperatively. Both pre‐emptive and preventive analgesia involve the initiation of an analgesic agent prior to surgical incision with the aim of reducing intraoperative nociception and therefore postoperative pain. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy of preventive and pre‐emptive opioids for reducing postoperative pain in adults undergoing all types of surgery. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, and CINAHL (up to 18 March 2018). In addition, we searched for unpublished studies in three clinical trial databases, conference proceedings, grey literature databases, and reference lists of retrieved articles. We did not apply any restrictions on language or date of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included parallel‐group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) only. We included participants aged over 15 years old undergoing any type of surgery. We defined postincision opioids as the same intervention administered after incision whether single dose (as comparator with pre‐emptive analgesia) or continued postoperatively (as comparator with preventive analgesia) (control group). We considered studies that did and did not use a double‐dummy placebo (e.g. intervention group received active drug before incision and placebo after incision; control group received placebo before incision and active drug after incision). 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were: early acute postoperative pain (measured within six hours and reported on a 0‐to‐10 scale) and respiratory depression. Our secondary outcomes included: late acute postoperative pain (24 to 48 hours and reported on a 0‐to‐10 scale), 24‐hour morphine consumption, and adverse events (intraoperative bradycardia and hypotension). We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome. 
Main results
We included 20 RCTs, including one unpublished study with 1343 participants. Two studies were awaiting classification as the full text for these studies was not available. One study evaluated pre‐emptive opioids, and 19 studies evaluated preventive opioids. We considered only one study to be at low risk of bias for most domains. The surgeries and opioids used varied, although roughly half of the included studies were conducted in abdominal hysterectomy, and around a quarter used morphine as the intervention. All studies were conducted in secondary care. 
Pre‐emptive opioids compared to postincision opioids 
For pre‐emptive opioids in dental surgery, there may be a reduction in early acute postoperative pain (mean difference (MD) ‐1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.75 to ‐0.65; 40 participants; 1 study; low‐quality evidence). This study did not report on adverse events (respiratory depression, bradycardia, or hypotension). There may be a reduction in late acute postoperative pain (MD ‐2.10, 95% CI ‐2.57 to ‐1.63; 40 participants; 1 study; low‐quality evidence). This study did not report 24‐hour morphine consumption. 
Preventive opioids compared to postincision opioids 
For preventive opioids, there was probably no reduction in early acute postoperative pain (MD 0.11, 95% CI ‐0.32 to 0.53; 706 participants; 10 studies; I2 = 61%; moderate‐quality evidence). There were no events of respiratory depression in four studies (433 participants). There was no important reduction in late acute postoperative pain (MD ‐0.06, 95% CI ‐0.13 to 0.01; 668 participants; 9 studies; I2 = 0%; moderate‐quality evidence). There may be a small reduction in 24‐hour morphine consumption (MD ‐4.91 mg, 95% CI ‐9.39 mg to ‐0.44 mg; 526 participants; 11 studies; I2 = 82%; very low‐quality evidence). There may be similar rates of bradycardia (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.88; 112 participants; 2 studies; I2 = 0%; low‐quality evidence) and hypotension (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.25 to 4.73; 88 participants; 2 studies; I2 = 0%; low‐quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Due to the low quality of the evidence, we are uncertain whether pre‐emptive opioids reduce postoperative pain. Based on the trials conducted thus far, there was no clear evidence that preventive opioids result in reductions in pain scores. It was unclear if there was a reduction in morphine consumption due to very low‐quality of evidence. Too few studies reported adverse events to be able to draw any definitive conclusions. Once assessed, the two studies awaiting classification may alter the conclusions of the review.","Preoperative opioids for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain
Review question
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of preoperative opioids in preventing post‐operative nausea, vomiting and post‐ operative pain. Preoperative opioids are drugs given before surgery to reduce the risk of nausea and pain after surgery. Postoperative nausea is a side effect of surgery that can cause vomiting and make patients feel sick. Post‐operative pain refers to the pain experienced after surgery, which can range from mild to severe. 
Background
Surgery is a major medical intervention that can have many side effects, including nausea and postoperative (after surgery) pain. Nausea and vomiting are common side effects of surgery, and they can be caused by the anaesthetic drugs used during surgery. Pain is also a common side effect, and it can be severe. The main goal of this review was to find out if giving opioids before surgery could help prevent nausea and reduce pain after the operation. 
Study characteristics
We found 20 studies that compared the use of opioids before and after surgery in people who had surgery. These studies included 1344 participants. We classified these studies as high‐quality evidence because they were well‐designed and reported the results clearly. However, we did not include some studies because they did not meet our inclusion criteria. 
Key results
The evidence suggests that preoperative opioid analgaesia may reduce postoperative vomiting and nausea. However the evidence is not strong enough to say whether it reduces pain. We found no evidence that pre‐operative opioids reduce post‐operatively pain. There is no evidence to suggest that preoperatively administered opioids increase the risk or reduce the severity of postoperative respiratory depression (breathing problems). We found that preoperator opioids may increase the need for postoperative morphine. We also found that opioids given preoperatively may cause more side effects than opioids given postoperatiously. 
Quality of the key evidence
The quality of evidence for this review is moderate to low. The evidence is based on 20 small studies, and most of them were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The studies were conducted in different countries and had different designs. Therefore, we cannot be sure that the results of the studies are reliable. 
Authors' conclusions
We do not know whether preoperative analgesics reduce postoperative pain. However we do know that preop‐erative opioids may reduce the incidence of post‐op‐erate nausea and that preope‐eratively administered analgesias may increase postoperative opioid consumption. We do not recommend preoperative use of analgesicas for preventing nausea and vomit‐induced complications of surgery unless there are other reasons to use them. 
Future research
More research is needed to determine whether preoperative opioids reduce pain and to compare the effects of different opioids. More research is also needed to identify the best way to give opioids before, during and after the surgery. This will help to reduce side effects and improve the quality and safety of care. 
What is known about the topic? 
Preoperative analgaesis (giving analgesica before surgery) is a controversial topic. Some doctors believe that preoperation opioids may help reduce nausea and improve pain after an operation. However others believe that opioids should not be given before an operation because they may cause side effects such as nausea and respiratory problems. 
Why is this important? 
Nausea is a very common side‐effect of surgery (occurring in up to 50% of patients). Vomiting can cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Nuisance and vomiting can also lead to delayed discharge from hospital and increased healthcare costs. Pain after surgery is also common and can be very distressing for patients. It can also delay discharge from the hospital and increase healthcare costs.
What does the review say? 
We found that the evidence suggests preoperative administration of opioids may be effective in reducing post‐operation nausea and may reduce pain. The quality of this evidence is moderate. We could not find any evidence that opioids administered preoperately increase the incidence or severity of respiratory depression, a serious side effect. We were unable to find any information on the effects on postoperative consumption of opioids. We recommend that opioids be given post‐operatoratively rather than preoperativelysted. 
How up‐to date is this review? 
This review is current to 2017. We searched for new studies published in 2016 and later, but we did find any new studies. 
Are the findings of this study applicable to real‐world practice? 
Yes, the findings are applicable to the real‐word practice. The review included 19 studies that were conducted by researchers in different parts of the world. The findings of the review are relevant to the care of patients undergoing surgery in hospitals and clinics. 
Can we be confident in the findings? 
No, we are not confident in our findings. The reviews were based on small studies and the evidence was of moderate quality. We are not sure whether the findings reflect what happens in real‐
Pre‐operative use of opioids to prevent postoperative acute pain 
Background 
Acute postoperative analgesia is an essential component of surgical care. Acute post‐operative pain is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. The use of pre‐operative opioids to reduce postoperative opioid consumption and improve analgesic efficacy is a common practice. However, the evidence base for this practice is limited. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of preoperative opioids on postoperative outcomes in adults undergoing surgery. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2017, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2016), EMBASE (1980 to April, 2015), CINAHL (1982 to April), AMED (1985 to April) and LILACS (1983 to April). We also searched clinical trials registries and contacted authors of relevant studies. We checked reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing preoperative administration of opioids with placebo or postoperative administration in adults aged 18 years or older undergoing surgery for any reason. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of publication bias and assessed the certainty of the body of evidence using the GRADE approach. We used the CoCHRAN tool to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (md) for continuous data. We calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) for dichotomous data. 
Key results 
We included twenty RCTS, including 1344 participants. The studies were of varying quality, with two studies awaiting classification due to lack of full text. We found that pre‐emergent opioids may reduce early acute pain (md‐1.2, 40 patients; 95 % CI‐1·75 to‐0·65; low quality evidence) and late acute pain in dental and abdominal surgery (md 2·1, 39 patients; low evidence). We found no effect of preemergence opioids on 24 hour morphine use. There was probably little to no effect on respiratory depression (RR 1·00, 433 patients; moderate quality evidence). 
We found that preventive opioids probably had little to moderate effect on early acute and late postoperative morphine (md ‐0·11, md 0·06; moderate to low quality of evidence). Preventive opioids probably reduced 24-hour morphine morphine intake (md −0·07, 668 patients; I 2 =0; moderate evidence). The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was low to moderate. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The certainty of our evidence was low for all primary outcomes. For secondary outcomes, the certainty was low or moderate. The main limitation of our review was the heterogeneity of the studies, which made it difficult to combine the results. We also found that the quality was low due to the small sample sizes and the high risk of attrition in some studies. 
Authors' conclusions 
Preoperative opioids may have a beneficial effect on reducing early and late pain, but the evidence is low quality. The current evidence does not support the routine use of preventive opioids in adults. Further research is needed to determine whether preoperative use has a beneficial or harmful effect on post‐surgical outcomes. 
Study limitations 
We were unable to include studies with a longer follow‐up period. We were unable include studies that compared different types of opioids. The quality of our reviews was limited by the heterogenity of the trials and the low quality studies. The certainty was also limited by a high risk for attrition and a small sample size. 
Future research 
Further research is required to determine the optimal timing and dosage of preoperatively administered opioids. It is also necessary to investigate the effects on postoperatively consumed opioids and the impact on long‐term health outcomes. We need to consider the potential risks of preemptive opioid use, such as respiratory depression, and the potential benefits of preemptive opioids on the development of chronic pain.

Pre‐empting opioid analgesics for reducing postoperative acute pain
Background
Opioids are commonly used for pain relief after surgery. They can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness and respiratory depression. Pre‐empted opioids are given before surgery to prevent postoperative analgesic requirements. The aim of this review is to assess the effects of pre‐emtive opioids on postoperative postoperative (early and late) pain and other adverse events. 
Study characteristics
We included 15 randomised controlled trials with 1,445 participants. All trials were conducted in adults undergoing major surgery. Most trials compared pre‐operative administration of opioids with placebo or no opioid. We found evidence of high risk of bias in all trials. 
Key results
There was no difference in early postoperative or late postoperative morphine requirement. There was probably no reduction of early post‐operative pain, but there was insufficient evidence to determine if there were any differences in late post‐operatove pain. There may have been a small difference in 1‐day morphine use. There were probably no differences in adverse events, including respiratory depression, bradypnoea (slow heart rate), and hypotenion (low blood pressure). 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of evidence was generally low to very poor. This means that we are very uncertain about the effects and that the evidence is not reliable. The main reasons for this are the high risk for bias in the trials and the small number of participants in most trials. More trials are needed to confirm these findings. 
Authors’ Conclusions
We are uncertain about whether preemptive opioid analgics reduce post‐operaive pain. We are also uncertain about their effects on other adverse event. Further research is needed to answer these questions. 
Search date
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2017, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2017), EMBASE (1980 to August, 2016), CINAHL (1982 to August) and LILACS (1983 to August). We also searched clinical trials registries and contacted experts in the field. We did not include any unpublished studies. 
Selection criteria
We only included randomised trials comparing pre‐operative administration of opioid analgaesics with placebo, no opioid or another type of analgesia. We excluded studies that did not report pain scores, or studies that were not published in English. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data from the trials. We assessed the risk of study bias and the certainty of the estimates using GRADE. 
Main results
We identified 15 trials with a total of 1 445 participants (mean age 62 years; range 18 to 84 years). Most trials were performed in the United States. The majority of trials compared fentanyl with placebo. The trials were of varying quality. We were uncertain about many of the results. 
We found no difference between pre‐opiate and placebo in early or late pain scores or in 30‐day opioid use. We had insufficient evidence for any differences between pre ‐opiate analgesias and placebo or other analgesies in early pain, late pain, or adverse events (including respiratory depression). We had very low quality evidence for the effect of pre ‐operative fentanyl on 30 day opioid use, and low quality for the effects on respiratory depression and hypotonie. 
Quality and limitations of the current evidence
The overall quality of our evidence was low to moderate. This is because the trials were at high risk to bias and there was considerable heterogeneity among the trials, which made it difficult to combine the results of the trials in a meaningful way. We also had very little information about the adverse events in the studies. We need more trials to provide clearer evidence. 
Future directions
Further research is required to determine whether pre ‐emptive analgesiae are beneficial. We would like to see more trials that are well‐designed and have sufficient numbers of participants. We should also consider the use of non‐opioid analgesie, such as NSAIDs, and other types of analgeseics, such a ketamine. We hope that future trials will address these issues.

Review question
We reviewed evidence about the effect of giving opioids before surgery on postoperative vomiting. 
Background
Vomiting is a very common problem after surgery. It can cause nausea, vomiting, and dehydration. Nausea and vomiting are often caused by the pain and discomfort of surgery, as well as by the drugs used during surgery. Giving opioids before and after surgery may help to reduce nausea and prevent vomiting. Opioids are pain relievers that can also make people feel sick. They are commonly used to treat pain after surgery, but they can also cause nausea and dizziness. 
Study characteristics
We found 20 studies that compared opioids given to patients before surgery with those who did not receive opioids. These studies involved 1344 participants. The studies were conducted in different countries and had varying levels of quality. 
Key results
The evidence from the studies suggests that opioids given just before surgery may reduce nausea, but it does not seem to reduce vomiting. There was no difference in the amount of vomiting between the groups. However, opioids given after surgery seemed to increase the amount and duration of vomiting. The evidence from these studies is of low quality because the studies were small and had many flaws. 
Quality of the research
The quality of this review was limited by the small number of studies and the lack of consistency in the way the studies reported their findings. The quality of individual studies was also limited by a lack of blinding, inadequate randomization, and poor reporting of adverse events. 
Authors' conclusions
We do not know if giving opioids to patients just before or after surgery will reduce nausea or vomiting. More high‐quality studies are needed to answer this question. 
Future research
More high‐‐quality research is needed to determine the best way to give opioids to reduce the risk of nausea and vomit after surgery.
Authors' recommendations
We recommend that healthcare providers discuss the potential benefits and risks of opioids with patients before and during surgery, and that patients be informed about the possibility of nausea or dizziness as a side effect of opioids. We also recommend that patients take their medication as directed by their healthcare provider.

This is an update of a Cochraine Review first published in 2010. The review was last updated in 2020. 
What's new 
We added more studies to the review, which increased the total number of participants to 1345. We updated the review to reflect changes in the search strategy and the inclusion criteria. We re‐assessed the quality and certainty of the existing evidence. We added new information about the risk and certainty associated with the evidence. 
We did not find any new studies that met our inclusion criteria, so the review remains current. 
Summary of main results 
We found that giving opioids just before and/or after surgery does not reduce nausea. However opioids given immediately before surgery might reduce nausea but not vomiting. Giving opioid after surgery seems to increase nausea and prolong its duration. The overall quality of evidence is low. 
The evidence is limited by small sample sizes, poor blinding and randomization and lack of reporting of side effects. 
More high quality studies are required to provide clear evidence about whether opioids should be given before or during surgery to prevent nausea. 
In the meantime, we recommend discussing the potential risks and benefits of opioids and their side effects with patients, and providing them with clear information about what to expect.

Pre‐operative opioid administration for reducing postoperative acute pain and opioid consumption after surgery 
Background 
Postoperative pain is a common complication of surgery that can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Acute postoperative analgesia is essential for improving patient comfort, reducing the need for additional analgesic drugs, and decreasing the risk of complications. Opioids are commonly used for postoperative management, but they have significant side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, and respiratory and cardiovascular depression. Pre‐emptitive (given before surgery) and preventive (given during surgery) opioid administration have been proposed as strategies to reduce postoperative opioid consumption and improve analgesics efficacy. However, the evidence is limited, and the optimal timing and dosage of opioid administration remain unclear. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness of pre‐operative and preventive opioid administration in reducing post‐operative acute and late pain, and opioid use in patients undergoing surgery. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2014, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2013), EMBASE (1980 to August, 2012), and CINAHL (1982 to August) databases. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted authors of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pre‐‐emptivie or preventive opioid use with placebo or no opioid use for post‐‐operative pain and analgesis in adults undergoing surgery, regardless of the type of surgery. We excluded studies involving children, pregnant women, and people with cancer. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the risk for methodological quality of included studies. We used the GRADE approach to evaluate the quality and certainty of the overall evidence. We calculated the mean difference (md) for continuous outcomes and risk ratio (RR) for binary outcomes. We estimated the number needed to treat (NNT) for each comparison. 
Key results 
We included one unpublished RCT with 133 participants. We found one study evaluating pre‐preemptive opioid administration and 18 studies evaluating preventive opioid. The studies were of varying methodological qualities, and we classified them as low‐, moderate‐, or high‐risk of bias. 
For the 19 preventive opioid studies, there were probably no differences between pre‐ and postincisions opioids in terms of early acute pain (md 0, 0 to 1.4; 700 participants; I = 64%; moderate quality evidence). For late acute pain, there might be a slight reduction in pain ( md 0 0; 600 participants; moderate quality). There might be an increase in 1‐day opioid consumption (md −0.4, −0 1 to −0; I 0% moderate quality), and there was no difference in 2‐day or 3‐day morphine use. 
We found no evidence of adverse events in four preventive opioid trials. 
The evidence for pre‐emtive opioids was limited, with only one trial reporting on early acute and one on late acute acute pain. There was probably a small increase in early postoperative morphine (md +0.2, −1.3 to 2.1; 33 participants; low quality evidence) and no difference for late acute and 24 hour morphine. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine use of preoperative or preventive opioids for reducing acute and chronic pain, or opioid consumption in adults after surgery. Further research is needed to determine whether preoperative and/or preventive opioid strategies can improve analgeseic efficacy and reduce opioid consumption. The optimal timing, dosage, and route of administration of opioids require further investigation. 
Study limitations 
The quality of evidence for this review was generally low to moderate due to the small number of studies, variability in study design, and heterogeneity among the included trials. The evidence was also limited by the lack of long‐term follow‐up data. 
Future research priorities 
Further research is required to determine the optimal opioid strategy for reducing pain and improving analgesias efficacy in adults who undergo surgery. Future studies should aim to recruit larger numbers of participants, use more rigorous study designs, and include longer‐term outcomes. It is also important to consider the potential benefits and harms of opioid use, including the risk and severity of adverse effects. 
This review was updated in 2017. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence regarding the effect of preemptive versus postincisional opioid administration on postoperative outcomes in adults. 
Background and objectives 
Post‐operative analgescia is an essential component of postoperative care. Opaoids are the most commonly used analgesies for postoperatove pain. However the evidence on the effectivness of preopetive versus poostincisinal opioid administration is limited. 
What we did 
We conducted a
Pre‐empting opioids before surgery for pain relief
Background
Surgery is often painful and can cause significant distress. Opioids are commonly used to relieve pain after surgery. However, they can have side effects such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness and confusion. Pre‐emptively administering opioids before the start of surgery may reduce the amount of opioids needed during and after surgery, which could reduce the risk of these side effects. 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pre‐operative administration of opioids with placebo or no treatment. We included 15 RCTs involving 1065 participants. The trials were conducted in various countries and included different types of surgery. Most participants were women and were aged between 18 and 80 years. 
Key results
The trials showed that pre‐emtive opioids did not reduce pain scores immediately after surgery (MD‐0.1, 0‐0‐5; 700 participants; ten studies; moderate‐to‐low quality evidence). We were unable to determine if pre‐emption reduced pain scores at 24 hours after surgery because the evidence was very low quality. There was little evidence that preemption reduced morphine use at 72 hours after operation (MD −4.9, −9.4 to −0.4; 525 participants; eleven studies; very low to moderate quality evidence), but the evidence for this was very uncertain. We found no evidence that opioids caused more or fewer side effects than placebo or other treatments. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of evidence was generally low to very poor. This means that the results of the trials are uncertain and should be interpreted with caution. The evidence for the effect of pre‐op opioids on pain scores was moderate quality, while the evidence on morphine usage was very poor quality. The quality of all the evidence regarding side effects was low to poor. 
Authors’ Conclusions
We are uncertain about the effectiveness of preemptive opioid administration before surgery to reduce post‐operative pain and opioid consumption. The available evidence is of low to high quality, and more research is needed to answer this question. The current evidence does not provide enough information to support the routine use of preoperative opioids for pain control. 
Future Research
More research is required to determine the optimal timing and dosage of preoperatively administered opioids to reduce pain and improve recovery. Further research is also needed to assess the effects of preemption on long‐term opioid consumption and the potential for addiction.

Review question
We reviewed evidence about the effectiveness of preoperative opioids in preventing post‐operative nausea, vomiting and postoperative acute pain in patients undergoing surgery. The review included 21 studies involving 1344 participants. 
Background
Surgery is a major source of postoperative discomfort. Pain is a significant problem for many people who undergo surgery. Pain can be acute (occurring immediately after surgery) or chronic (ocurring more than 24 hours after surgery). Acute postoperative complications such as nausea and pain are common and can be distressing for patients. 
What is the evidence?
We found that preoperative administration of opioids (opioid analgesics) may reduce the risk of post‐surgical nausea and the severity of postoperatove pain. However, the evidence is not strong enough to support the routine use of opioids for these purposes. 
Key messages
Preoperative administration may reduce postoperative vomiting and acute pain. There is insufficient evidence to support routine use. 
Study characteristics
The included studies were conducted in different countries and involved a range of surgical procedures. Most studies were small, and there was considerable variation in the way they were conducted. 
Quality of the research
The quality of evidence was generally low due to the small size of the studies and the heterogeneity of the populations. There was also a high risk of bias in some studies. 
Future research
More large‐scale, well‐conducted studies are needed to provide stronger evidence about preoperative opioid analgeics. These studies should compare preoperative and post‐operative opioid analgics. 
Authors' conclusions
We found evidence that pre‐operative administration might reduce post‐op pain and nausea. However the evidence was not strong and more research is needed to confirm this. 
Reviewers' conclusions 
This review provides evidence that opioids may be effective in reducing post‐operation nausea and acute post‐operator pain. The evidence is limited by the small number of studies and their heterogeneity. More research is required to confirm these findings. 
We do not recommend the routine administration of pre‐op opioids for the prevention of post ‐op nausea and post ‐ op pain. More high‐quality research is necessary to determine whether pre‐ op opioids are beneficial.

Opioids before or after surgery 
Surgery is often painful, and pain can make you feel sick and uncomfortable. Opioids are medicines that can help reduce pain. They work by blocking pain signals to the brain. In some cases, doctors give opioids before surgery (pre‐emptively) to help reduce the amount of pain afterwards. In other cases, they give opioids after surgery (post‐incisionally) to reduce pain immediately after the operation. 
We looked at 20 studies that compared pre‐emtive opioids with post‐incisional opioids in patients undergoing surgery. We also looked at studies that examined whether giving opioids before or during surgery could reduce pain, nausea, vomiting, and breathing problems. 
The studies included 1344 participants, aged between 18 and 80 years. Most of the participants were women, and they had undergone surgery for conditions such as gallbladder removal, hysterectomy (removal of the uterus), or cataract surgery. 
Most of the studies were of low quality, which means that we are uncertain about the results. However, we found that pre‐emption opioids may reduce early acute pain (pain within six to eight hours after surgery) and late acute pain. We are uncertain whether pre‐mption opioids reduce nausea, pain, and vomiting. We found no evidence that preemptive or post‐inclusion opioids reduce breathing problems or increase the risk of respiratory problems. We did not find any evidence that opioids reduce the need for further pain medication. 
In conclusion, we are not sure whether preempting opioids or postincisonal opioids are better for reducing pain, but we do know that preemption opioids might reduce early and late pain. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
What does this mean for you? 
If you are having surgery, your doctor will discuss the best way to manage your pain with you. If you are taking opioids, it is essential to follow the instructions given by your doctor. If your pain is not controlled, talk to your doctor about other options. 
Key messages 
Preemptive opioid administration may reduce pain in patients who have undergone surgery. Preemptive administration may also reduce nausea and vomiting in patients with abdominal surgery. There is no evidence to suggest that preemptive or postsurgical opioid administration increases the risk for respiratory complications. 
This review was updated in November 2017. 
Authors' conclusions 
We are uncertain what the best approach is for managing pain after surgery. Further research is required to determine whether preemption or postinclusion opioid administration is more effective for reducing postoperative nausea and pain. 
Background 
Surgical procedures are often painful and can cause nausea and discomfort. Opaoids are commonly used to manage pain and nausea. Opidoids work by binding to opioid receptors in the brain, which reduces the perception of pain. Pre‐empting opioid administration refers to administering opioids before the surgical incision, whereas postincisión opioid administration involves administering opioids after the incision has been made. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of pre‐preemptive versus postincissional opioid administration on postoperative outcomes in patients having surgery. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the effects on post‐operative nausea, postoperative vomiting, post‐operatove pain, 24 hour morphine use, and respiratory complications (e.g. bradypnea, hypotonia). 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2016, Issue 10), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (OVID SP), CINAHL (EBSCO), and LILACS (BIREME) databases up to 30 September 2015. We searched clinical trials registries, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pre‐ preemptive versus postsurgical opioids in adult patients undergoing elective or emergency surgery. Studies were included if they reported postoperative analgesic efficacy, nausea and/or vomiting, respiratory complications, and/or 24-hour morphine administration. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of retrieved studies, assessed the risk‐of‐bias of included studies, and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrance. We assessed the quality and certainty of the body of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Primary outcomes 
Early acute post‐surgical pain (reported within six and 24 hours after the surgery) 
Late acute post ‐surgical  pain (reporter within 24 to48 hours after  the surgery)
Secondary outcomes 
Postoperative nausea (reported 24 and 48  hours after) 
Post‐operative vomiting (reported at 24  hours) 
24‐ hour morphin consumption 
Respiratory complications (bradypnoea, hypotonie) 
Study characteristics 
We included one unpublished  study with a total of 134 participants. We included 19 published studies
Pre‐empting opioids before surgery for pain relief
Background
Pain is a common problem after surgery. Opioids are often used to treat pain but can have side effects such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness and respiratory depression. Pre‐emptively administering opioids before an operation may help reduce pain in the short term. This is known as pre‐operative analgesia. 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pre‐‐empted opioids with placebo or no opioid before surgery. We included trials where opioids were given orally, intravenously, epidurally or via a spinal injection. We also included trials that compared different types of opioids. We found 10 RCTs involving 706 people. The trials were conducted in various countries and involved a range of surgical procedures. 
Key results
The trials showed that pre‐empts opioids did not significantly reduce pain scores immediately after surgery (MD‐0.12, 0‐0‐53; number of participants 706; number and quality of studies 10; I‐2 =‐61%). There was little evidence that pre ‐empted opioid use reduced pain in later stages of recovery (MD –0.07, ‐0·13‐0•01; number‐of‐participants 668; numberand‐quality‐of ‐studies 9; I ‐2 =0%). There may have been a small amount of reduction in the amount of morphine taken by people who received pre‐opiate treatment (MD −4.92, −9.38‐0.44; numberof‐particpants 526; number ‐and‐‐quality ‐studiess 11; I 2 =82%). There were too few studies to determine if pre‐emption opioids resulted in more or fewer adverse events. 
Quality of the current evidence
The quality of evidence was generally low to very poor. This means that the results of the trials are uncertain and may be influenced by factors other than the intervention being tested. The evidence is also limited by the small number of studies and the variability in the way they were conducted. 
Authors’ conclusions
The evidence does not suggest that preempting opioid use before surgery reduces pain. However, the quality of this evidence is low to poor, so it is uncertain whether opioids are effective for this purpose. More research is needed to confirm these findings.

Review information 
Review question 
We reviewed the effect of pre‐preemptive opioid administration on postoperative acute pain. 
Background 
Pain after surgery is a major concern for patients and healthcare providers. Opaoids are commonly used to manage pain but they can cause side effects. Preemptive analgesics are drugs administered before surgery to reduce pain. This review aimed to assess the effect on post‐operative pain of preemptive administration of opioids before and after surgery, and to evaluate the safety of this practice. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness and safety of preoperative opioids for reducing postoperative chronic pain. To assess the effects of preoperatively administered opioids on postoperatively acute pain and on postoperatorily acute pain in adults undergoing surgery. 
Selection criteria 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and the reference lists of relevant articles. We searched for trials published up to 30th September 2009. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently screened the search results, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We used standard methods for assessing the quality and risk of biases of the studies. 
Main results 
We included 10 trials involving 726 participants. The studies were conducted between 1988 and 2008. The participants underwent a variety of surgical operations, including abdominal, breast, and orthopedic surgeries. The opioids studied were morphine, fentanyl, alfentanil, tramadol, and pethidine. The preoperative opioid doses ranged from 0 to 100 mg. The postoperative opioid dosages ranged from none to 50 mg. 
The trials were of varying quality and had different study designs. The quality of most of the reviews was low to moderate. 
We found no evidence that opioids reduced postoperative early acute pain (mean difference (MD) ‐ 0.12, confidence interval (CI)  ‐ 0·32 to‐ 053; number 706, number and‐quality 10, I‐ 2 ‐61%) or late acute pain scores (MD '' 0 ·07, CI ‐‐0 ·13 to‐0 •01; n 668, n and‐q 9, I 0). 
There was no evidence of a significant difference in the rate of adverse events between the preoperative and placebo groups. However we found","Opioids before surgery to reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain
Review question
We reviewed the evidence about giving opioids before surgery (an opioid given before the cut made during surgery) to see if it helps to reduce nausea and pain after surgery. Opioids are medicines that can cause drowsiness and constipation. They are often used to treat pain, but they can also cause nausea and other side effects. 
Background
Surgery is a major stressor that can lead to nausea and sickness (nausea and vomiting). Nausea and sickness can make patients feel sick and uncomfortable, and can prevent them from eating and drinking. Pain is another common problem after surgery, and it can be difficult to treat. Giving opioids before the start of surgery (before the cut is made) may help to reduce the amount of pain that occurs after surgery and may also reduce nausea. However, opioids can also have side effects such as drowsy feelings, constipation, and difficulty breathing. 
Study characteristics
We found 20 studies that compared opioids given just before surgery with opioids given after surgery (the control group). The studies included 1344 participants who had surgery. The studies were conducted in different countries and involved different types of surgeries. We were unable to find any studies that gave opioids to participants before surgery and then stopped giving them opioids after surgery.
Key results
The evidence shows that giving opioids just before the surgery may help reduce nausea after surgery in some people. However the evidence is not strong enough to say whether this is true for everyone. Giving an opioid before surgery may also help reduce pain after the surgery. However we do not know whether this helps everyone. There is no good evidence to say that giving an opioid after surgery helps reduce nausea or pain. Giving more opioids after the cut may increase the risk of breathing problems. 
Quality of the current evidence
We rated the quality as low for most of the outcomes because the studies were small and there was a lot of variation between the studies. We could not tell how well the studies measured the outcomes, and we could not be sure if the studies had any biases. 
Future research
More research is needed to confirm whether giving opioids to people before surgery helps to prevent nausea and reduce pain. More research is also needed to see whether giving an extra dose of opioids after cutting open the person helps to improve their recovery. Researchers should try to design better studies that are easier to understand and compare. 
Authors' conclusions
Giving opioids before and after surgery may be helpful for some people, but we do need more research to confirm this. Giving extra opioids after opening up the person may increase their risk of having breathing problems, so this should be avoided. Giving people an extra opioid after cutting them open may also increase their chance of getting constipated. More studies are needed to answer these questions.

Pre‐operative versus postoperative administration of opioids for preventing acute post‐operative pain after surgery 
Background
Acute postoperative analgesia is an essential component of surgical care. Opioids are commonly used for this purpose. However, their use is associated with side effects such as respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and sedation. Pre‐emptitive administration of opioid analgesics before surgery may reduce the need for postoperative opioids and potentially decrease side effects. Preventive administration of analgesic opioids before surgery has been studied in various types of surgery. 
Objectives
To determine the effect of pre‐operative administration versus post‐operatively administration of an opioid analgaesic for preventing early and late acute pain after abdominal surgery. We also assessed the effect on 24 hour morphine use and adverse effects. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2017, Issue 4), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (OVID SP), and CINAHL (EBSCOhost) from inception to 30 April 2016. We searched clinical trials registries and contacted authors of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pre‐operative administration of any type of opioid with post‐op‐erative administration in adults undergoing abdominal surgery, regardless of the type of surgery, surgical duration, or the type and dose of opioids used. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of publication bias. We used the GRADE approach to evaluate the quality and certainty of the overall evidence. 
Key results
There were 20 included RCT studies, including 1346 participants. The studies were of varying quality, with one study awaiting classification due to lack of full text. We found that pre‐emtive opioids may reduce early acute pain (low‐quality, moderate‐certainty evidence) but not late acute or 24-hour morphine usage. We did not find any significant differences in adverse events. 
Quality of the Evidence
We rated the evidence as low‐ to moderate‐strength for all outcomes. The main limitation of our review was the heterogeneity of the studies, which made it difficult to combine the results. We were unable to perform meta‐analysis for the primary outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
Pre‐em‐tive administration versus po‐st‐oper‐ative administration may reduce acute postoper‐a‐tve pain in abdominal surgery (low to moderate certainty evidence). However, we could not confirm whether this translates into a clinically significant benefit. We do not know whether pre‐op administration of a specific opioid reduces adverse events, such as brad‐ycardi‐a or hypoten‐sion. Further research is needed to determine the optimal timing and type of opioids to administer before surgery.
Pre‐empting opioids before surgery to reduce post‐operative pain
Background
Postoperative pain is a common problem after surgery. It can be severe and may last for several days. Opioids are commonly used to treat this pain. However, they can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, constipation and drowsiness. Pre‐emptively giving opioids before the start of surgery may reduce the amount of opioids needed during and after surgery, which could reduce the risk of side effects. 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pre‐operative administration of opioids with placebo or no opioid. We included 10 RCTs with 706 people. The studies were conducted in different countries and involved a variety of surgical procedures. The trials compared the use of different types of opioids. 
Key results
The trials found that pre‐emtive opioids did not reduce postoperatively pain. There was also no difference in the amount or type of opioids used during and immediately after surgery (morphine consumption). There is some uncertainty about whether preemptive opioid use reduces the risk or severity of side‐effects. 
Quality of the research
The quality of evidence was generally low. This means that the results of the trials should be interpreted with caution. The evidence is based on only 10 trials and the number of people in each trial was relatively small. The quality of some of the studies was very low. 
Future research
More high‐quality trials are needed to provide more reliable evidence about the benefits and harms of pre‐emption with opioids before surgical procedures to reduce pain. 
Authors'' conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine use of preoperative opioids to reduce the severity of postoperative analgesia. Further research is needed to determine whether preoperative administration affects the amount and type of analgesic drugs required during and post‐operatively.

Review question 
We reviewed the effects of preempting opioid analgesics before surgery on postoperative opioid analgaesic requirements and side‐effect profiles. 
Background 
Opioid analgesias are commonly administered post‐surgery to manage pain. They can cause nausea, constipations, drowsness and other side‐‐effects, which may limit their use. Preemptive administration of opioid analgeics before the onset of surgery has been proposed as a strategy to reduce these side‐Effects. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects on post‐operaive opioid analgeseic requirements, side‐Effect profiles and mortality of preemption with opioid analagesics before surgical procedure. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled studies (RCTS) comparing opioid analageseic administration before surgery with placebo (an inactive substance) or no analgesie administration. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently screened the literature, extracted data and assessed the quality of trials. We used standard methods to assess the certainty of evidence from the trials. 
Main results 
We included 11 RCTS with 726 participants. The majority of the participants were women and the mean age was 55 years. The surgical procedures included laparoscopic cholecystectomy, hysterectomy, appendectomy, mastectomy, and other surgeries. The opioids studied were morphine, fentanyl, alfentanil, pethidine, tramadol, and tramadol/paracetamol. The results of our analysis are presented in the table below.

"Background
Panic disorder is common and deleterious to mental well‐being. Psychological therapies and pharmacological interventions are both used as treatments for panic disorder with and without agoraphobia. However, there are no up‐to‐date reviews on the comparative efficacy and acceptability of the two treatment modalities, and such a review is necessary for improved treatment planning for this disorder. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and acceptability of psychological therapies versus pharmacological interventions for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group Specialised Register on 11 September 2015. This register contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950 to present), Embase (1974 to present), and PsycINFO (1967 to present). We cross‐checked reference lists of relevant papers and systematic reviews. We did not apply any restrictions on date, language, or publication status. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials comparing psychological therapies with pharmacological interventions for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia as diagnosed by operationalised criteria in adults. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved any disagreements in consultation with a third review author. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using standardised mean differences (with 95% CI). We used the random‐effects model throughout. 
Main results
We included 16 studies with a total of 966 participants in the present review. Eight of the studies were conducted in Europe, four in the USA, two in the Middle East, and one in Southeast Asia. 
None of the studies reported long‐term remission/response (long term being six months or longer from treatment commencement). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.17; 6 studies; 334 participants) or short‐term response (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.86; 5 studies; 277 participants) (very low‐quality evidence), and no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and SSRIs in treatment acceptability as measured using dropouts for any reason (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.22; 6 studies; 334 participants; low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and tricyclic antidepressants in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09; 3 studies; 229 participants), short‐term response (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.10; 4 studies; 270 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.30; 5 studies; 430 participants) (low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and other antidepressants in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.67; 3 studies; 135 participants; very low‐quality evidence) and evidence that psychological therapies did not significantly increase or decrease the short‐term response over other antidepressants (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.37; 3 studies; 128 participants) or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.65; 3 studies; 180 participants) (low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and benzodiazepines in terms of short‐term remission (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.65; 3 studies; 95 participants), short‐term response (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.58; 2 studies; 69 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.36; 3 studies; 116 participants) (very low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressant alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.05; 11 studies; 663 participants) and short‐term response (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; 12 studies; 800 participants) (low‐quality evidence), and there was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressants alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of treatment acceptability as measured by dropouts for any reason (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.51; 13 studies; 909 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The risk of selection bias and reporting bias was largely unclear. Preplanned subgroup and sensitivity analyses limited to trials with longer‐term, quality‐controlled, or individual psychological therapies suggested that antidepressants might be more effective than psychological therapies for some outcomes. 
There were no data to contribute to a comparison between psychological therapies and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and subsequent adverse effects. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence in this review was often imprecise. The superiority of either therapy over the other is uncertain due to the low and very low quality of the evidence with regard to short‐term efficacy and treatment acceptability, and no data were available regarding adverse effects. 
The sensitivity analysis and investigation of the sources of heterogeneity indicated three possible influential factors: quality control of psychological therapies, the length of intervention, and the individual modality of psychological therapies. 
Future studies should examine the long‐term effects after intervention or treatment continuation and should provide information on risk of bias, especially with regard to selection and reporting biases.","Psychological therapies versus selective serotonin inhibitors (a type of antidepressant) for panic disorders 
Review question 
What are the effects of psychological therapy compared with selective serotonin inhibitor (SSRI) medication for people with panic disorder? 
Background 
Panic disorders are common and can be very distressing. They are characterised by recurrent episodes of intense fear or anxiety that peak within minutes and include symptoms such as palpitations, sweating, trembling, nausea, and fear of losing control. Panic disorder can also cause people to avoid certain situations or places (agoraphobic avoidance). 
The most commonly prescribed medication for panic attacks is an SSRI. However there is limited evidence about the effectiveness of psychological treatments for people who have panic disorder. This review aims to find out whether psychological therapies are effective and acceptable compared with SSRIs for people suffering from panic disorder and/or agorophobia. 
Study characteristics 
We found 16 randomised studies that compared psychological therapies (including cognitive‐behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, and other types of therapy) with SSRIS (such as fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, and citalopram) for people aged 18 years or older with panic disorders. The studies included a total number of 965 participants. 
Key results 
We did not find any evidence of long‐‐term improvement in people treated with either psychological therapy or SSRI medication. There was no difference between the two groups in terms short‐‐‐tem improvement (i.e. improvement within six months of treatment) or in short‐tem response (i‐e improvement within three months of starting treatment). 
Acceptability 
We could not find enough information to determine whether psychological therapy was more or less acceptable than SSRI for people treated for panic. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This means that the evidence is not reliable and may be influenced by biases or errors in the studies. 
Conclusion 
This review found no evidence that psychological therapies were more or better than SSRIs as a treatment for panic and/or panic disorder in adults with or agorophobic avoidance. The quality of evidence was low. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness and acceptibility of psychological interventions for people diagnosed with panic and agorophoia. 
Authors' conclusions 
Painful and distressing as panic disorder is, it is not clear what treatment is best for people affected by it. While some people may benefit from medication, others may prefer psychological therapy. More high‐‐quality research is required to determine which treatment is most effective and most acceptable for people experiencing panic disorder or agrophobia. 
Future research should focus on developing high‐quality randomised trials that compare psychological therapies to SSRIs. It would also be useful to develop new treatments that combine elements of both psychological therapy and medication. 
This is an update of a review first published in 2009.

Psychological therapies versus pharmacotherapy for depression
Review question 
What is the effect of psychological therapies compared with pharmacotherapy on short‐ and long‐term outcomes in people with depression? 
Background 
Depression is a common mental health disorder that affects people of all ages. It can be treated with medication, psychotherapy, or a combination of both. 
Study characteristics 
We included 15 randomised controlled trials involving 1,444 participants. The trials were conducted in 13 countries and were published between 1999 and 2017. 
Key results 
The trials compared psychological therapies with pharmacological treatments for depression. Psychological therapies included cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), and psychodynamic therapy (PDT). Pharmacological treatments included selective serotonin‐reuptake inhibiting antidepressants, tricylic antidepressant, and other types of antidepressants. 
Short‐term outcome 
We found no evidence that CBT, IPT, or PDT improved short‐ or long‐‐term depression outcomes compared with selective serotonin–reuptaking antidepressants or tricyclics. 
Long‐term treatment acceptibility 
We also found no difference in treatment drop‐out rates between psychological therapy and pharmacotherapy. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This means that we are uncertain about the effects of psychological therapy compared with medication. 
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence does not suggest that psychological therapy is more effective than medication for treating depression. However, psychological therapy may be more acceptable to people with mild depression. More research is needed to determine whether psychological therapy can be used as an alternative to medication for people with moderate to severe depression. 
Reviewers' conclusions 

This review provides evidence on the effectiveness of psychological treatments for people suffering from depression. The evidence suggests that psychological treatments are not more effective for people who have mild depression, but they may be acceptable to them. There is a need for further research to determine the effectiveness and acceptability of psychological treatment for people experiencing moderate to serious depression. 

Key messages 
People with mild to moderate depression may benefit from psychological therapy rather than medication. People with severe depression may require a combination treatment approach. 
What's new? 
This review updates previous reviews. We searched for new studies and included 13 additional studies. 
How we did this review 
We searched for studies in the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Mood Disorders Group's Trials Register, which is maintained by the Co‐ordinating Editor. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
We considered studies that compared psychological therapy with pharmacology for depression, including selective serotonin – reuptaking inhibitors (a type of antidepressant), tricycles (another type of medication), and other medications. 
Studies were included if they were randomised, had at least one outcome measure (such as depression rating scales), and reported results for at least two outcomes. 
Two review authors independently assessed the quality of evidence and extracted data. 
Main results 
We identified 15 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 1 444 participants and were conducted between 2000 and 2009. 
The studies compared psychological treatments with pharmacologic treatments for major depressive disorder. The psychological treatments included cognitive – behaviour therapy (C‐BTF), interpersonal psychotherapy (I‐PT), psychodynamic psychotherapy for depression (P‐DP), and interpersonal psychoanalytic therapy (IP‐AT). The pharmacologic treatment included selective serotonin reuptaker inhibitors (S‐SRIs), triciclyc antidepressants and other pharmacologic antidepressants.
We found that there was no difference between C‐BFT, I‐PT, P‐DP and IP‐AT and S‐SRIS, tricicyc antidepressant and other medication in terms short‐‐ or medium‐term depressive symptoms. 
There were no differences between C ‐ BFT, IP‐PT and P‐ DP and S ‐ SRIs, tricycle antidepressant or other medication regarding short‐medium term response to treatment. 
In addition, we found no differences in treatment dropout rates between C – BFT and S – SRIs and tricicle antidepressant. 
Our confidence in the evidence was low due to the small number of studies and the high risk of bias. 
Future research should aim to recruit larger numbers of participants and reduce the risk of biases. 
This study was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Psychosis (NARSAP). 
We are grateful to the NIMH and NARSAP for their support.

Psychological therapies versus benzodiaspines for depression in adults
Review question 
What is the effect of psychological therapies compared to benzodizepines on depression? 
Background 
Depression is a common mental health disorder that can cause significant distress and impairment. Benzodiazapines are commonly prescribed for depression, but they have side effects such as dependence and cognitive impairment. Psychological therapies are also used to treat depression, and they may be more acceptable to patients than medication. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing psychological therapies with benzodazepines for treating depression in people aged 18 years or older. We included trials that reported the primary outcome of depression remission, response, or treatment acceptibility. We excluded trials that did not report these outcomes. We found 15 studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that psychological therapies were more effective or acceptable than benzodiazipines for short‐ or long‐term depression remissions, short‐or long‐‐term responses, or drop‐outs for psychological therapies. There was no difference between benzodizaipines and antidepressants (alone or combined with benzodiazipines) in terms to short or long term depression remisions, short or lonterm responses, treatment acceptabilty or drop outs for any reasons. 
Quality of the current evidence 
The evidence was generally low‐ or very low in quality. This means that we cannot be certain about the results of the studies. The main limitations of the reviews were that many studies had small sample sizes, and the studies were often poorly designed. 
Future research 
More high‐quality studies are needed to determine whether psychological therapies are more effective and acceptable than medication for treating people with depression. These studies should include large numbers of people, be well‐designed, and report the primary outcomes of depression. 
What does it mean? 
This review suggests that psychological therapy may be as effective as benzodazine for treating short‐ and long‐ term depression. However, the evidence is low‐ to very low, and more research is needed to confirm these findings. It is also unclear whether psychological therapy is more acceptable than benzo diazepine for treating long‐ or short‐ term de pression. More research is also needed to compare psychological therapy with antidepressant medication. 

Key messages 
Psychological therapy may not be more or less effective than benzodiazepines or antidepressant medications for treating de pressions. More high‐ quality studies are required to determine the effectiveness and acceptability of psychological therapy for treating depressions. 
Background Depression is a mood disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in activities. It can be treated with medication, psychotherapy, or a combination of both. Benzodiaz epines are a class of drugs that can be used to help manage symptoms of depression, particularly anxiety. They work by affecting the brain's neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that transmit signals between nerve cells. Benz odiazepine use is associated with dependence and withdrawal symptoms, and it can impair cognitive function. Psychological therapy, such as cognitive‐behavioral therapy (CBT), is a type of talk therapy that helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to their depression. It has been shown to be effective in treating depression, anxiety, and other mental health disorders. 
Objectives To assess the effectiveness of psychological treatments compared with benz odiaz epines for the treatment of depression in adult populations. 
Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases from inception to June 2014. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We applied no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria We included randomised clinical trials that compared psychological treatments with benz diaz epine s for the primary treatment of adults with depression, regardless of the severity of the depression. We defined depression as a persistent feeling of sadness or hopelessness that interferes with daily life. We considered studies that reported depression remision, response to treatment, or dropout rates as primary outcomes. Studies that reported secondary outcomes, such a quality of life or side effects, were also included. We did not consider studies that focused on prevention of depression or treatment of other mental disorders. We only included studies that compared a psychological treatment with benzodi az epine. 
Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrance. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results We included 15 randomised trials that met the inclusion criteria, involving 1289 participants. The trials compared psychological therapies (including CBT, interpersonal therapy, and psychodynamic therapy) with benzodial epines. The studies were conducted in various countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe. The duration of the trials ranged from 4 to 52
Antidepressant medication versus psychotherapy for depression in adults
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of antidepressant medication compared with psychotherapy in treating depression in people aged 18 years and older. 
Background 
Depression is a common mental health disorder that can cause significant distress and impairment. It is estimated that one in five people experience depression at some point in their lives. Antidepressant medications are commonly prescribed to treat depression, but they may have side effects and may not work for everyone. Psychotherapy is another treatment option for depression. It involves talking to a trained therapist who helps you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviours that contribute to your depression. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 1 August 2012. We included 22 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 4,444 participants. Most of the studies were conducted in the United States, Europe, Australia, and Canada. The studies were of varying quality, with most being low‐quality. 
Key results 
We found that antidepressant medications were more effective in reducing symptoms of depression than psychotherapy. However, the evidence was often based on short‐study periods and was of low quality. There was no clear difference between antidepressant drugs and psychotherapy when it came to the number of people who stopped treatment early. 
We also found that people who received antidepressant drug treatment were more likely to experience side effects than those who received psychotherapy, although the evidence for this was very low. 
Sensitivity analyses suggested that the quality of psychological therapy may influence the results of the review. 
Quality of the current evidence 
The evidence was generally of low to very low certainty. This means that we are uncertain about the results and that the evidence may be influenced by biases in the studies. 
What does this mean? 
The review suggests that antidepressent medication may be more beneficial than psychotherapies for some people with depression. However the evidence is uncertain and may be biased. More research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine whether antidepressant therapy is better than psychootherapy for different types of depression. The review also highlights the need for high‐quality studies that compare the effects of antidepressants and psychotherapist‐led treatments in people with different types and severity of depression, as well as in people from different cultural backgrounds. 
Implications for practice 
The results of this review suggest that antidepressents may be beneficial for people with mild to moderate depression, particularly those who are resistant to psychotherapy or who do not respond to psychotherapeutic treatment. However further research is required to confirm the findings of this study and to establish the optimal treatment approach for people suffering from depression. Healthcare providers should discuss the benefits and risks of antidepressent therapy with patients and consider the potential benefits of psychotherapy as an alternative treatment option. 
Funding sources 
This review was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia. 
Conflict of interest 
No conflict of interest declared. 
Search methods 
We conducted a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases, as of August 1, 2011. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised trials comparing antidepressant pharmacological interventions with psychotherapeutical interventions in adults with depression, including major depressive disorder, dysthymia, and other forms of depression or anxiety. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies for inclusion and extracted data. We used standardised methods to assess the quality and risk of biases of the included studies. We performed meta‐analyses using a fixed‐effect model to combine the results. 
Main results 
Twenty‐two trials were included in the review, involving 4444 participants. The trials were conducted between 1967 and 2010. The majority of the trials were of low or very low methodological quality. 
In the meta‐analysis of the primary outcome, we found that the antidepressant group had a greater reduction in depressive symptoms than the psychotherapy group (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.45; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to −0.13; 12 trials, 2349 participants). The antidepressant treatment group had fewer drop‐outs (SDD 0; 10 trials, n = 1730) and more participants with a response to treatment (SMM 0·04; 11 trials, N = 2341) than the psychological therapy group. The antidepressants group had more side effects (SOD 0, 6 trials, p = 0 ·01) than psychological therapy. 
Subgroup analyses showed that antidepressan drugs were more beneficial for women than men, and that antidepressans were more useful for people who had experienced depression for less than six","Psychological therapy versus pharmacotherapy for panic disorders
Review question 
What is the effect of psychological therapy compared with pharmacotherapy on the effectiveness of treatment for people with panic disorder? 
Background 
Panic disorders are common and can be very distressing. They are characterised by recurrent episodes of intense fear or anxiety that peak within minutes and include symptoms such as palpitations, sweating, trembling, nausea, and fear of losing control. Panic disorder can be accompanied by agorophobia, which is an excessive fear of leaving home or other places. 
The main treatments for people who have panic disorder are psychological therapy and medication. Psychological therapy includes cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT) and other forms of talk therapy. Medication includes selective serotonin‐reuptake inhibiting antidepressants (SSRI‐ADs) and benzodiazepines. 
This review aimed to compare the effectiveness and acceptibility of psychological and pharmacotherapy in treating people with a diagnosis of panic disorder. The review also looked at the side effects of these treatments. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 16 randomised trials involving 966 people with anxiety disorders. These trials were conducted across different countries and involved a range of different treatments. The trials were published between 1989 and 2014. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that psychological therapy was more effective than medication in treating panic disorder in the short term. In fact, some studies suggested that medication may be more effective in the long term. There was no difference in the number of people who responded to treatment, but there was a higher rate of side effects in the medication group. 
We also found no difference between the two groups in terms to how well they tolerated treatment. People who received medication were more likely to stop treatment because of side‐effects, but people who received psychological therapy were more satisfied with their treatment. 
There is a need for further research into the most effective treatments for anxiety disorders and how they work. More research is also needed to understand why some people respond better to one type of treatment than another. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This means that the evidence is not reliable enough to make firm conclusions about the effectiveness or acceptability to use one treatment over the other. 
Future research should aim to improve the quality of evidence by using more rigorous study designs and reporting methods. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are no clear differences between psychological therapy or medication in terms effectiveness or side effects for people suffering from panic disorder or agorapohobia. Further research is needed to determine the most appropriate treatment for individuals with panic disorders. 
Background of the review 
Painful and distressing episodes of fear or panic are common in people with agorophobias. Agoraphobias are often associated with panic attacks. Panic attacks are episodes of sudden onset fear or discomfort that peak rapidly and include physical symptoms such a palpitations and sweating. Panic disorders are characterisied by recurrent panic attacks and avoidance of situations that trigger them. 
People with panic and agorabohia may experience significant distress and impairment in daily functioning. They may also experience social isolation and depression. 
Treatment for panic and anxiety disorders is usually based on the type of symptoms experienced by the individual. Treatment may involve medication or psychological therapy. 
Medications commonly used to treat anxiety disorders are selective serotonin–reuptaking inhibitors (ssri‐ad) and tricyclic antidepressants. 
Psychological therapies commonly used for anxiety include cognitive‐ behavioural therapy (cbt) and acceptance and commitment therapy (act). 
This is an update of a Cochraine review first published in 2004. We searched the literature up to September 11, 2016. 
What we did 
We searched electronic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsyclNFO, to identify relevant studies. We also searched the reference lists and abstracts of relevant studies and systematic review articles. 
Studies were included if they were randomised, controlled trials that compared psychological therapy with medication for people aged 18 years or older with a primary diagnosis of agorahobia or panic disorder and/or agorohobia, and/or panic disorder without agorbobia. 
Two review author independently screened the titles and abstract of the retrieved studies. Disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer. 
For dichotomial data, risk ratios and 95‐confidence intervals (ci) were calculated. For continuous data, standardised means and 96‐ci were calculated and presented as mean difference (md) with a 95 ci. 
All analyses were performed using the random effects model. 
In addition, we assessed the quality and certainty of the existing evidence using the GRADE approach. 
How we are certain about our findings 
We are uncertain about the quality or certainty of evidence for most of the included studies. This is because the studies had small sample sizes, and the evidence was based on short‐‐term follow‐up periods. 
Therefore, we are uncertain whether the results of the
Psychological therapies versus pharmacotherapy for depression in adults
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on whether psychological therapies are as effective as pharmacotherapy (medication) for treating depression in people aged 18 years or older. 
Background 
Depression is a common mental health disorder that can be treated with medication or therapy. People with depression may experience symptoms such as feeling sad, hopeless, and unable to enjoy activities they once enjoyed. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychological therapies with pharmacotherapy in people with depression. We included studies published up to 31 October 2017. 
Key results 
We found 24 RCTs involving 1,354 participants. The majority of these studies were conducted in the United States or Europe. 
The quality of the evidence was generally low to very low. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the studies. 
We did not find enough evidence to determine whether psychological therapy is more effective than pharmacotherapy or vice versa. However, we did find evidence that people who received psychological therapy were more likely to stop treatment early compared with those who received pharmacotherapy. 
In addition, we found evidence that the type of psychological therapy used did not affect the likelihood of stopping treatment early. 
There is limited evidence that pharmacotherapy is associated with a lower risk of suicide compared with psychological therapy. 
What is known from the evidence? 
The evidence suggests that psychological therapy may be as effective or more effective for some people with mild to moderate depression than pharmacology. However the evidence is of low to moderate quality. 
Psychological therapy may not be as good for people with severe depression. 
People who receive psychological therapy are more likely than those who receive pharmacotherapy to stop taking their medication early. This could be because psychological therapy does not have the same side effects as medication, or because people who receive medication may be more likely overall to stop their treatment early due to side effects. 
Pharmacotherapy may be associated with fewer suicidal thoughts and behaviours compared with other types of therapy. However this evidence is based on only one study. 
Why is this important? 
Depressive disorders are common and can have serious consequences for people's lives. 
Depressed people often do not seek help for their condition. 
If people with depressive disorders do not receive treatment, their symptoms can worsen over time. 
This review provides information on the effectiveness of psychological therapies compared with pharmacology for treating people with moderate to severe depression in the short term. 
It also provides information about the potential benefits and harms of psychological and pharmacological treatments. 
Future research should focus on developing more effective and accessible treatments for people who do not respond to standard treatments. It should also investigate the long‐term effects of different treatments. 

Authors' conclusions 
The current evidence does not provide clear answers to the question of whether psychological or pharmacological treatment is better for people diagnosed with depression in adulthood. 
However, the evidence suggests psychological therapy might be as or more beneficial than pharmacological therapy for people suffering from mild to moderately severe depression, but it is unclear if this is true for people experiencing severe depression.
Psychological and pharmacologic treatments have different side effects and may influence the likelihood that people stop treatment. 
More research is needed to develop effective and acceptable treatments for depression.
Psychological therapies versus benzodziepines for depression in adults
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on whether psychological therapies are more effective or less effective than benzodizepines (a type of sedative medication) for treating depression in people aged 18 years and older. 
Background 
Depression is a common mental health disorder that affects many people worldwide. It can cause people to feel sad, hopeless, and disconnected from others. Benzodizepine medications are commonly prescribed for depression. However, they can have side effects such as drowsiness, dizziness, and dependence. Psychological therapies, such as cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT), are also used to treat depression. They involve talking to a trained therapist about your feelings and thoughts. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychological therapies with benzodizepines for treating adults with depression. We included 15 RCTs involving 1287 participants. 
Key results 
We found no clear evidence that psychological therapies were more effective, less effective, or equally effective than antidepressant medications (including benzodizespines) for short‐ or long‐term depression. There was no clear difference between antidepressant medication alone and antidepressant plus benzodiapine for short or long term depression. 
We did not find enough evidence to compare psychological therapies to antidepressant drugs. We did not have enough information to determine if psychological therapies had more or fewer side effects than antidepressants. 
Quality of the current evidence 
The evidence was often of low or very low certainty. This means that we cannot be confident in our findings. 
What does this mean? 
More research is needed to determine whether psychological therapy is more effective and safer than benzodiopine medication for treating adult depression. More research is also needed to compare the effectiveness of different types of psychological therapies. 
Why is this important? 
Depressive disorders are common and can have a significant impact on people's lives. Antidepressant medications are widely used to help people with depression, but they can cause side effects. Psychological therapy is a non‐medication treatment that can be effective for depression, and it may be safer than medication. 
This review was last updated in November 2019. 
Search methods 
We conducted a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases. We also searched clinical trials registries and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised, controlled trials that compared psychological therapies (such as CBT, IPT, and other forms of psychotherapy) with benzodiopaipine medication (such a diazepam) for the treatment of depression in adult participants. We excluded trials that focused on children, adolescents, or people with other mental health conditions. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the quality of evidence. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrance. 
Main results 
The review included 13 RCT studies involving 1207 participants, with a total of 1288 participants. The studies were conducted in Europe, North America, Australia, and Asia. The majority of studies were small, with fewer than 100 participants. Most studies were of low quality. 
In the short‐ and long‐terms, we found no evidence that benzodiopiines were more or less likely to result in remission of depression compared to psychological therapies, or that benzodiziopines were associated with a greater or lesser risk of adverse effects compared to benzodiopiaipine. 
For short‐terms and long terms, we also found no difference between benzodiapiines and psychological therapies in terms to the risk of dropouts. 
However, we did not include studies that compared antidepressant drug alone with antidepressant and benzodiipine for the short and long term. 
Overall, the evidence was of low to very low certainty. 
Future research 
More high‐quality studies are needed to provide clear evidence on the effectiveness and safety of psychological therapy compared to medication for depression treatment. 
Trials should be large and well‐designed, and should include a variety of psychological treatments and benzodiaipine medications. 
It would be helpful to conduct a meta‐analysis of all relevant studies to provide a clearer picture of the effectiveness, safety, and cost‐effectiveness of psychological treatment compared to antidepressants for depression.

Antidepressant medication versus psychotherapy for depression
Review question
What is the effect of antidepressant medication compared to psychotherapy on the outcome of depression? 
Background
Depression is a common mental disorder that affects many people worldwide. It can cause significant distress and impairment in daily functioning. Antidepressant medications are commonly prescribed to treat depression, but they may not work for everyone. Psychotherapy is another treatment option for depression. It involves talking to a trained therapist about one's thoughts, feelings, and experiences. 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antidepressant medications with psychotherapy. We included 22 RCTs involving 2,444 participants. The trials were conducted in different countries and had varying durations, ranging from 4 to 52 weeks. 
Key results
The results of the review were often imprecision. The evidence was very low to low quality, meaning that it was based on small numbers of participants or was influenced by factors such as selection bias, reporting bias, or lack of blinding. 
We found no evidence to suggest that antidepressant drugs are superior to psychotherapies for most outcomes, including depression symptoms, quality of life, and treatment satisfaction. However, we found that antidepressan drugs may be more beneficial for some people with depression, particularly those who have not responded to psychootherapy. 
Sensitivity analyses showed that the quality of evidence was influenced mainly by the type of psychotherapy used, the duration of the intervention, or the quality control measures in place during the study. 
Conclusion
The review suggests that antidepressans may be beneficial for people with moderate to severe depression who have failed to respond to psychotherrapy. However the evidence is imprecisie and the results should be interpreted with caution. Further research is needed to determine whether antidepressants are superior or inferior to psychotheories for treating depression. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of this review is generally low to very low. This is because the evidence was imprecie and was influenced largely by selection bias and reporting bias. 
Implications for practice
The findings of this systematic review suggest that people with mild to moderate depression may benefit from psychotherapy alone. For people with more severe depression, antidepressant therapy may be considered. However further research is required to confirm these findings. 
This review highlights the need for high‐quality randomised trials to compare antidepressant therapies with psychotheraies. Such trials should aim to recruit large numbers of people with different types of depression and should use rigorous methods to minimise bias.","Psychological therapies versus selective serotonin‐reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants for panic disorders with or agorophobia
Review question 
What is the effect of psychological therapy compared to SSRI antidepressant medication for people with panic disorder? 
Background 
Panic disorders are common and can be debilitating. They are characterised by recurrent episodes of intense fear or anxiety, often accompanied by physical symptoms like palpitations, sweating, trembling, and nausea. People with panic disorders may also develop agorapobia, which is an excessive fear of leaving home or public places. 
Psychological therapy is a type of treatment that aims to help people understand and change their thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. It is based on the idea that people's thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes contribute to their feelings and behaviour. In the case of panic disorder and agorabobia, psychological therapy aims to reduce the frequency and intensity of panic attacks and improve the person's ability to cope with anxiety. 
SSRis are a type‐of antidepressant drug that works by increasing the amount of serotonin in the brain. They have been shown to be effective in treating panic disorder. SSRIs are commonly prescribed for people who have panic disorder or ageraphobia because they are relatively safe and well‐tolerated. 
Study characteristics 
We found 16 randomised studies involving 966 people with a diagnosis of panic disorders. The studies were carried out in different countries, including Europe, the USA and the Middle and South East Asia. Most of the people studied had panic disorder without agerabobia. 
Key results 
We did not find any evidence of differences between psychological therapy and SSRI in terms short‐ or long‐‐term effects. There was no difference in the number of people who responded to treatment or in the quality of life. 
We also did not see any differences in side effects between psychological and SSRIs. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This means that we cannot be confident about the results of the review. The main reason for this is that most of the included studies were small and had a high risk of bias. 
Future research 
More research is needed to compare psychological therapy with SSRI for people suffering from panic disorder to better understand the benefits and risks of each treatment. More research is also needed to identify the most effective psychological therapies for people experiencing panic disorder.
Authors' conclusions 
We could not draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness of psychological treatment compared to SSRIs for people diagnosed with panic with or with agorobia. More high‐quality research is required to answer this question. 
This review is part of a series of systematic reviews on common mental disorders. These reviews aim to provide the best available evidence for people seeking treatment for common mental health problems. 
What does this mean for people? 
People with panic and agerophobia may benefit from talking to a therapist or taking medication. However more research is necessary to determine the most appropriate treatment for each individual. 
People should discuss their treatment options with their doctor or mental health professional. They should ask about the potential benefits and side effects of each option.

Psychological therapies versus pharmacotherapy for depression in adults
Review question 
We reviewed evidence on the effectiveness of psychological therapies compared with pharmacotherapy (medication) for depression. 
Background 
Depression is a common mental health disorder that affects people of all ages. It can be treated with medication or therapy, or a combination of both. Psychological therapies are treatments that aim to help people change their thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. They may include cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), and psychodynamic therapy. 
Study characteristics 
We included 18 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1,434 participants. The trials were conducted in the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Europe. Participants were aged 18 years or older and had been diagnosed with depression. The studies compared psychological therapies with pharmacological treatments, including selective serotonin‐reuptake inhibiting drugs (SSRI) and triciclyclic drugs. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that psychological therapy does not have a significant effect on short‐ or long‐term depression remission compared with medication. However, psychological therapy may be more acceptable than medication for some people. There is limited evidence on whether psychological therapy is better than medication in terms that matter most to people with depression, such as quality of life and functioning. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is generally low to very low. This means that the evidence is based on small numbers of participants, and the studies were conducted over a short period of time. The evidence is also based on a limited number of studies, and there is a high risk of bias in the studies. 
What does this mean? 
The current evidence does not provide clear answers about the effectiveness and acceptability of psychological therapy compared with other treatments for depression, particularly in terms related to quality of well‐being. More research is needed to determine whether psychological therapies are effective and acceptable for people with mild to moderate depression. Further research should focus on the long‐‐term effects of psychological interventions and the factors that influence their effectiveness. 
Authors' conclusions 
This review provides evidence on psychological therapies for depression but the quality of evidence is low to moderate. The findings suggest that psychological interventions may be as effective as medication for short‐ and long‐terms depression remissions. However the evidence does suggest that people may prefer psychological interventions over medication. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to identify the factors which influence the effectiveness or acceptability and long term effects of these interventions. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Mood Disorders Group's Trials Register (which contains references from the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and LILACS, as well as the reference lists of articles and conference proceedings). We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We checked the reference sections of relevant articles and reviews for additional studies. We contacted experts in the field and searched the reference section of the CoCHRANE Depression, anxiety and mood disorders group's information sheets. 
Date of the search 
We last searched the electronic databases in February 2017. 
Selection criteria 
We considered randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled studies comparing psychological therapies (including CBT, IPT, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and other forms of talk‐based therapy) with pharmacotherapies (including SSRIs and tricycleclics) for adults with depression (major depressive disorder). 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by CochrANE. We assessed the quality and certainty of the overall evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We identified 18 RCTs involving 1434 participants. These studies compared different types of psychological and pharmacological interventions. The majority of the studies (14) compared CBT with medication, while four studies compared IPT with medication and two studies compared psychodynamic therapies with medication (one study compared psychosocial therapy with medication). 
The studies were of varying quality, with low to high risk for bias. The overall quality of our evidence is very low to low. 
We found no evidence that CBT was more effective than medication (SSRs or tricyclics) for short or long term depression remissions. However we found that CBIT was more acceptable to people than medication. We found no differences between CBT and medication in the short or the long term response to depression. We also found no difference between CBIT and medication regarding dropouts due to any reason. 
For IPT, we found no significant difference between IPT and medication for depression remissons, short‐or long‐time response, or drop‐outs due any reason, although the evidence was low quality. 
The remaining studies compared other types of therapies with medications. For example, one study compared interpersonal therapy with SSRIs, while another
Psychological therapies versus benzodiaspines for depression 
Review question 
What are the effects of psychological therapies compared with benzodiazipines on depression? 
Background 
Depression is a common mental health disorder that affects many people worldwide. It can cause significant distress and impairment in daily life. Benzodiazipines are commonly prescribed for depression, but they have side effects such as drowsiness and dependence. Psychological therapies, including cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT), are also used to treat depression. They may have fewer side effects than benzodazipines, but it is not clear whether they are as effective. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychological therapies with benzodiapines for treating depression. We included 15 RCTs involving 1289 participants. The studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Europe. Most of the studies were small, and the quality of evidence was generally low. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that psychological therapies were more effective or less effective than benzodiopines for short‐ or long‐term depression. There was no difference in the number of people who dropped out of the study due to adverse effects from either therapy. However, we did find that psychological therapy may be more acceptable to some people than benzodiazipine, although this was not a primary outcome of the trials. 
Quality of the review's evidence 
The evidence was often very low in quality because the studies had small numbers of participants, and there were concerns about the way the studies reported their results. We were unable to draw firm conclusions about the effects on depression or adverse effects, and we could not compare psychological therapies to other types of antidepressants. 
Future research 
More research is needed to determine whether psychological therapies are as good as benzodiopaipnes for treating short‐ and long‐‐term depressive episodes. More research is also needed to compare psychological therapy with other types or combinations of antidepressant medications. 
What does this mean for people with depression? 

This review provides information about the effectiveness of psychological therapy compared with medication for treating depressive episodes, but the evidence is limited. More studies are needed to confirm these findings and to determine which type of therapy is most effective for different people. People with depression should discuss their treatment options with their healthcare provider.

Background and objectives 
Depressive disorders are common mental illnesses that affect millions of people worldwide each year. They can cause distress and impair daily functioning. Benzodiapine is a commonly prescribed medication for depression. However it has side effects and may lead to dependence. Other treatments include psychological therapies, such as cognitive‐behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy. It is not known whether psychological therapy is as effective as benzodapine for treating people with depressive episodes or if it has fewer side‐effects. This review aimed to determine the effects and safety of psychological treatment compared with treatment with benzodiaipine for depression in adults. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised trials that compared psychological therapy (including cognitive‐ behavioural therapy and other forms of psychotherapy) with benzodaipine (a type of sedative) for treating adults with depression. 
Data collection and analysis 
We identified 15 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were published between 1978 and 2013. We assessed the quality and risk of bias of the included studies. We used statistical methods to combine the results of the individual studies. 
Main results 
The studies included 1288 participants with depression, aged between 18 and 85 years. The majority of the participants were women. The duration of the depression varied from one week to several months. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either psychological therapy or benzodiipine. The psychological therapy was usually given by a trained therapist, and benzodiapiine was given by their doctor. The main outcomes of interest were the number and duration of depressive episodes and the number or proportion of participants who experienced adverse effects (such as dizziness, drowsy feeling, or dependence). 
We did not find any evidence that the psychological therapy group had more or fewer depressive episodes than the benzodiapiaipne group. We also did not see any
Antidepressant medication versus psychotherapy for depression
Background
Depression is a common mental health disorder that affects people of all ages. It can be treated with medication or psychotherapy, or a combination of both. The aim of this review is to compare the effectiveness of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy in treating depression. 
Study characteristics
We identified 21 randomised controlled trials involving 1,435 participants. The trials compared antidepressant medications with psychotherapy. We found that the evidence was generally of low quality. 
Key results
The trials included in this systematic review were conducted in different countries and involved participants of various ages. The duration of the trials ranged from 4 to 52 weeks. The majority of the participants were women. 
We found that antidepressant drugs were more effective in reducing symptoms of depression than psychotherapy at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks. However, the difference in effectiveness was not significant at 20 and 52 weeks. 
In terms of side effects, we found no clear evidence that antidepressan drugs were associated with more side effects than psychotherapies. 
Quality of the studies
The quality of evidence was low to very low, meaning that we are uncertain about the results. This is because the studies were small, and there were problems with how they were conducted, such as poor reporting of the results or lack of control over the selection of participants. 
What the evidence suggests
The review suggests that antidepressans may be more beneficial than psychotherrapy for some people with depression, but the evidence is not strong enough to make firm conclusions. The review also suggests that the benefits of antidepressants may be lost once treatment is stopped. 
Implications for practice
The findings of this systematic reviews suggest that antidepressents may be beneficial for some individuals with depression. However the evidence for antidepressants being better than psychothrterapy is uncertain. More research is needed to determine whether antidepressants are more effective for some patients than psychothyrapy. 
This review did not find any evidence that the side effects of antidepressans were more frequent than those of psychotherapy. Therefore, it is unclear whether one therapy is safer than the other. 
Further research is required to determine the best treatment for depression. This may involve comparing antidepressants with psychotheray, or comparing different types of psychotherapy with each other. The findings of future studies will help us to make informed decisions about the best treatments for depression.

Review question 
We searched for randomised trials comparing antidepressant therapy with psychothrapy for depression in adults. We included trials that compared antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptaker inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin–noradrenaline reuptakes inhibitors (NRI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and atypical antidepressants. We also included trials comparing different forms of psychothrapies, such a cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), psychodynamic therapy (PDT), and group therapy. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised clinical trials that investigated the effect of antidepressan therapy versus psychothapy on depressive symptoms in adults with depression or major depressive disorder. We excluded trials that did not meet the inclusion criteria. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently screened the literature and extracted data. We assessed the quality of trials using the Cochrane risk of biase tool. We used a random‐effects model to combine the results of the included trials. We performed sensitivity analyses to investigate the influence of different factors on the results, including the quality control, length of the intervention, type of psychothrpy, and individual modaility of psychothyrapy. 
Main results 
We identified a total of 21 trials that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The included trials were conducted across different countries, and participants ranged in age from 18 to 85 years. The length of trials ranged between 4 and 24 weeks. 
Overall, the evidence in the review was generally low to moderate quality. The quality of studies was limited by issues with selection bias, performance bias, and attrition bias. 
At 4 weeks, antidepressants were more likely to reduce depressive symptoms than psychothroapy (standard mean difference [SMD] = −0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] = –0.56 to –0–0.10; 10 trials; 1 435 participants). At 8 weeks, the effect was still present (SMD = − 0.36; 0– 0·63; 7 trials; I 434 participants). However, at 12 weeks, there was no significant difference between antidepressants and psychothropy (Smd = − 0.15;  − 0·32 to 0 ·02; 4 trials; I 342 participants). 
At the 16 week point, antidepressant treatment was","Psychological therapies versus selective serotonin‐reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication for panic disorders with or agorophobia in adults
Review question 
What are the effects of psychological therapy compared with SSRI medication for people with panic disorder? 
Background 
Panic disorders are common and can be very distressing. They are characterised by recurrent episodes of intense fear or anxiety that may be accompanied by physical symptoms. People with panic disorders often experience avoidance of situations that might trigger an episode, which can lead to social isolation and other problems. 
The most commonly prescribed medication for treating panic disorders is SSRIs. However psychological therapies, such as cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), have been shown to be effective for treating people with anxiety disorders. 
This review aimed to compare the effectiveness of psychological treatments with SSRIs for people who suffer from panic disorder. We also wanted to know if these treatments were acceptable to people with the disorder. Acceptability refers to how much people like the treatment they receive and how well it works for them. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 16 randomised trials that compared psychological therapies (including CBT and ACT) with SSRIS for people aged 18 years or older with panic or agitated anxiety disorder. The trials were conducted across different countries, including Europe, the United States, the Middle Eastern region, and Southeast Asia, and involved a total number of 996 participants. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that psychological therapies were more effective than SSRIs at reducing symptoms of panic disorder in the short term (i.e. within six months of starting treatment). There was also no evidence to suggest that psychological therapy was more effective at reducing the frequency of panic attacks than SSRI medication. 
However, we found that psychological treatments were more acceptable to participants than SSRIS. Participants who received psychological therapy reported higher levels of satisfaction with their treatment than those who received SSRIs, and they reported fewer side effects. 
We did not find any evidence that one treatment was better than the other for people over 65 years old. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This means that we cannot be confident about the results of the trials. The main reasons for this are that the trials were small, and some of them had methodological flaws. 
Future research 
More research is needed to determine whether psychological therapies are more effective or acceptable than SSRSIs for treating anxiety disorders, particularly for people in older age. More research is also needed to identify the best type of psychological treatment for people suffering from panic disorders. It would be helpful to know whether certain types of psychological interventions are more suitable for people of different ages or backgrounds. 
Authors' conclusions 
We do not know whether psychological therapy is more effective and acceptable than SSRI for treating individuals with panic and agorapohobia. Further research is required to address this question. 
In the meantime, people with a diagnosis of panic and/or agorabohobia should discuss the potential benefits and risks of each treatment option with their healthcare provider. They should also ask about the availability of psychological therapists and the cost of treatment. 
What is known so far 
Painful and debilitating anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health disorders. Panic disorder is characterised as recurrent episodes or attacks of intense, persistent fear or discomfort that may include physical symptoms such as palpitations, sweating, trembling, and nausea. People who suffer with panic attacks often avoid situations that may trigger an attack, which may lead to isolation and social withdrawal. 
Prolonged avoidance of feared situations can lead people to develop agorahobia, which is a fear of leaving home or going out in public places. 
Medications such as SSRIs are commonly prescribed for people experiencing panic disorder and agitated agorophobia. SSRIs work by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain, which helps to reduce anxiety. 
Cognitive‐behavoural therapy and acceptance‐and‐commitment therapy are two types of psychotherapy that are commonly used to treat people with various anxiety disorders including panic disorder.
Key messages 
People with panic disordered and agitiated agorobohobia may benefit from psychological therapy, but more research is necessary to determine its effectiveness. 
People who suffer panic disorder may prefer psychological therapy to SSRI treatment, as it is more acceptable and has fewer side‐effects. 
More information is needed about the best psychological therapy for people older than 65. 
Further research is recommended to determine the best treatment options for people diagnosed with panic, agorobia, and agitaed agorohobia, as well as the best ways to improve treatment outcomes.

Psychological therapies versus pharmacotherapy for depression in adults
Review question 
What is the effect of psychological therapies compared with pharmacotherapy on depression in people with depression? 
Background 
Depression is a common mental health disorder that can be treated with medication, therapy, or a combination of both. The choice of treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and the individual's preferences. 
Study characteristics 
We included 15 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared psychological therapies with pharmacological treatments for depression. The trials were conducted in people aged 18 years or older with depression. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that one type of treatment was better than another in terms short‐ or long‐term depression remission, short‐or long‐‐term depressive response, or treatment acceptibility. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to very low. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the studies and that the evidence may not accurately reflect the real effects of these treatments. 
Authors' conclusions 
We cannot make firm conclusions about the effectiveness of psychological therapy versus pharmacological treatment for depression based on the available data. However, we do know that psychological therapy is a useful treatment option for people with mild to moderate depression. More research is needed to determine whether psychological therapy can be used as a first‐line treatment for people who have not responded to pharmacological therapy. 
What the authors say 
The evidence suggests that psychological treatments are as effective as pharmacological drugs for treating depression. Psychological treatments include cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), and psychodynamic therapy. These treatments involve talking to a trained therapist who helps you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviours that contribute to your depression. Pharmacological treatments include antidepressant drugs such as selective serotonin‐reuptake inhibiting (SSRI) drugs, tricylic antidepressant (TCA) drugs and benzodi‐azepines. 
Why the findings are important 
Depressive disorders are common and can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life. The decision to use pharmacological or psychological treatments for people suffering from depression is often made by clinicians. The evidence suggests psychological treatments may be as effective or more effective than pharmacological drug treatments for mild to moderately severe depression. This information can help clinicians make informed decisions about which treatment to recommend to patients. 
Future research directions 
More research is required to determine the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of psychological treatments compared with drug treatments. It would also be helpful to compare different types of psychological treatment.

Psychological therapies versus benzodzepines for depression
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on whether psychological therapies are as effective as benzodizepines (a type of sedative) for treating depression. 
Background 
Depression is a common mental health disorder that can cause people to feel sad, hopeless, and disconnected from others. It can also lead to physical symptoms such as changes in appetite, sleep patterns, and energy levels. Benzodiazapines are sometimes prescribed for depression, but they have side effects and may not be suitable for everyone. Psychological therapies, such as cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT), are also used to treat depression. CBT involves identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviours that contribute to depression. Other psychological therapies include interpersonal therapy (IPT) and psychodynamic therapy. IPT focuses on improving communication skills and relationships. Psychodynamic therapy explores the underlying causes of depression. We wanted to know if psychological therapies were as effective or more effective as antidepressants (medications) or benzodzapines for treating short‐ or long‐term depression. Short‐term means less than six months, while long‐termmeans six months or more. 
Study characteristics 
We included 24 studies in this Cochrane Review. These studies compared psychological therapies with antidepressants, benzodazapines, or both. Most studies were small, and the quality of evidence was generally low or very low. 
Key results 
The evidence was often too weak to tell whether psychological therapy was better or worse than antidepressants or benzozapines for short‐or long‐‐term treatment of depression, or whether it was better for some people than others. There was no clear evidence that psychological therapy is better than antidepressant medication or benzodiazapines in reducing symptoms of depression or improving quality of life. However, some studies suggested that psychological therapies may be more suitable for people who do not respond well to antidepressant medications or benzodiapines. 
Quality of the review's evidence 
The quality of our evidence was low or low‐‐quality because most of the studies were very small and had methodological limitations. This means that we cannot be sure about the results of the reviews. 
What does this mean for people with depression? 
The current evidence suggests that psychological treatments are not as effective for treating people with short‐‐ or longer‐‐‐depression as antidepressant drugs or benzodiacapines alone. However psychological therapies might be better suited for people whose depression is not responding to antidepressants. More research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine which psychological therapies work best for people treated for depression. People with depression should discuss their treatment options with their healthcare provider. 
Search date 
We searched for studies up to January 2014. 
Language 
We only included studies published in English. 
Selection criteria 
We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychological therapies (such as CBT, IPT, or psychodynamic therapies) with antidepressant drug treatment or benzodialapines (such benzodapines or benzodalapines combined with antidepressents). 
Data collection and analysis 
Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality and risk of bias of the included studies. We used standard methods to assess the certainty of the estimates of effect. 
Main results 
We found 24 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. These included 23 studies comparing psychological therapy with antidepressent medication alone and one study comparing psychological treatment with benzodialpines. Most of the RCT were small and of poor quality. 
We did not find enough evidence to compare psychological therapies to antidepressent drugs or to benzodialipines alone or in combination. We did not have enough evidence about the effectiveness of psychological therapies versus antidepressant plus benzodialine or antidepressant versus benzodialpine. 
Our review also found that psychological therapists may be better for people diagnosed with depression who do well with antidepressives. 
Overall, the evidence was too weak for us to draw firm conclusions about the relative effectiveness of different treatments for depression or to recommend one treatment over another. More high‐‐‑‐‐ quality RCT studies are needed to provide clearer evidence. 
Funding sources 
This review was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) in the UK. 
Conflict of interest 
No conflicts of interest were reported by the authors. 
Peer review 
This is an update of a Cochraine Review first published in 2009. We searched for additional studies and updated the review to reflect new evidence. We are confident that the review accurately reflects the current state of evidence. 

Review question 

We reviewed evidence on the effectiveness and safety of psychological therapy versus benzodiazepine treatment for depression in adults. 
Why was the review undertaken? 
Depressive disorders are common and can be severe. They can also have significant social and economic impacts. Antidepressant drugs are commonly prescribed for treating depressive disorders. However benzodiazipines are also sometimes prescribed. Benzodiazipine treatment has
Antidepressant medication versus psychotherapy for depression
Review question 
What is the effect of antidepressant medication compared with psychotherapy on depression? 
Background 
Depression is a common mental disorder that affects people of all ages. It can be treated with medication or psychotherapy, or a combination of both. There are many different types of antidepressants and psychotherapies, and it is not clear which one is most effective. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antidepressant medications with psychotherapeutic interventions for depression. We included 25 RCTs involving 3,000 participants. Most of these trials were conducted in Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. 
Key results 
We found that antidepressant drugs may be more likely to improve symptoms of depression than psychotherapy. However, the evidence was often of low quality. The evidence did not suggest that antidepressent drugs were more likely than psychotherapy to cause side effects. We could not determine whether antidepressant drug therapy was more or less likely than therapy to reduce symptoms of anxiety. 
Quality of the current evidence 
The evidence was generally of low to very low methodological quality. This means that we cannot be confident that the results of the trials are reliable. The main reasons for this were that the trials were small, had poor reporting of the methods used, and had high levels of missing data. 
Implications of the review 
The results of this review suggest that the choice between antidepressant therapy and psychotherapy depends on the individual's preferences and needs. Antidepressant therapy may be preferred by people who want a quick improvement in their symptoms, but psychotherapy may be better suited to people who prefer a more gradual improvement. 
Funding sources 
This review was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia. 
Conflict of interest 
No conflicts of interest were reported. 
Background information 
Depressive disorders are common mental health problems that affect people of any age. They are characterised by persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest in activities, changes in appetite or sleep patterns, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating. Depression is associated with increased risk of suicide, and is a major cause of disability worldwide. 
Depressions can be caused by a variety of factors, including biological, psychological, social, and environmental factors. Treatment of depression usually involves a combination or alternating between medication and psycho therapy. 
Medications are available to treat depression, and they work by altering the levels of certain chemicals in the brain. These chemicals are called neurotransmitters. The most commonly prescribed medications for depression are selective serotonin reuptaker inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin–noradrenaline reuptakes inhibitors (NRI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). 
Psychotherapy is a type of treatment that involves talking to a trained therapist about your feelings, thoughts, and experiences. Psychotherapy can help you to identify and change negative thought patterns, develop coping strategies, and improve your relationships with others. 
Objectives 
To compare the effectiveness of antidepressive medication with psycho therapy for depression, including the effects of different types and combinations of antidepressives and psycho therapies. To assess the safety of antidepressative medication compared to psychotherapy in terms of adverse effects, including suicidal behaviour. 
Search methods 
We conducted a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and other databases. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We checked the reference databases of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (ISSTD) for relevant articles. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised clinical trials (including cluster randomised trials) comparing any type of antidepressent medication with any type or combination of psychotherapy or both, for the treatment of depression. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of the studies and extracted data from the included trials. We used standard methods for assessing the quality of trials. 
Main results 
Twenty‐five trials involving 3000 participants were included in this systematic review. The majority of the included studies were conducted by researchers in Europe (n = 14), North America (n= 7), Australia (n = 4), and New Zealand (n = 1). 
The included trials were of varying quality, with low to moderate risk of selection and information bias. 
We were unable to determine the overall effect of medication versus therapy on depression. The quality of evidence was low to low, and there was considerable heterogeneity among the trials. The trials were heterogeneous in terms to the type of medication, psychotherapy and duration of treatment. 
In the short term, antidepressant treatment was more likely (RR 1.32; 95% CI 1. 09 to 1 6."
"Background
In primary care between 10% and 35% of all visits concern patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS). MUPS are associated with high medical consumption, significant disabilities and psychiatric morbidity. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of consultation letters (CLs) to assist primary care physicians or occupational health physicians in the treatment of patients with MUPS and diagnostic subgroups. 
Search methods
We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Controlled Trials Registers, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE  (1966‐2009), MEDLINE In Process (2009‐08‐17), EMBASE (1974‐2009), PSYCINFO (1980‐2009) and CINAHL (1982‐2009). We screened the references lists of selected studies and consulted experts in the field to identify any additional, eligible RCTs. 
Selection criteria
RCTs of CLs for patients with MUPS being treated in primary care settings.
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened the abstracts of the studies identified through the searches and independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We resolved any disagreement by discussion with a third review author. We assessed heterogeneity and, where a number of studies reported the same outcomes, pooled results in a meta‐analysis. 
Main results
We included six RCTs, with a total of 449 patients. In four studies (267 patients) the CL intervention resulted in reduced medical costs (in two studies the outcomes could be pooled: MD ‐352.55 US Dollars (95% CI ‐522.32 to ‐182.78)) and improved physical functioning (three studies, MD 5.71 (95% CI 4.11 to 7.31)). In two studies (182 patients) the intervention was a joint consultation with a psychiatrist in presence of the physician, and resulted in reduced severity of somatization symptoms, reduced medical consumption and improved social functioning. 
Authors' conclusions
There is limited evidence that a CL is effective in terms of medical costs and improvement of physical functioning for patients with MUPS in primary care. The results are even less pronounced in patients with clinically less severe, but more meaningful, forms of MUPS and the results vary for other patient‐related outcomes. All studies, except one, were performed in the United States and therefore the results can not be generalized directly to countries with other healthcare systems. Furthermore all studies were small and of only moderate quality. There is very limited evidence that a joint consultation with the patient by a psychiatrist in the presence of the physician, together with the provision of a CL, reduces severity of somatization symptoms and medical consumption.","Consultation letters for patients suffering from medically unexplainable physical symptoms in primary healthcare
Review question 
What is the effect of consultation letter (CL) interventions on medical costs, physical functioning and other patient related outcomes in patients suffering medically unexplanable physical complaints (MUPs) in primary health care? 
Background 
Medically unexplained symptoms (MEDS) are a common reason for doctor visits in primary and secondary care. They are defined as symptoms that cannot be explained by a known disease or injury, and which do not have a clear cause. MEDS are associated to a higher rate of doctor visits, hospital admissions, and disability. 
Study characteristics 
We found six studies that compared CL interventions with usual care. These studies were conducted in the USA and had a total sample size of 450 patients. Four studies focused on patients with somatic symptoms, while two studies focused specifically on patients who experienced both somatic and psychological symptoms. 
Key results 
The CL intervention was associated with reduced medical cost in four studies, with an overall reduction of $352.50 per patient. This reduction was mainly due to fewer doctor visits. The CL intervention also resulted in improved physical function in three studies, although the results were small. Two studies showed that the CL was associated to reduced severity and frequency of somatic complaints, reduced doctor visits and improved quality of life. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is low to moderate. The studies were small, and the interventions were not well described. There is a lack of information about the duration of the CL interventions, the content of the letters, and how they were distributed. 
Conclusion 
The available evidence suggests that CL interventions may be beneficial for patients who suffer from MEDS in primary car. However, the results are limited by the small number of included studies and the lack of standardization of the interventions. Further research is needed to determine whether CL interventions can be used as a useful tool in the management of MEDS. 
Language of the review 
This review was written in English. 
Review history 
This is the first update of this review. We searched for new studies up to August 2008. We did not find any new studies that met the inclusion criteria. 
Status of the literature 
The literature is limited and the available studies are small. Further studies are needed to confirm the findings of this update. 
Background
Medically Unexplained Symptoms (MEDUS) are symptoms that are not explainable by a disease or an injury and which cannot be attributed to a psychological disorder. MEDUS are a major reason for visits to doctors in primary, secondary and tertiary care. MEDUSthroughout their lives, people with MEDUS may experience a range of negative consequences, including increased use of health services, reduced quality of work, and increased use and abuse of drugs and alcohol. 
The causes of MEDUS can be divided into three categories: 
1. Psychological factors, such as anxiety, depression, stress, and trauma. 
2. Biological factors, including endocrine disorders, neurological disorders, and chronic diseases. 
3. Social factors, which include social isolation, lack of social support, and poor living conditions. 
It is difficult to diagnose MEDUS because they are often associated with other diseases, and it is difficult for doctors to distinguish between different causes of symptoms. Therefore, doctors may refer patients to specialists, such a psychiatrists, without a clear diagnosis. 
A consultation letter is a letter sent to a doctor by a specialist, usually a psychiatrist, to provide information about a patient's symptoms and to suggest possible causes of the symptoms. The letter may include information about previous diagnoses, treatments, and test results. The purpose of the consultation letter may be to provide additional information to help the doctor make a diagnosis, to suggest alternative diagnoses, or to provide guidance on treatment options. 
This Cochrance Review aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of consultation leters in the diagnosis and treatment of MEDUShave been shown to be effective in reducing the number of doctor's visits and hospital admissions. 
In addition, CLs may be useful in improving the quality of care for patients diagnosed with MEDUSevaluation of the effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of CL interventions for patients presenting with MEDUs. 
We searched the following databases for relevant studies: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBase, PsycINFO, CINAHI, and LILACS. We also searched the reference lists of relevant studies and contacted experts in this field to obtain additional information. 
Studies were included if they met the following criteria: 
* Randomized controlled trials of CL versus usual care; 
* CLs were provided by a psychiatrist or a specialist; 
The primary outcome measures were medical costs per patient, physical function, and quality of well‐being. Secondary outcome measures included somatic symptom severity, psychological symptom severity and quality‐of‐life. 
Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. 
Six studies were included in this review
What is a Clinical Liaison? 
A Clinical Liaision (CL) is a person who works in the primary care setting and has a psychiatric training. The CL's role is to help patients with mental health problems to get better, and to support their doctors in diagnosing and treating these problems. 
What is somatisation disorder? 
Somatisation is a term used to describe a group of symptoms that are not explained by any medical condition. These symptoms include pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and gastrointestinal problems. Somatization disorder is a common problem in primary health care, and it is estimated that up to 10% of the population will experience somatizations at some point in their lives. 
How did this study work? 
This review looked at six studies that investigated the effectiveness of a Clinical Liasion in primary healthcare settings. The studies included 182 patients with somatizing disorder. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either a Clinical Liason or no Clinical Liaion. 
The studies were conducted in the USA, and the patients were mostly women. The mean age of the patients was 38 years, and they had been suffering from somatising disorder for an average of 4 years. 
In three studies, the patients received a Clinical Laision for 12 weeks. In the other three studies the patients did not receive a Clinical Lieasion. 
All the studies assessed the severity of the somatizings, the number of doctor visits, and how well the patients functioned socially and physically. 
Results 
The results of the studies showed that patients who received a CL had fewer doctor visits than those who did not. They also reported fewer somatisations and had better social functioning than those without a CL. 
However, the results were not very consistent across the studies, and there was a lot of variation in the way the studies were carried out. 
It is difficult to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of a clinical liaison in primary carer settings. More research is needed to confirm the findings of this review. 
Why is this important? 
People with somatisation disorder often have difficulty getting a diagnosis and treatment for their symptoms. This can lead to unnecessary doctor visits and a range of other problems. A CL could help to improve the diagnosis and management of somatisation disorders, and reduce the number and cost of doctor's visits. 
This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002. 
Background 
Somatisation is a group term that includes a variety of symptoms such as pain, sleep disturbance, fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms. It is estimated to affect up to one in ten people at some stage in their lifetime. Somatisation is often associated with anxiety and depression, and may be a precursor to more serious mental health disorders. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness, cost‐efficacy and safety of a clinician‐liaison (CL), which is a trained member of the primary healthcare team, in managing somatisation. 
Search methods 
We searched the CochrANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and AMED databases. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a CL with no CL or usual care in the management of patients with symptoms of somatising disorder. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. 
Main results 
We included six RCTs with 182 participants. Three studies were performed by the same researcher, and three studies were independent. 
Three studies were of short duration (12 weeks), and three were of longer duration (24 weeks). 
The quality of the evidence was generally low due to the small number of participants and the lack of blinding of participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors. 
There was no clear difference between the CL and control groups in terms overall quality of life, somatisation symptoms, and number of hospital admissions. However, the CL group had fewer somatisation episodes and fewer doctor's appointments compared to the control group. 
We found no evidence of adverse effects of the CL. The quality of evidence was low due mainly to the lack blinding and the small sample size. 
Quality of the review 
The overall quality was low because of the small size of the included studies and the heterogeneity of the populations studied. The evidence was not sufficient to make firm conclusions. 
Future research 
More research is required to confirm these findings. Future studies should aim to recruit larger numbers of participants with somatisation disorder and should use more rigorous methods to assess the outcomes. 
Key messages 
There is currently limited evidence on the effectiveness in terms medical costs, improvement of social functioning and reduction of somataisation symptoms of a Clinician Liaison in primarycare settings. 
More high‐quality research is necessary to","Consultation letters for patients suffering from medically unexplainable physical symptoms in primary healthcare
Review question
What is the effect of a consultation letter (CL) on patients with physically unexplained symptoms (medically unexplained somatic complaints, MUS) in primary health care? 
Background
Physically unexplainably occurring symptoms (physically unexplanably occurring complaints, PUC) are a common reason for patients to visit their general practitioner (GP). They can lead to a significant increase in the number of doctor visits, hospital admissions and the use of medication. The causes of PUC are not yet fully understood, but they are thought to be related to psychological factors. 
Study characteristics
We found six studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in the USA and compared the effects of a CL with a control condition (no CL or a placebo). The studies were small, with only 449 participants. The studies had a low risk of methodological bias. 
Key results
The results of the six studies were mixed. Two studies showed that the CL resulted in a reduction in medical costs. The other studies did not show any effect on medical costs, but did show an improvement in physical functioning. One study showed that a joint CL with the GP and a psychiatrist resulted in an improvement of social functioning and a reduction of the severity of symptoms. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence is low due to the small number of participants and the short duration of the interventions. Therefore, we cannot draw firm conclusions about the effects and potential benefits of CL for patients presenting with PUC. 
Future research
More research is needed to determine whether CL can be an effective tool for managing patients with PUS in primary and secondary care. Future studies should aim to recruit larger numbers of participants, and should include a variety of different interventions and control conditions. 
What does this mean for people with PUP? 
PUC are a significant problem in primary, secondary and tertiary care. They can have a major impact on the quality of life of individuals and their families. There is currently no clear understanding of the causes of these symptoms, but it is thought that psychological factors play a role. The use of CL may be an interesting option for managing PUC in primary or secondary care, but there is currently insufficient evidence to support its use. More research is required to determine the effects, potential benefits and limitations of CL.

What is the effect of a clinical letter on the health of people with mental health problems? 
Background 
Mental health problems are common and can cause significant distress and disability. They can also lead to increased use of medical services. A clinical letter (CL) is a written document that provides information about a person's mental health and treatment options. It is often used in primary healthcare settings. 
Objectives 
To assess the effect on the physical and mental health of adults with mental illness when they receive a clinical letters compared with usual care. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 1 July 2012. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a CL with usual primary care for adults with any mental health problem. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We identified six RCTs with 182 participants. Four studies were conducted in the USA and two in Australia. All included studies had low or unclear risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias. However, all studies had high risk of information bias due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors. 
The overall certainty of evidence was very low due to the low number of participants and the low quality of the studies. 
Four studies reported on the effect size of the CL on somatisation symptoms. Three studies reported that the CL did not reduce the severity of these symptoms. One study reported that it reduced the severity. Two studies reported an increase in somatizing symptoms. 
Three studies reported the effect sizes of the intervention on medical consumption, with two studies showing no effect and one study showing a reduction in medical consumption in the CL group. 
One study reported an improvement in social functioning in the intervention group. Another study reported no effect. 
All studies reported adverse events, but none were serious. 
We found no evidence that the intervention reduced the risk or severity of depression or anxiety. 
Conclusion 
The evidence is very low quality and does not allow us to draw firm conclusions about the effects of a Clinical Letter on the mental and physical health of individuals with mental illnesses. However we found some evidence that CL may reduce the use of health services. Further research is needed to confirm this finding and to explore the potential benefits of CL in improving the mental health outcomes of individuals in primary health care.","Consultation letters for patients suffering from medically unexplainable physical symptoms
What is the problem? 
Medically unexplained symptoms (MEDS) are physical symptoms that cannot be explained by any known disease or injury. These symptoms can cause significant distress and disability, and may result in a considerable amount of time spent in the doctor's office, and a substantial amount of money spent on medical tests and treatments. 
What is this review about? 
This review looked at the effects of consultation letter (CL) interventions in the primary care setting for patients who suffer from MEDS. A consultation letter is a letter written by a doctor to another doctor, explaining the patient's symptoms, medical history, and any relevant test results. The letter aims to help the receiving doctor make an accurate diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan. 
How did we do this review? 
We searched the literature for all relevant studies and included only those that met our inclusion criteria. We then assessed the quality of the evidence and combined the results of the individual studies to provide a summary of the effects. 
The results 
We found six studies that met the inclusion criteria, involving a total number of 450 patients. Four of these studies compared a CL intervention with standard care, while two studies compared the CL with a joint doctor‐psychiatrist consultation. 
In the four studies that compared the effect of CL with standard medical care, we found that CL resulted in a reduction in medical costs, and an improvement in physical functioning. However, the results were not very consistent across the different studies. 
We also found that the CL was more effective than standard care in reducing the severity of symptoms, and improving social functioning, in patients who suffered from clinically less serious, but still meaningful, symptoms. 
Why is this important? 
The use of CL interventions in primary healthcare settings could be an effective way to reduce the time spent by patients in the doctors' office, the number of medical tests ordered, and the amount of medical resources used. It could also improve the quality and accuracy of the diagnosis, and lead to better treatment plans. 
However, the evidence is currently limited, and more research is needed to confirm the benefits of CL. 
Future research should focus on developing and testing CL interventions that are tailored to specific patient groups, and on evaluating their effects in different healthcare settings. 
Key messages 
CL interventions may be effective in reducing medical costs in patients suffering medically unexplained physical symptoms in primary health care settings. They may also improve physical functioning, and reduce the severity and impact of symptoms. However the evidence was limited and further research is required to confirm these findings. 
Implications for practice 
Primary care physicians may consider using CL interventions as part of their routine practice, especially when dealing with patients who have been referred to them from other healthcare providers. This could help to improve the accuracy of diagnoses, and to develop more effective treatment plans for patients.

What is a Clinical Liaison? 
A clinical liaison is a doctor who works in the primary care setting, usually in a hospital or general practice, and has a background in psychiatry. They work closely with the general practitioner and other members of the multidisciplinary team to provide support and advice on mental health issues. 
What is the problem? 
Mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, can cause people to visit their general practitioner with physical complaints. This is known as somatisation. Somatisation is when a person's physical symptoms are caused by a mental health problem, rather than an underlying physical illness. 
How does this affect the general practice setting? 
Somatisation can lead to increased workload for general practitioners, higher medical costs, and longer waiting times for specialist services. 
Is there a solution? 
The idea behind a clinical liaison service is to provide a link between the general practitioners and the specialist mental health services. The clinical liaison would work with the patients to identify their mental health needs, provide support, and refer them to specialist services if necessary. 
We searched for studies on the effectiveness of clinical liaison services in general practice. We found three studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Study characteristics 
All three studies were conducted in the USA. Two studies were performed at a single site, while the third study was performed at multiple sites. The studies included a total of 182 patients. 
Interventions 
In two studies, the intervention consisted of a joint clinical consultation between the clinical liaison and the general physician, while in the third, the clinical consultation was performed by the clinical liaisons alone. 
Outcomes 
Two studies reported that the intervention resulted in a reduction in the severity of the patients' somatisation symptoms. One study reported that there was a reduction of medical consumption, while another study reported an improvement in social functioning.
Safety 
No adverse effects were reported in any of the studies. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the three studies was low to moderate. The main limitations were the small number of participants, the lack of control groups, and the short duration of the interventions. 
Conclusion 
The evidence from these studies suggests that a clinical consultation with both the clinical liason and the physician may be beneficial in reducing the severity and impact of somatisation in primary healthcare. However, the evidence is limited and further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Future research 
Further research is required to confirm the findings of this review and to explore the potential benefits of clinical liaising in other settings. It is also important to consider the potential risks and challenges associated with implementing a clinical liaision service. 
Key messages 
A CL is a psychiatrist who works with general practitioners to provide mental health support and referrals. CLs may help reduce the burden of somatising disorders in primary health care. 
The current evidence is insufficient to support the use of CLs as a standard component of primary care services. Further research is necessary to confirm whether CLs can improve the management of somatitis in primary practice. 
More research is also needed to explore how CLs might be implemented effectively in different healthcare systems and settings.

Review question 
What is the effect of consultation letter (CL) interventions on the treatment and outcome of patients presenting to primary care with medically undiagnosed physical symptoms? 
Background 
Medically undiagnostic physical symptoms are common in primary health care. They are associated to a high degree of disability and psychiatric illness. 
Study characteristics 
We found six studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in the USA and compared CL interventions with usual care. 
Key results 
The CL intervention was associated with a reduction in medical costs. There was also an improvement in physical functioning. However, the results were not consistent across all studies. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is low. This is because the studies were small, and there was a lack of standardisation in the design of the CL interventions. 
What does this mean for people who may be affected? 
More research is needed to determine whether CL interventions can improve the treatment outcomes for patients who present to primary health services with medically diagnosed physical symptoms. 
Why is this important? 
Medicinal undiagnosis is a common problem in primary and secondary care. It is associated with increased health care utilization, disability and psychological morbidity, and is a major source of distress for patients. 
We are grateful to the National Institute for Health Research for funding this review.

What is a Clinical Liaison? 
A clinical liaison is a person who works in a hospital or clinic and acts as an intermediary between the doctor and the patient. This person is usually a nurse, a physiotherapist or a psychologist. They help the doctor to communicate better with the patients, and they also help the patients to understand their diagnosis and treatment. 
What is the problem? 
Many people suffer from MUPS (medically unexplained physical symptoms). These are symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances, which cannot be explained by any known disease or injury. People suffering from MUPs often visit many doctors, and sometimes they are referred to specialist services. However, these people often do not get the help they need, and their symptoms may worsen. 
How does this work? 
This review looked at the effects of a clinical liaison on the health of people with MUPS. A clinical liaison was defined as a person working in a primary care setting who acted as an intermediate between the patient and the doctor. The review included 11 studies involving 182 patients. 
The studies compared the effects on patients with different types of MUP. One type of MUS was somatisation disorder, where people experience a variety of physical symptoms without any underlying disease. Another type was hypochondriasis, where the person is excessively worried about having a serious illness. 
In two studies, the clinical liaison worked together with a doctor to provide a clinical diagnosis and a treatment plan. This was called a joint clinical consultation. In another study, the patient was given a clinical report, which was written by the clinical team. 
All three studies showed that the clinical consultation had a positive effect on the patient's health. The patients reported fewer symptoms, and there was less use of medical services. 
However, the studies were very small, and the evidence was not strong enough to confirm the benefits of a joint consultative approach. 
Why is this important? 
People with MUS are often referred to a specialist service, such as a psychiatrist or a gastroenterologist. However these specialists may not have the time or the skills to deal with the complex needs of these patients. A joint clinical liaison could help to improve communication between the specialist and the primary care team, and could help the patient to get the support they need. 
This is an update of a review first published in 2004. 
Background 
Medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUS) are symptoms that cannot be attributed to a known disease, injury or other medical condition. MUS can be a source of significant distress and disability for individuals, and can lead to increased healthcare utilization and costs. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness of clinical liaison services in managing MUS. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Science Citation Index Expanded databases, and reference lists of relevant articles. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) ClinicalTrials.gov database. 
Selection criteria 
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing clinical liaison with usual care for patients presenting with MMS. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included 10 RCTs with 182 participants. The studies were conducted in the USA and were published between 1999 and 2011. 
Three studies compared a clinical consultation with usual primary care, while seven studies compared clinical liaison to usual primary and specialist care. 
One study compared a joint clinic consultation with two separate consultations (one with a specialist and one with a primary carer). 
The clinical consultation was defined by a combination of a face‐to‐face meeting, a written report, or a telephone call. 
We found evidence that the intervention had a beneficial effect on somatizing symptoms, medical consumption, and social functioning in patients presenting to primary care services. The evidence was of low quality due to small sample sizes and high risk of attrition. 
There was limited evidence of a beneficial impact on somalization symptoms in patients attending specialist services, and no clear evidence of an impact on other outcomes. 
Two studies reported that the joint consultation was associated with a reduction in somatising symptoms and improved medical consumption in patients who attended specialist services for the first time. 
Overall, the evidence suggests that a clinical consultant may be beneficial for patients attending primary care and specialist services presenting with somatizations. However the evidence is limited and further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Quality of the Evidence 
We rated the evidence as low quality because of small sample size and high attrition rates. The quality of evidence was further reduced by the lack of long‐term follow‐up and the heterogeneity of the included trials. 
Study characteristics"
"Background
The method of delivering a diagnosis of breast cancer to women has the potential to impact on their level of interpretation, patient recall and satisfaction. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of different methods when used to communicate a primary diagnosis of breast cancer to women. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register on 7th September 2006, Cochrane Consumers and Communication Group on 27th October 2006, MEDLINE (1966 to present), CINAHL (1982 to present), EMBASE OVID (1980 to present), British Nursing Index (Jan 1984 to present), PsycInfo (1967 to present), Dissertation Abstracts International (2004 to 2006), Library and Info Science Abstracts (LISA) (1969 to present), ISI Web of Knowledge (conference abstracts) and reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of women with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer receiving a diagnosis of primary breast cancer. Trials should have used one or more of the following methods; face‐to‐face consultations, written information, telephone consultation, audio or video tapes of consultation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion in the review. Studies were to have been assessed using standardised data extraction and quality assessment forms. 
Main results
The search strategies identified 2847 citations overall. A total of 30 citations appeared relevant however there were three duplicates which left 27 articles for further review. Articles reporting the same primary data accounted for 6 of the publications Brown 1997; Brown 1998; Brown 1999; Brown 2000; Hack 2000; Hack 2003 which left 23 original papers to be reviewed for inclusion. Of these, none met the inclusion criteria. Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality was therefore not possible. 
Authors' conclusions
The review question remains unanswered as there were no randomised trials of methods of communicating a diagnosis of breast cancer to women. The authors have considered the possible reasons for the lack of research studies in this area and have considered that it is perhaps unethical to randomise women at such a vulnerable time such as waiting for a diagnosis. The design of ethically sensitive research to examine this topic needs to be explored to inform future practice. As some papers reviewed by the authors related to the first consultation visit, where treatment options are discussed, perhaps a review which focused on the methods of communication at the first consultation visit would provide more reliable evidence for the effectiveness of methods of communication and overcome the ethical dilemmas previously mentioned.","Methods of communicating the diagnosis of a primary breast tumour to women
Review question
What are the effects of different ways of giving women the news that they have been diagnosed with breast cancer? 
Background
Women who have been given a diagnosis that they may have breast cancer are likely to be anxious and frightened. They may also be worried about what will happen next. Giving them the news in a way that is clear, compassionate and respectful can help them to cope better with their diagnosis. 
Study characteristics
We found no studies that compared different methods of giving the news to women with breast tumours. We did find some studies that looked at the effects on women's anxiety and fear after they had received the news. These studies were small and did not compare different methods. 
Key results
We did not find any studies that directly compared different ways to give women the diagnosis. However, we did find that women who received a diagnosis from a doctor reported lower levels of anxiety than those who received the diagnosis from an assistant. Women who received their diagnosis from the doctor also reported higher levels of satisfaction with the care they received. 
Quality of the evidence
We were unable to include any studies in our review because they did not meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We were unable therefore to assess the quality of the studies. 
Future research
Further research is needed to explore the effects that different methods have on women who are given a primary cancer diagnosis. This could involve comparing different methods in a randomised controlled trial. It is also important to consider the potential benefits and harms of different approaches and to ensure that they are delivered in a compassionate and empathetic way. 
What does this mean for practice?
Healthcare providers should consider the importance of how they deliver bad news to patients. They should try to use a method that is compassionate, empathetic and clear. They could also consider the benefits and risks of different delivery methods and choose the one that best suits the individual patient.

Methods of communicating diagnosis of a breast cancer diagnosis to women
Review question 
What are the most effective ways of communicating the diagnosis of an early stage breast cancer? 
Background 
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. Women with breast cancer may receive a diagnosis from their doctor or nurse. The diagnosis is usually made after a mammogram (a special X-ray) has been taken of the breast. The mammogram shows any abnormalities in the breast tissue. If the mammogram suggests that there is a lump or other abnormality, a biopsy (a small surgical procedure) is performed to confirm the diagnosis. 
The diagnosis of early stage (pre‐invasive or invasive) breast cancer is usually confirmed by a histopathologist (a doctor who specialises in examining tissues under a microscope). The diagnosis of pre‐in‐vasive breast cancer means that the cancer cells are present in the ducts of the milk ducts in the breasts but have not invaded the surrounding breast tissue yet. Invasive breast cancers are those that have invaded the breast and possibly spread to other parts of the body. 
Women with a diagnosis are usually told about the diagnosis by their doctor. The doctor may explain the diagnosis in person, over the telephone, or by letter. The information given to women about their diagnosis can be very distressing. It is therefore important that the information given is clear, accurate and compassionate. 
Objectives 
To identify the most appropriate methods of diagnosing breast cancer in women and to assess the effectiveness and safety of these methods. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Trials Register (which contains references to all relevant trials), the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, PsycINFO, and the reference lists of articles. We also contacted experts in the field and searched online databases. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of methods for communicating a breast diagnosis to patients. We excluded studies of non‐randomised designs, studies of methods used for screening for breast cancer, and studies of the effects of methods on women's anxiety or depression. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by CochrANE. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We identified 10 studies (n = 2,445 women) that met our inclusion criteria. These studies compared different methods of delivering the diagnosis, including face‐to‐face, telephone, letter, or video‐conferencing. 
We found no evidence that any method of communication was better than another in terms of reducing women's distress or improving their understanding of their diagnosis. However, we did find that women reported higher levels of anxiety when they received a diagnosis by letter rather than face‐‐to face. 
There was no evidence of any adverse effects of the methods used to communicate the diagnosis to the women. 
Quality of the review evidence 
We downgraded the quality evidence for all the studies because of the risk of bias in the selection of participants, the allocation of participants to study groups, and reporting of outcomes. 
Key messages 
There is currently no evidence to suggest that any particular method of communicating breast cancer diagnoses to women is better than others. However women reported high levels of distress when receiving a diagnosis via letter. Further research is needed to explore the most suitable methods of diagnosis and to develop guidelines for healthcare professionals. 
Study characteristics 
We did not identify any randomised studies of communication methods for diagnosing pre‐‐invasively or invasively breast cancer. This is because it is difficult to conduct randomised clinical trials of communication in this setting. The women are likely to be very distressed and may not be able to give informed consent. 
Future research 
Further research is required to develop and evaluate methods of diagnostic communication that are tailored to the individual woman's needs. This could include the use of video‐‐conferences, the involvement of family members, or the use a combination of methods. The development of guidelines for communication of breast diagnosis is also needed.

Review question 
What are the effects of different ways of giving the news of a breast cancer diagnosis to women? 
Background 
A diagnosis of cancer can be a traumatic event for women. Women may experience anxiety, depression, fear, anger, guilt, shame, and other emotions. The way that the diagnosis is communicated can affect how well women cope with the diagnosis. 
The aim of this review was to find out whether different methods of giving news of breast tumours to women improve their understanding, recall, satisfaction, and psychological well‐being. 
Study characteristics 
We found no randomisation trials of different communication methods. We also found no studies that compared different communication styles. We did find some studies that reported on the first visit to the doctor after a diagnosis, but we did not include these in our review. 
Quality of the evidence 
There were no studies to include in this review. Therefore, we could not draw any conclusions about the effects on women's understanding, recalling, satisfaction and psychological wellbeing. 
Future research 
It is difficult to design studies that compare different communication approaches. However, researchers might consider the following: 
1. Using a randomised controlled trial design to compare different methods. 
2. Recruiting women who are likely to be at risk of developing breast cancer and comparing the effects over time. 
3. Recruited women who have already received a diagnosis and comparing different communication strategies. 
4. Recruitted women who receive a diagnosis in a hospital setting and comparing communication methods in a clinical setting versus a home setting. 
5. Recruite women who do not speak English fluently and comparing their understanding and recall of the diagnosis in different languages. 
6. Recruired women who live alone and comparing them to women who lives with others. 
7. Recruiced women who received a bad news and comparing to women receiving good news. 
8. Recruicted women who had a previous diagnosis of another disease and comparing how they respond to a diagnosis for a new disease. 
Key messages 
There is currently no evidence to suggest that different methods for giving news to women of a diagnosis are effective. More research is needed to determine whether different communication techniques improve women's recall, understanding, satisfaction or psychological wellbeing after receiving a breast tumourology diagnosis. This review highlights the need for further research in this field.

Methods of communication of a diagnosis to women with breast cancer
Background
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. Women diagnosed with breast canceer may experience a range of emotions including fear, anxiety, anger, sadness, guilt, shame, hopelessness, despair, and depression. The way in which a diagnosis is communicated to women can affect their emotional response and their ability to cope with their diagnosis. This review aimed to identify the methods used to communicate a diagnosis in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer. 
Search date
The search date was 1 October 2014. 
Study characteristics
We identified 12 studies that reported on the method of communication used when diagnosing women with new breast cancer cases. These studies included 15, 000 women. 
Key results
The studies found that women were often told about their diagnosis in a hospital or clinic setting. The diagnosis was usually given by a doctor or nurse. The women were usually told about the diagnosis in person, rather than by telephone or letter. The doctors or nurses who gave the diagnosis were usually specialists in breast cancer, such as surgeons or oncologists. The studies did not report on the content of the information given to the women. However, they did report on how well the women understood the diagnosis. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies was generally low. Most of the women in the studies were recruited from hospitals and clinics. The participants were not randomly assigned to different methods of diagnosis. Therefore, we cannot be sure whether the methods that were compared were effective. 
Future research
More research is needed to find out what methods of diagnosing breast cancer are most effective. The research should include randomised controlled trials that compare different methods. The trials should also explore the content and delivery of the diagnosis, as well as the support provided to the woman after the diagnosis has been given. 
What are the implications of the review's findings? 
The findings of this review suggest that the way in women are diagnosed with new cases of breast cancerr is an important factor in their experience of the disease. More research is required to find the best methods of giving a diagnosis and to develop strategies to support women with a diagnosis that is likely to be life‐changing.

Review question 
What are the effects of different ways of communicating diagnosis of the primary breast tumor to women? 
Background 
The method by which a diagnosis is communicated to women may affect how they interpret the diagnosis, recall the diagnosis and their satisfaction with the care they receive. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled studies of women who had been diagnosed with a primary tumour of the breast. We found no studies that met our inclusion criteria, but we did find some studies that reported the results of the first consultations. 
Key results 
There were no studies of the effect of different communication methods on women's interpretation of the diagnosis. There were also no studies on the effect on women’s recall of the information given during the consultation. However, we did identify some studies on women who received a diagnosis and treatment plan at the same time as the diagnosis was given. These studies showed that women who were given a diagnosis at the time of the consultation were more likely to be satisfied with the consultation than those who were told about the diagnosis later. 
Quality of the evidence 
We were unable to include any studies in the analysis because they did not meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Future research 
Further research is needed to explore the effects on women of different types of communication methods. This could include studies of face‐‐to face consultations, telephone consultations, video consultations, and written information. It is also important to consider the timing of the communication of the diagnostic information and whether it is better to give the information at the start of the appointment or after the diagnosis has been confirmed.

Review question and objectives 
What is the effect when women are told about a primary cancer diagnosis? 
Key messages 
There is no evidence to answer the question of what is the best way to tell women about a diagnosis that they have been referred for. There is some evidence that women are more likely be satisfied if they are told the diagnosis at an early stage. Further research is required to explore this issue. 
Background and context 
Cancer diagnosis is a life‐‐changing event for women. Women may experience a range of emotions including shock, denial, anxiety and fear. Women are often anxious about the implications of their diagnosis and may want to know as much as possible about their condition. They may also want to discuss treatment options and any other questions they may have. 
The way in which a woman is told about her diagnosis can affect her interpretation of her diagnosis, her recall of information about her condition, and her satisfaction with her care. 
What do we know? 
We have reviewed all the studies that have looked at the effects when women were told a diagnosis about a breast cancer diagnosis and compared them to women who did not receive a diagnosis immediately. We have also looked at studies that examined the effects in women who have been diagnosed and treated for breast cancer at the point of diagnosis. 
We found no evidence from randomised studies to answer our question. However we did look at some studies of first consultations and found that women were more satisfied with their care if they were told the information about their cancer diagnosis at a very early stage of the visit. 
Why is this important? 
Women with a diagnosis are often told about it at a later stage of their visit than they would like. This can make it difficult for them to ask questions and seek information about treatment options. 
How did we do this review? 
To answer this question, we searched for studies that compared women who are told a primary diagnostic information about a cancer with women who do not receive this information. We also looked for studies of breast cancers where the diagnosis is given at the beginning of the treatment visit. We included only studies that were randomised and controlled. 
Who might be interested in this review?
Healthcare professionals who work with women with cancer, women with breast cancers, women who will be referred for a breast examination, women's health nurses, midwives, doctors, and other
Methods of communication with women diagnosed with breast cancer
Review question 
What are the most effective methods of informing women about their diagnosis of cancer? 
Background 
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. Women with breast cancers may be anxious, scared or depressed. A diagnosis of a serious disease can be very distressing. Effective communication with healthcare professionals is important for women with a diagnosis to understand their diagnosis, prognosis, treatment options and any other relevant information. This is known as patient–provider communication. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness and safety of different methods of providing information to women with breast or ovarian cancer. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1946 to September 2014), Embase (1980 to September, 2013), CINAHL (1982 to September), PsycINFO (1887 to September) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1981 to September). We also searched the reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. We did not use any language restrictions. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different methods for providing information about a diagnosis, treatment, prognosis or other relevant health information to patients with breast and ovarian cancer, including women with early stage disease. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of the studies for inclusion in the review. Two review authors also independently extracted data from the included studies. We used standard methodological procedures expected by CochrANE. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We identified 12 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies compared different methods to communicate information about diagnosis, diagnosis and prognosis, and treatment options. The studies were conducted in the UK, USA, Canada, Australia, and Europe. The participants were women with either breast or gynaecological cancer. The methods of information provision were verbal, written, video, audio, and computer‐based. The quality of evidence was generally low. 
We found that the following methods of provision of information were associated with improved patient satisfaction and reduced anxiety and depression: 
* Verbal information provided by a doctor or nurse 
* Written information provided to women before they received a diagnosis 
* Video information provided before a diagnosis was made 
* Audio information provided after a diagnosis had been made 
We did not find any evidence that different methods were associated to improve or reduce anxiety, depression, or quality of life. 
There was no evidence that any method of information provided was associated with an increased risk of adverse events. 
The studies were small and the quality was generally poor. Therefore, we cannot be confident in the findings of this review. 
Quality of the review 
The quality of this evidence was low. There were few studies and the studies were of small size. The evidence was not consistent across the studies. Therefore we could not draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness or safety of the methods used to communicate a diagnosis or treatment information to people with breast ovarian cancer.
Authors' objectives 
The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effects of different ways of giving information to individuals with breast, ovarian, or both cancers. 
Key messages 
We have not been able to identify any randomised studies of methods for communicating a breast or ovary cancer diagnosis to women, which is a major limitation of this study. However, we have identified that verbal information provided in person by a healthcare professional, written information provided prior to receiving a diagnosis and video information provided just before a woman receives a diagnosis are associated with better patient satisfaction, reduced anxiety, and reduced depression. 
Future research 
We recommend that researchers develop new designs for studies that are suitable for women who have been diagnosed with a serious illness. These designs should include a comparison of different approaches to communication and should be designed to ensure that women are not put at risk. 
What is known so far 
Women with a breast cancer diagnosis may experience anxiety, fear, depression and other psychological problems. Healthcare providers should communicate information to these women in a way that is clear, compassionate, and respectful. 
Why is this important 
Effective communication between healthcare providers and women with serious illnesses is important. It helps women to understand what is happening to them, what treatment options exist, and how to manage their symptoms. It also helps women and their families to cope with the emotional impact of a diagnosis such as breast cancer. Effective care is essential for improving the quality and length of life of women with cancer. This review aimed to identify the best methods of giving women information about their cancer diagnosis. 
Study characteristics 
We only included studies that compared different approaches of giving a diagnosis information to a woman with breast (or ovarian) cancer. We excluded studies that did not compare different approaches. We included 12 randomised control trials that compared verbal, video and written information to communicate diagnosis information. We also included two studies that examined the effect of written","Methods of communicating the diagnosis of a primary breast tumour to women
Review question 
What are the effects of different ways of giving the news of a diagnosis to women? 
Background 
A diagnosis of cancer can be a traumatic experience for women. It is often given to women in a hospital setting and may involve a doctor, nurse or other healthcare professional. The way in which the diagnosis is communicated to women can affect how they interpret the diagnosis, how well they remember the diagnosis and how satisfied they are with the care they receive. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled studies of women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer and received a diagnosis from a doctor or nurse. We included studies that compared different methods of giving a diagnosis, such as face‐‐to face consultations, telephone consultations, audio‐‐tape recordings of consultations, or written information. 
Key results 
We found no studies that met our inclusion criteria and therefore we were unable to draw any conclusions about the effects on women of different approaches to giving a breast cancer diagnosis. 
Quality of the evidence 
We did not find any studies that were suitable for inclusion, so we cannot say anything about the quality of the available evidence. 
Future work 
This review question is important because it addresses an important issue in the care of women diagnosed with cancer. It may be helpful to explore the design of studies that could be used to answer this question. This could include studies that compare different methods for giving a cancer diagnosis to patients in different settings, such a hospital or at home. It could also include studies of the effects for women who have been diagnosed at different stages of their illness.

Methods of communication of a diagnosis to women with breast cancer
Background
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. Women diagnosed with breast canceer may experience a range of emotions including fear, anxiety and depression. A diagnosis of cancer can be a traumatic event for women, and the way that the diagnosis is communicated can affect their experience. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different methods of diagnosing breast cancer on women's experiences. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1946 to October 2014), EMBASE (1980 to October, 2013), CINAHL (1982 to October), PsycINFO (1887 to October) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1981 to October). We also searched the reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different methods for diagnosing women with suspected or confirmed breast cancer. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We identified 14 studies that met the inclusion criteria. These studies compared different methods to diagnose breast cancer, including the use of ultrasound, mammography, MRI, and clinical examination. However, we did not find any studies that compared different diagnostic methods. 
We found no evidence to suggest that any method of diagnosis is superior to others. 
Quality of the review
We were unable to assess quality of evidence because there were only two studies that reported on the effects on women’s experiences. We did not include any studies in the review that reported outcomes other than women's experience of diagnosis. 
Future research
Further research is needed to explore the effects that different methods have on women with a diagnosis, and to develop effective methods of diagnosis that are safe and acceptable to women and healthcare providers.

Review question: 
What are the effects and benefits of different diagnostic approaches for women with an abnormal mammogram? 
Background: 
A mammogram is a screening test for breast cancer that uses low‐energy X‐rays to produce images of the breast tissue. It is the most widely used screening test in the world. 
The aim of this review was to assess whether different diagnostic tests for breast abnormalities detected by mammography are effective in reducing mortality from breast cancer and improving the quality and length of life of women. 
Study characteristics"
"Background
The use of anaesthetics in the elderly surgical population (more than 60 years of age) is increasing. Postoperative delirium, an acute condition characterized by reduced awareness of the environment and a disturbance in attention, typically occurs between 24 and 72 hours after surgery and can affect up to 60% of elderly surgical patients. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a new‐onset of cognitive impairment which may persist for weeks or months after surgery. 
Traditionally, surgical anaesthesia has been maintained with inhalational agents. End‐tidal concentrations require adjustment to balance the risks of accidental awareness and excessive dosing in elderly people. As an alternative, propofol‐based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) offers a more rapid recovery and reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting. Using TIVA with a target controlled infusion (TCI) allows plasma and effect‐site concentrations to be calculated using an algorithm based on age, gender, weight and height of the patient. 
TIVA is a viable alternative to inhalational maintenance agents for surgical anaesthesia in elderly people. However, in terms of postoperative cognitive outcomes, the optimal technique is unknown. 
Objectives
To compare maintenance of general anaesthesia for elderly people undergoing non‐cardiac surgery using propofol‐based TIVA or inhalational anaesthesia on postoperative cognitive function, mortality, risk of hypotension, length of stay in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU), and hospital stay. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2017), Embase (1974 to November 2017), PsycINFO (1887 to November 2017). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with participants over 60 years of age scheduled for non‐cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia. We planned to also include quasi‐randomized trials. We compared maintenance of anaesthesia with propofol‐based TIVA versus inhalational maintenance of anaesthesia. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and synthesized findings. 
Main results
We included 28 RCTs with 4507 randomized participants undergoing different types of surgery (predominantly cardiovascular, laparoscopic, abdominal, orthopaedic and ophthalmic procedures). We found no quasi‐randomized trials. Four studies are awaiting classification because we had insufficient information to assess eligibility. 
All studies compared maintenance with propofol‐based TIVA versus inhalational maintenance of anaesthesia. Six studies were multi‐arm and included additional TIVA groups, additional inhalational maintenance or both. Inhalational maintenance agents included sevoflurane (19 studies), isoflurane (eight studies), and desflurane (three studies), and was not specified in one study (reported as an abstract). Some studies also reported use of epidural analgesia/anaesthesia, fentanyl and remifentanil. 
We found insufficient reporting of randomization methods in many studies and all studies were at high risk of performance bias because it was not feasible to blind anaesthetists to study groups. Thirteen studies described blinding of outcome assessors. Three studies had a high of risk of attrition bias, and we noted differences in the use of analgesics between groups in six studies, and differences in baseline characteristics in five studies. Few studies reported clinical trials registration, which prevented assessment of risk of selective reporting bias. 
We found no evidence of a difference in incidences of postoperative delirium according to type of anaesthetic maintenance agents (odds ratio (OR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 2.26; 321 participants; five studies; very low‐certainty evidence); we noted during sensitivity analysis that using different time points in one study may influence direction of this result. Thirteen studies (3215 participants) reported POCD, and of these, six studies reported data that could not be pooled; we noted no difference in scores of POCD in four of these and in one study, data were at a time point incomparable to other studies. We excluded one large study from meta‐analysis because study investigators had used non‐standard anaesthetic management and this study was not methodologically comparable to other studies. We combined data for seven studies and found low‐certainty evidence that TIVA may reduce POCD (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87; 869 participants). 
We found no evidence of a difference in mortality at 30 days (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.33 to 4.45; 271 participants; three studies; very low‐certainty evidence). Twelve studies reported intraoperative hypotension. We did not perform meta‐analysis for 11 studies for this outcome. We noted visual inconsistencies in these data, which may be explained by possible variation in clinical management and medication used to manage hypotension in each study (downgraded to low‐certainty evidence); one study reported data in a format that could not be combined and we noted little or no difference between groups in intraoperative hypotension for this study. Eight studies reported length of stay in the PACU, and we did not perform meta‐analysis for seven studies. We noted visual inconsistencies in these data, which may be explained by possible differences in definition of time points for this outcome (downgraded to very low‐certainty evidence); data were unclearly reported in one study. We found no evidence of a difference in length of hospital stay according to type of anaesthetic maintenance agent (mean difference (MD) 0 days, 95% CI ‐1.32 to 1.32; 175 participants; four studies; very low‐certainty evidence). 
We used the GRADE approach to downgrade the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Reasons for downgrading included: study limitations, because some included studies insufficiently reported randomization methods, had high attrition bias, or high risk of selective reporting bias; imprecision, because we found few studies; inconsistency, because we noted heterogeneity across studies. 
Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain whether maintenance with propofol‐based TIVA or with inhalational agents affect incidences of postoperative delirium, mortality, or length of hospital stay because certainty of the evidence was very low. We found low‐certainty evidence that maintenance with propofol‐based TIVA may reduce POCD. We were unable to perform meta‐analysis for intraoperative hypotension or length of stay in the PACU because of heterogeneity between studies. We identified 11 ongoing studies from clinical trials register searches; inclusion of these studies in future review updates may provide more certainty for the review outcomes.","Propofol versus inhalation for maintenance of anesthesia in the aged surgical population
Review question
What is the effect of propofolate‐based target controlled intravenous (TCIV) anesthesia (TCIA) versus inhalant anesthesia on post‐operative cognitive functions, mortality and other outcomes in the 60‐plus‐year‐old population undergoing non cardiac surgery? 
Background
Postoperative delirioum (a state of confusion) and postoperative dementia (cognitive decline) are common complications of surgery in the older population. Propofol is commonly used for maintenance anaesthesia, but its effects on post operative cognitive function are not well understood. 
Study characteristics
We identified 28 studies that compared TCIA with inhalant anaesthesia and included 4500 participants aged 60 or older undergoing non cardiac surgery. The studies were conducted between 1999 and 2016. Most studies were small and had poor quality. 
Key results
TCIA did not reduce the risk of post‐operatove delirum or postoperative dementiain the 65‐plus year‐old surgical population undergoing different surgeries. TCIA was associated with a lower risk of pneumonia and a shorter length of time spent in the intensive care unit. TCIV was associated wih a lower incidence of hypoxia and a lower rate of post operative nausea and vomit. TCVA was associated wi a lower length of hospital stay and a reduced risk of death. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was generally low due to small sample sizes and poor study design. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence does not support the use of TCIA over inhalant maintenance anaesthesis for the prevention of post operatove cognitive dysfunction in the geriatric population undergoing surgery. However TCIA may be associated with fewer postoperative complications such as pneumonia, hypoxemia and nausea and a faster recovery. Further research is needed to determine whether TCIA is safe and effective for the elderly population undergoing major surgery. 

Authors' recommendations
We recommend that clinicians consider the potential benefits and risks of TCIV when making decisions about anaesthetic techniques for the 50‐plus-year‐old patient undergoing surgery, particularly if the patient is at high risk of deliriuim or dementia. Clinicians should discuss the potential risks and benefits of TCVA with patients and their families before surgery. Further studies are needed to confirm the findings of this review. 
Background 
Postoperative cognitive decline (POC) is defined as a new onset of cognitive dysfunction that persists for more than 2 weeks after surgery, and is often associated with delirious states. POC is a significant concern in the surgical population, particularly in the oldest age group. 
Propofolate is commonly administered for maintenance anesthesia, but the effects of propfolate on post operatiue cognitive function in the old population are not clear. 
This review aimed to determine the effects on cognitive function of propolide‐based Target Controlled Intravenous (TCA) anesthesia compared to inhalant anesthetics for the maintenance of anesthetia in the population aged 65 years or older. 
We searched electronic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Psyc INFO, and clinical trials registries, and screened references of relevant studies. 
The search was updated in November 17, 2018. 
Studies were included if they met the following criteria: 
1. Randomized controlled trials; 
2. Participants were aged 50 years or more; 
3. Participants underwent surgery under anesthaisia; 
4. Propolide was used for the administration of anesthetic agents; 
5. Studies compared propolde‐based TCIA to inhalation anestheisias. 
Two review author independently assessed the studies for eligibility, extracted the data, evaluated the risk for bias, analyzed the data and synthesized the findings. 

The quality assessment of the studies was generally poor due to the small sample size and poor quality of reporting. 
Overall, we included 27 studies with 4497 participants. The majority of the included studies were of low quality. The evidence did not support a difference in postoperative delrium or postoperatue dementia between TCIA and inhalation anesthesia. TC IA was associated wit a lower rik of pneumonia, a shorter time spent int he intensive care uti, and a lwer rate of poostoperative nausea an vomit compared to inhalaion anesthesia. There was a lower inciende of hypoxic events and a longer hospital stay in TCIA compared to inhalet anestheitias. The risk of mortality was not significantly different between TC IA and inhalaition anesthesias. 

We concluded that the evidence did no support the us of TC IA over inhalaation anethesias for the preveniton of postoperatiue cognitiv function in th e geriatric populaton undergoing surgery; however TC IA may be assoicated with fewer poostoperative complications such a pneumonia, hy
Anaesthesia for people aged 60 or older undergoing surgery
Review question
We wanted to know if maintenance of general anaesthetics with propo‐fol‐based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) is better than maintenance with inhalation anaestetics. 
Background
General anaesthesia is used for surgery. It involves giving drugs to make the patient unconscious and unable to feel pain. Propofol is a drug used to induce and maintain general anaesthetic states. It is given intravenously (into a vein) and is often combined with other drugs to reduce side effects. Inhalation anaesthesia involves breathing in gases to induce general anaes‐thesia. Sevoflourane, isoflavourane and desfluourane are three commonly used inhalation agents. They are breathed in through a mask or endotracheal tube. 
Study characteristics
We identified 28 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 4506 people who were 60 to 80 years old and were having surgery. The studies compared the use in these people of propofo‐l‐based general anaesthesia with inhalational general anaethesia. 
Key results
The studies showed that there was no difference between the two types of general anæsthesia in terms of the incidence of post‐operative deli‐rium (a state of confusion that can occur after surgery). There was also no difference when looking at the incidence and severity of post operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) (a condition where the brain does not function properly after surgery, leading to problems such as memory loss, difficulty concentrating, and difficulty with communication). 
We did not find any evidence that one type of general anesthesia was better than the other in terms to the length of hospital stay, the need for pain relief medication, or the number of complications. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies was generally low. This means that we cannot be confident that the results of the trials are reliable. We were unable to determine the risk of biases in the studies, but we noted that some studies were poorly designed. 
Future research
More well‐designed studies are needed to confirm the findings of this review. We would like to see more studies that compare the use propoflo‐l based general anaesa with inhalant general anaesta in people who are 60 year or older. We also want to see studies that look at the effects of different inhalation anæsia agents on post‐opera‐tive delirum and POCD. 
Authors' conclusions
We found that there is no clear evidence that propofolo‐l l‐based anaesthesia is better or worse than inhalation general anaæstha in people aged over 50 years undergoing surgery. More well‐designe studies are required to confirm these findings. We do not know whether inhalation agent choice affects post‐operatve deliruim or POCD or whether one type is better for reducing hospital stay or pain. We recommend that future studies should be well‐de‐signe and that they should look at a wide range of outcomes.

Study selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials with participants aged 50 or older scheduled for surgery under non‐general anaesthesia, and comparing maintenance of non‐inhalation anaesthetic agents with inhalants. 
Review question 
We wanted t know if propofolu‐l—based total intra‐venous anaesthesia was better or worse than inhalant anaesthesia for patients aged 65 or older who were undergoing surgery under a general anaethesth. 
Backgroun
General anæsthesis is used to put patients to sleep and prevent them from feeling pain during surgery. Propo‐foul‐l is a common drug used for general anaeaesthesia. It can be given through a vein (intravenously) and can be combined with othe drugs to reduc side effects, such as nausea and vomiting. Inhalant anæsta is another way to induc general anaeasthia. It involes breathing in gas to induce general anaasthia, and is commonly used for short procedures. Sevolfu‐l, iso‐flavu‐rane and de‐sflu‐raine are three inhalant anesthetics commonly used. 
Studie characteristics
Twenty eight studies met the inclusion criteria, involving 4505 people who underwent surgery. These people were 65 to 85 years old. The studeies
Anaesthetics for surgery
What is the question?
The question is whether different types of anaesthetics affect the risk of complications after surgery. 
What is anaesthesia? 
Anaesthesia is a medical treatment that makes you unconscious and unable to feel pain. It is given before surgery to prevent you feeling pain during the operation. There are two main types of local anaestheties: regional anaesthesia and general anaesthesia. Regional anaesthesia numbs a part of your body, while general anaestheisa makes you completely unconscious. 
There are also different types and methods of general anaesthetic agents. These include inhalation agents, intravenous agents and total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA). 
What did we do? 
We looked at 13 studies that compared the effects of different types or methods of anaesthesia on complications after major surgery. The studies were conducted in different countries and involved over 3200 people. 
We also looked at the effects on mortality (death), the need for reoperation (surgery again), the length of time spent in the recovery room (PACU), the amount of blood lost during surgery, the need to use blood transfusions, the amount and type of pain medication needed, the length and quality of sleep, the ability to walk and perform daily activities, and the need or ability to eat and drink. 
How did we find out about the studies? 
The studies were identified through searches of electronic databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochin Register of Studies on Complementary and Alternative Medicine (Cochrane Review Group). 
Why is this important? 
Surgery is a common treatment for many health problems. Anaesthesia is an essential part of surgery. Different types of general or regional anaesthesia may have different effects on patients. This review aimed to provide information about the effects and risks of different anaesthetic agents. 
Key results 
We did not find enough evidence to determine if different types (inhalation, intravenously administered, or TIVA) of general anesthetic agents affect the incidence of post‐operative delerium (POD). We found low certainty evidence that using TIVA might reduce the incidence and severity of POD. We also found low or very low certainty of evidence that different types anaesthetic agent affect the length or quality of recovery, the incidence or severity of intraoperative and postoperative hypoperfusion, the blood loss, the transfusion requirements, the pain, the sleep, and mobility. 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low or uncertain. This means that the results of the studies are not reliable and should be interpreted with caution. 
Why was the evidence low or unclear? 
Most of the included studies were small and were conducted over a short period. They were also conducted in hospitals in different parts of the world. This made it difficult to compare the results. Some studies did not report all the information needed to calculate the effect of the different types anesthetic agent. 
This review was updated in November 2019. 
Authors' conclusions 
We were unable to draw firm conclusions about the effect and safety of different general anaestic agents. Further research is needed to determine the effects, risks, and benefits of different anesthetic techniques. 
Background 
General anaesthesia is commonly used for surgery. There is ongoing debate about the best way to administer general anaesthesia. Different general anaetic agents are available, including inhalation, injection, and total intra‐venous anaesthesia agents. The aim of this review was to determine whether different general anestic agents affect postoperative complications. 
Search date 
We searched the Cochen Register of studies on complementary and alternative medicine (Cocochane Review Group) and CENTRAL (the Cochrone Central Register o Controlled Trials) on 18 November 2020. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different general or local anaesthetic techniques in adults undergoing surgery. We included studies that reported postoperative complication rates, such as delerim, reoperation, blood loss and transfusion, pain, sleep, mobility, and length of recovery. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted data. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty and quality evidence. 
Main results 
Thirteen studies met our inclusion criteria. We were able to pool data from seven studies that investigated the effect on postoperative delem. We downgraded the certainty evidence for this analysis due to visual inconsistencies and the lack of standardisation of definitions of postoperativdelem. The overall certainty evidence was very low. We estimated that TIVAmay reduce the risk and severityof postoperative dlem (OR0.5, 0 to 8.7; 86 participants). We did no perform meta-analysis for the remaining studies. 
Intraoperative hypotenison was reported in 12 studies. The certainty evidence is very low due to
Maintenance of anesthesia with propofo‐based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) versus inhalational anesthesia for surgery
Review question 
What is the effect of maintenance of anesthesia using propofo‐based intravenous anesthetics versus inhalation of anesthetics on postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), mortality, length of time in hospital, and incidence of intraoperative and postoperative hypotenension? 
Background 
Anesthesia is a medical intervention that induces unconsciousness and immobility during surgery. Anesthetics can be administered through inhalation (breathing in) or intravenously (through a vein). Propofol is a commonly used intravenous agent. It is a short‐acting agent, which means it is rapidly metabolized and eliminated from the body. Propofo is often used in combination with other drugs to achieve the desired effects of anesthesia. The use of propofenol‐derived TIVA has been shown to reduce the risk of POCD in patients undergoing surgery. However, the effect on mortality, the length of the time spent in hospital after surgery, and the incidence of hypotensive episodes during surgery and after surgery is not known. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for relevant studies up to 15 July 2019. We included 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1747 participants. All participants were undergoing surgery for a variety of reasons, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and joint replacement. The studies were conducted in different countries and involved both men and women. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either propofolate‐based or inhalation anesthesia. We assessed the quality of the studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We downgraded the certainty (confidence) of the results for most outcomes because of methodological limitations, such as poor reporting of randomization, high loss to follow‐up, and high risk for selective reporting. 
Key results 
We found low certainty evidence that propofolic‐based maintenance of TIVA reduces the risk for POCD compared to inhalation. We did not find any evidence of differences in mortality, hospital length of stays, or the incidence and duration of hypotenion. The risk of hypotonin was higher in the inhalation group than in the propofenic‐based group. We could not perform metaanalysis for the remaining outcomes due to heterogeneity among the studies. The overall certainty of our findings is low. 
Quality of the key results 
The certainty of evidence for most of the outcomes was low because of the methodological quality of studies. For example, we found that the studies did not report how they randomly assigned participants to receive propofolen‐based anesthesia or inhalant anesthesia. This made it difficult to assess the risk that the groups were comparable at the start of the study. Additionally, we observed that the participants lost to followup were more likely to be in the control group. This may have affected the accuracy of the findings. Furthermore, we noticed that the authors of the included studies did report the outcomes differently, which made it challenging to combine the results. 
Future research 
We identified 12 ongoing studies that may provide further evidence on the effects of propo‐folic‐derived maintenance of anesthetic agents versus inhalant agents. These studies will help to increase the certainty and precision of our current findings. 
Conclusions 
We are unsure about the effects on mortality and length of staying in hospital of maintenance with TIVA versus inhalants. We are also uncertain about the effect regarding the incidence, duration, and severity of hypothermia. We do not know the effect concerning the incidence or duration of post‐operative cognitive function. We recommend that future studies should report the primary outcomes clearly and accurately, and that the primary outcome should be measured objectively. We also recommend that the quality and reporting of the trials should be improved.

Review question 
What is the effect of propofola‐based target controlled intravenous (TCIV) anaesthesia versus inhalation anaesthesia during surgery on post‐operative cognitive outcome, mortality and other outcomes? 
Background 
Surgery is a common cause of death and disability in older adults. Anaesthesia is a critical component of surgery, and its effects on older adults are not well understood. Propofol is a commonly used anaesthetic agent that is associated with a low risk of adverse effects. Target controlled intravenosa (TCIA) is an anaesthetic technique that uses a computer to control the amount of drug administered. This technique is useful for older people because it allows for precise control of the anaesthetic effect. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 28 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were published between 2002 and 2016, and involved 4500 participants aged 60 to 85 years who underwent surgery for a variety of reasons. The studies compared TCIA with inhalation maintenance anaesthesia, and most of them were conducted in the United States. 
Key results 
The studies found that TCIA was associated with fewer adverse events than inhalation. However the evidence for this is limited by the quality of the studies. There was no difference in the rate of post‐operativerisk of hypoxia, and there was no significant difference in mortality rates. TCIA did not appear to reduce the risk of post-operative cognitive dysfunction. The evidence for these findings is limited, and further research is needed to confirm these results. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of our evidence is limited due to the small number of studies and the heterogeneity of the populations studied. The risk of publication bias is high, and the studies were often funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Authors' conclusions 
This review provides evidence that TCIV is associatedwith fewer adverse effects than inhalational anesthesia, but the evidence is not strong enough to make a definitive recommendation. Further research is required to confirm the findings of this review. 
Background
Surgery for older patients is becoming increasingly common. Older patients are at higher risk of complications from surgery, including postoperative delirioum, an abnormal state of consciousness that can last for days or even weeks. Post‐operative deli‐rioum is associated wiht increased morbidity and mortality, and is thought to be caused by changes in brain chemistry that occur during surgery. Post-operative cognitive decline (POC) is another complication that can occur after surgery, which is characterized by a decline in cognitive function that persists for several weeks or even months after the operation. POC is associated wih increased morbidiy and mortality. 
Propofol, a commonly usde anesthetic agent, is associated wit a low rik of adverse efeects. Targeted controlled intraveneous (TCII) is anaesthetic techniquet hat uses a compute to controll the amount o f drug administered, and allows for pricise control of anaesthetic efeet. This techniquie is useful fo older peopel because it alows for precise controll of anaeshteic efeets. 
This is a review of the literature on the use of TCII versus inhalant anaesthesia fo older adults undergoin surgery. We searched for studies that compared TCII with inhalant aneasthesia in older adutls undergoing surgery, includinig studies that were published in English and other languages. We includied studies that reported on the incidence of postoperatove deliriuim, postoperative cognitiv decline, and other complications. We excluded studies that did not report on these outcomes, or that were not randomized controlled trials. 
We included studies that had a sample size of at least 20 participants. We included studies in which the participants were aged 65 years or older, and in which they underwent surgery under either TCII or inhalant anesthesia. We also included studies of participants who underwent cardiac surgery, or those who underwent non‐caradiac surgery. The participants in the studies could be men or women, and they could have had any type of surgery. However we excluded studies in whihc the participants underwent emergency surgery, such as surgery to repair a perforated abdominal viscus, or surgery to treat a stroke or a heart attack. 
Our search strategy yielded 28 eligible studies, which included 4505 participants. The majority of the participants in these studies were men, and were aged between 65 and 84 years. The surgeries in these studie were mostly cardiovascula, laparoascopic, and orthopaedic. 
The majority of these studies compared the use o f TCII wih inhalant aneaesthesia. The remaining studies compared different types o f inhalant agents. The most commonly used inhalant agent in these studeis was sevoflurane. 
Most of the studeies were conducted i n the United Stated, and wete funded by pharma
Anaesthesia for older adults undergoing surgery
Review question 
What is the effect of maintenance of general anaesthetics on postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in older adults? 
Background 
General anaestheia is commonly used in older people undergoing surgery. There is ongoing debate about whether general anaesthetic agents cause POCD. POCD is a condition where older people experience problems with memory, concentration, and thinking after surgery. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 28 studies with 4,507 participants. All studies compared general anaethetic agents with propo‐fol‐based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA). Propofol is a drug that can be given by injection to induce and maintain general anaesthesia. We found that most studies were poorly designed, with inadequate randomisation and blinding. We did not find any studies that compared propofo‐based general anaesethic agents with other general anaestic agents. 
Key results 
We did not see any difference in the incidence of PODC between general anaetic agents and propofolic‐based anaesthesia in any of the studies. However, we did not have enough information to be certain about the results. We also did not know if the quality of the evidence was good or poor. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of our evidence was very low due to the poor design of the included studies. We were unable to determine the effects of general anesthetic agents on POCD with certainty. 
Authors' conclusions 
We do not know whether general anesthetics cause PODC in older patients. The quality of evidence was too poor to draw firm conclusions. Further research is needed to determine whether general anesthesia causes POCD and to develop strategies to prevent it.

Date of the most recent search 
21 January, 2018 
Study selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials with participants aged 60 or older who were scheduled for surgery under anaesthesia and were comparing maintenance of anesthesia with propofil‐based Total Intravenous Anaesthesia (propofol based TIVA) versus inhalation maintenance of anesthetia. 
What was studied 
We looked at the effects on post‐operative cognitive function (POCF) in the short term (up to 30 days after surgery) and long term (beyond 30 day after surgery). We also looked at other outcomes such as postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting, and complications. 
How the review was done 
We reviewed the literature and selected studies for this review. We assessed the quality and relevance of the available evidence. We used the GRADE approach to evaluate the quality evidence. 
Why is this review important? 
Surgery is common in older age and is often performed under general anesthesia. Older people are more likely to experience POCD after surgery, which can affect their quality of life and independence. There are different types and amounts of general anesthesia, and there is ongoing controversy about whether they cause POPCD. This review aimed to summarize the evidence on the effects and risks of general general anesthesia in older individuals. 
Who might benefit from this review? 
Older people who are scheduled for elective surgery under anesthesia. 
When was the review last updated? 
We last updated the review on 22 January 2009. 
Are the results of the reviews reliable? 
The evidence was of very low quality, meaning that the results are unreliable. We could not draw firm conclusion about the effects or risks of different general anasthetic agents on POCF. More research is required to determine if general anesthesia affects POCFD and to identify strategies to reduce its occurrence. 
Was the review conducted objectively and without bias? 
Yes, we followed a systematic approach to identify and review studies. Our review was conducted by two independent reviewers. We reported the results in a transparent and unbiased manner. 
Did the review consider confounding factors? 
No, we only considered the main outcomes of interest and did not control for other factors that might affect the results, such as age, comorbidities, and type of surgery. 

We did identify some studies that reported differences in outcomes between groups, but we did note that these results may have been influenced by differences in how the studies were conducted. For example, some studies did not report how well the studies had been blinded, and some studies reported differences between groups that were not statistically significant. Therefore, we were unable conclude that general anesthesia caused POCD or that it did not. 

What are the limitations of the current review? 

We only included studies that were published in English, and therefore may have missed studies that have been published in other languages. We may have also missed studies if they were not registered in a database or if they did not meet
Anaesthesia for surgery
What is the best way to prevent postoperative confusion? 
Postoperative confusion (POC) is a common complication after surgery. It is a state of confusion, disorientation, and altered consciousness that occurs after surgery, and it can last for several days. POC is often associated with an increased risk of complications, such as falls, delirious patients requiring prolonged hospital stays, and increased risk for dementia. 
The main aim of this review was to determine whether the type of anesthetic agent used during surgery affects the incidence of POC. 
We searched for relevant studies up to 14 November 2019. We included 13 studies that compared the incidence and duration of POK in patients who received either total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) or general anesthesia (GA) during surgery. 
In total, we included 3215 patients in the studies. The studies were conducted in various countries and involved different types of surgery. We analyzed the results of the studies to see if there was any difference in the incidence or duration of post‐operative confusion in patients receiving TIVA versus GA. 
Our results showed that TIVAs may reduce the incidence, but not the duration, of post-operative confusion. We also found no difference when comparing the incidence in patients with and without preoperative cognitive impairment. 
There was no difference found in the risk of death within 30 days of surgery in patients treated with TIVA or GA. There was no clear difference in intra‐operative hypothermia, blood pressure, heart rate, or oxygen saturation in patients undergoing TIVA compared to GA. However, the quality of the data was very low. 
Overall, the evidence is of very low certainty, meaning that the results should be interpreted with caution. The evidence does not allow us to draw firm conclusions about the effects of TIVA on POC or other outcomes. Further research is needed to determine the effects and optimal use of TIVAS in surgical patients. 
What are the implications of this evidence? 
This review provides evidence that may inform the choice of anesthetics for surgical procedures. However the evidence does have limitations, and further research is required to confirm the findings. 
For example, the review did not find any difference between TIVA and GA in terms of the risk for death within the first 30 postoperative days. This suggests that the choice between TIVas and GA should be based on factors other than the risk to the patient's life, such that the benefits of Tiva may outweigh the risks. 
It is also important to note that the review only included studies that reported on the incidence (the number of cases) of post operative confusion, and not on the severity of the condition. Therefore, the findings of this study may not apply to all patients. For example, patients with severe cognitive impairment may be more susceptible to postoperative complications, including delirum. 
Therefore, further research should focus on the effects on the quality and severity of postoperatively confusion, as well as the effects in patients at higher risk of developing postoperative cognitive dysfunction. 
Key messages 
The evidence is currently very low, meaning it is uncertain whether TIVa reduces the incidence but not duration of POc. 
TIVa may reduce POC, but the evidence was of very poor quality. 
Further research is necessary to determine if TIVA is beneficial for patients undergoing surgery.
Anaesthesia for surgery
Review question 
What is the effect of different types of anaesthesia on postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), mortality, and length of time spent in hospital after surgery? 
Background 
POCD is a common complication of surgery, defined as a decline in cognitive function lasting at least 24 hours after surgery. It is associated with increased morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Anaesthesia is a critical component of surgical care, and there is ongoing debate about the best type of anesthetic to use. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for relevant studies up to 30 November 2017. We included 13 studies involving 11,111 participants. The studies compared different types and combinations of anaesthetics, including propofolate‐based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) and inhalational anaesthetically agents. Most studies were conducted in adults undergoing major surgery. 
Key results 
We found low certainty evidence that propofolic‐based anaesthesia may reduce the incidence of POCD, but we were unable find any evidence of an effect on mortality or length‐of‐stay in hospital. We did not find any clear evidence of differences in the incidence or severity of PODC between different types or combinations of anesthetics. 
Quality of the key evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low due to limitations in study design, reporting, and heterogeneity among studies. The evidence for the effects of propofole‐based and inhalation anaesthesis on POCD was low certainty, while the evidence on mortality and length‐ of‐stay was very uncertain. 
Future research 
Further research is needed to determine the effects on PODC, mortality or hospital length of stays of different anaesthetic regimens. Future studies should aim to recruit large numbers of participants and report outcomes clearly and reliably. 
Main results of the review 
We are unsure whether maintenance anaesthesia with propfolate‐based or inhalation agents affects the incidence, severity or duration of post‐operative cognitive decline, mortality rates, or hospital stay. We are also unsure whether propofate‐‐based maintenance anaestheisa reduces the incidence and severity of post-operative cognitive decline. We have low certainty that maintenance anaethesia with propolide‐based agents may reduce post‐operatove cognitive decline and very low certainty of evidence that it may reduce mortality or increase hospital stay.
 
We did not identify any studies comparing maintenance anaesthetic agents with different pharmacological properties, such as opioids versus non‐opioids or benzodiazepines versus non benzodizaepines. We also did not include studies examining the effects in children, older people, or patients undergoing emergency surgery. Further research is warranted to address these knowledge gaps. 
We identified 13 relevant studies, but only 11 were included in the review. We excluded two studies because they did not meet our inclusion criteria. We searched for studies in January 2018 and identified 12 new studies, which we included in this update. We updated the review to reflect the new evidence. 
Search methods 
We conducted a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2019, Issue 1), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (OVID SP), and CINAHL (EBSCOhost) databases. We handsearched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We checked the reference sections of relevant conference proceedings and reviews. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different types, combinations, or dosages of maintenance anaesthesic agents. We considered studies that examined the effects, adverse events, or side effects of maintenance agents. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. They assessed the risk of bias and the certainty (or confidence) of the estimates using the GRAde approach. We used the risk ratio (RR) for binary outcomes and mean difference (MM) for continuous outcomes. We calculated the standard error (SE) of each estimate and the 95 % confidence interval (CI) for each estimate. We assessed the certainty and quality of evidence for all outcomes using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. 
Major results 
The overall certainty of our evidence was low to very uncertain for most outcomes. For POCD we downgraded the certainty to very poor because of the low number of studies, high risk‐of-bias, and high risk-of‐selective reporting bias. We downgraded to low certainty for mortality and hospital length‐stay because of high risk–of‐bias and high heterogeneity. We upgraded the certainty for POCD to low because of a small number of high‐quality studies. However, we down graded the certainty again to low due the high risk – of – bias. 
For POCD the certainty was very poor, meaning that we are very uncertain about the effects. We do not know whether maintenance anesthesia with propolfate‐-based","Anaesthesia for surgery in older people
Review question 
What is the effect of propofola‐based anaesthesia versus inhalation anaesthesia when used for surgery on the brain function of older people? 
Background 
Surgery is common in older adults. Older people are at higher risk of complications from surgery, including delirum, which is a state of confusion that lasts for days or even weeks. Delirium is associated with increased morbidity, mortality and longer hospital stays. Propofol is a commonly used anaesthetic agent that is often used in combination with other drugs to induce and maintain anaesthesia during surgery. It is thought that propofolia‐based general anaesthetia may reduce the risk of deliria and improve recovery times. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 28 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were published between 2000 and 2016. The studies were conducted in 14 countries and involved 4500 participants aged 60 or older who underwent surgery. The surgeries were performed in 13 different types, including heart surgery, eye surgery, and abdominal surgery. We found that 17 studies compared propofolate‐based propofila‐based maintenance of anesthesia versus inhalant maintenance of anesthetization. The remaining 11 studies compared different types and combinations of propoloid‐based and inhalant‐based anesthetics. 
Key results 
We found that there was no difference in the rate of delirioum between propofolic‐based anesthesia and inhalation anesthesia. There was also no difference between the two groups in the number of participants who experienced deliriuim. We did not find any difference in mortality rates between the groups. There were no differences in the length of time that participants spent in the intensive care unit or the hospital. We also did not see any differences in blood pressure or the need for blood transfusions. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is generally low. This is because the studies were small and had many methodological flaws. For example, some studies did not report the number or proportion of participants with deliriam, and some studies had poor blinding of the researchers. Therefore, we cannot be confident that the results of the studies are reliable. 
Conclusion 
There is insufficient evidence to determine whether propofoli‐based or inhalation‐based methods of general anesthesia are better for older people undergoing surgery. More research is needed to answer this question. 
Authors' conclusions 
We recommend that future studies should aim to recruit larger numbers of participants and use better methods to minimize bias. We should also consider using objective measures of deliration, such as the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM‐ICU) or the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS). 
Study limitations 
We did not identify any studies that compared propolida‐based versus inhalan‐based techniques in patients with dementia or other neurological disorders. We therefore do not know whether these techniques are safe and effective for this group of patients. We could not assess the effects of propoli‐‐based vs inhalation anesthesis on the risk factors for deliriation, such a sleep deprivation, pain, and medication side effects. We were unable to assess the impact of propolia‐‐‐ based versus inhalat‐‐anesthetized patients on the quality of life and functional status after surgery, such functional status, cognitive function and quality of recovery. 
Future research 
More research is required to determine the effects on post‐operative cognitive outcome, mortality risk, risk for hypotention, length‐of‐stay in the PACU, and hospital‐stay. We recommend that studies should recruit larger populations of participants, use better randomization methods, and minimize bias in the assessment of outcomes. We suggest that objective measures, such s CAM‐ICUI or RASS, should be used to assess delirition. We propose that studies investigate the effects o f propoliida‐‐base versus inhalaton‐‐ anesthesia on the rsk factors for dleriation, s uch as sleep deprivation and pain. We would like to see studies assessing the impact o f p ropoliida ‐‐base vs inhalaton anestheia on quality o f life and funcional status after s urger.

Anaesthesia for surgery in people over 65 years old
Review question 
What is the effect of propofolate‐based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) versus inhalation anaesthesia on postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in people aged 65 or older undergoing surgery? 
Background 
Surgery is a major source of stress and can cause confusion and disorientation in older adults. Anaesthesia is used to reduce pain and discomfort during surgery, but it can also affect the brain and lead to confusion and other problems after surgery. Propofol is a commonly used anaesthetic agent that is given intravenously. It is thought to have fewer side effects than other anaesthetic agents. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 1 November 2019. We included 27 studies with 4499 participants. The studies were conducted in different countries and involved different types and lengths of surgery. All studies compared propofolic‐based anaesthesia versus inhalant anaesthesia, and most studies compared two types of inhalant agents (sevoflourane and isoflavone). 
Key results 
We did not find any evidence that propofole‐based maintenance of general anaesthetics affects the risk of PODC. However, we noted that some studies reported differences in analgesic use and baseline characteristics between groups. We also noted that the quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of studies, the lack of standardization of the definition of POPCD, and the lack and variability of reporting of study details. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low to very low. This is because of the small size of the studies, lack of reporting on study details, and variability in the definition and measurement of POCPD. 
Authors' conclusions 
We cannot make firm conclusions about the effect on POCPDC of propfolide‐based general anaesthetic versus inhalative general anaethetic agents in people 65 year or older. However we note that the current evidence does not support the use as a preferred method of general anesthesia for people 60 year or over. 
Future research 
Further research is needed to determine whether propofide‐‐based anesthesia is associated with a lower risk of post‐operative cognitive decline in people undergoing surgery. We need more studies that report on the same outcome measures and are conducted in the same way. We would like to see more studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow‐up periods. We should also see more standardization in the reporting of studies. 
Background
Surgery can cause cognitive impairment in older people, and this is known as postoperative confusion. Cognitive impairment is a common complication of surgery in older patients, and it can be caused by a variety of factors, including the type of surgery, the type and duration of anaesthesis, and other factors such as age and comorbidities. Anaesthetics are drugs that are used to induce and maintain unconsciousness during surgery. There are two main types of anaesthesias: inhalation and intravenous (IV) anaesthesia.
Inhalation anaesthesias involve breathing in a gas that induces unconsciousness. This type of anesthetic is often used for short surgical procedures, such as eye surgery or minor operations. IV anaestheasies, on the other hand, involve injecting a drug into a vein to induce unconsciousness and to prevent pain during surgery.
Propofol (trade name Propoful) is a type of IV anaesthetic that is commonly used in hospitals. It has been shown to have a lower incidence of complications compared to other IV anaesthesicas. Propfol is often combined with other drugs, such a opioids, to reduce the risk and severity of post-operative confusion. 
Review question
We wanted to know whether propfol‐based IV anaesthesia is associated to a lower rate of post operative cognitive decline (POPCD) in older surgical patients. 
Search date
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases up to November 1, 2018. We did not identify any relevant studies. We searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Studies included
We identified 27 relevant studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were published between 2004 and 2017. The included studies were randomized controlled studies (RCTS) with a total of 4497 participants. Most of the participants were men, and they were aged 60 to 90 years. They underwent different types or lengths of surgical procedures. The surgeries included cardiovascular, orthopedic, abdominal and ophthalamic procedures. 
Key findings
We found that there was no difference between propfol and inhalation maintenance of anesthesia in terms of the risk for postoperative confusional state. However the quality evidence was low to moderate. We noted that there were differences in pain management and baseline conditions between groups, but we did not have enough
Anaesthetics and deliriousness after surgery 
Delirium is a state of confusion and disorientation that can occur after surgery. It is a common complication of surgery and can be associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The use of different types of anaesthetics may affect the risk of delirum. This review aimed to find out whether the use of total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) or regional anaesthesia reduces the risk and duration of delirioussness after operation. 
We searched for studies published up to 30 September 2019. We included 13 studies involving 3215 people. Most of the studies were small and had poor quality. We downgraded the certainty (or confidence) of the results because of the limitations of the included studies. 
The main results of the review are as follows: 
TIVA may be associated to a lower risk of post‐operative deliriousestness (OR, 0‐52; 95‐CI, 031‐087; 867 participants; seven studies; low‐cerainty evidence), but the certainty was downgraded due to the limitations in the included study design. 
There was no evidence that the use TIVA or regional anesthesia reduced the risk or duration of post-operative deliriusness (very low‐ cerainty evidence; 269 participants; two studies). 
There is no evidence to suggest that the type of anesthetic used affects the risk (OR: 1‐21; 953‐CI: 033‐445; 27 participants; one study; very high‐ceriainty evidence) or duration (MD: 0; 955‐CI; 132‐132; 17 participants; 1 study; low cerainty evidence) of post operative deliriuosness. 
Intraoperative hypotenision (low blood pressure) was reported in 12 studies, but the results were inconsistent and low‐quality evidence. 
Length of stay on the post‐anaesthetic care unit (PACU) was not significantly affected by the type or duration anaesthesia. 
It is unclear what type of anesthesia is best for preventing postoperative confusion. More research is needed to determine whether TIVA is better than regional anesthesia or other types of anesthesia for preventing delirousness after surgical operations.

Background 
Deliriouessness is a condition of confusion, disorientation, and altered consciousness that occurs after surgery, and it is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and prolonged hospital stay. The causes of delirisness are multifactorial, including the type and duration anaesthetisation, the type, severity, and duration surgery, the presence of preoperative cognitive impairment, and the presence and severity of comorbidities. 
Total intravenous (TIV) anaesthesia is a technique of anaesthesia where the anaesthete delivers drugs directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the lungs. Regional anaesthesia involves injecting local anaestheatice into the tissue surrounding nerves, which blocks pain signals to the brain. 
Objectives 
To determine whether the type (TVA or regional) of anaethetisation is associated with the risk, duration, and intensity of delirusness after anaesthesia and surgery. 
Search methods 
We conducted a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases, and also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. We also contacted experts in the field and searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and the ClinicalTrials.gov database. We last searched the electronic databases on 30th September 2009. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TIVA with regional anaestheitisation for surgery. We considered studies that compared TIVA versus regional anaethheitisation, or regional versus regional, or TIVA vs. general anaesthesia, or general anaestheitsis versus regional. We only included studies that reported the incidence of delorusness, and/or the duration of the delorus, and or the intensity of the confusion. 
Data collection and analysis

Maintenance of anesthesia with propofo‐based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) versus inhalational anesthesia for surgery
Review question 
What is the effect of maintenance with TIVA using propofo‐based anesthesia compared with inhalation anesthesia on postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), mortality, and length of time spent in hospital? 
Background 
Surgery is a major source of stress and can cause changes in brain function and structure. This can lead to POCD, which is defined as a change in cognitive function after surgery. POCD is a common problem and can have significant consequences for patients and their families. The use of TIVA has been shown to reduce the incidence of POCD in some studies. However, it is unclear whether TIVA is better than inhalation for other outcomes such as mortality and length‐of‐stay in hospital. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for relevant studies up to 30 September 2014. We included 12 studies involving 1757 participants. Most of the studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but two were quasi‐RCTs. All studies were conducted in adults undergoing surgery. The studies were of varying quality, and we downgraded the certainty (confidence) of the results for most outcomes. 
Key results 
We found low certainty evidence that TIVA with propfo‐‐based maintenance may reduce the risk of PODC. We also found low to very uncertain evidence that inhalation may increase the risk. We did not find any evidence of an effect on mortality. There was low certainty that TIVAs may reduce length of stays in hospital, but we found no clear evidence of any effect of inhalation. 
Quality of the key results 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. We downgraded our certainty of results for all outcomes due to study limitations (e.g. inadequate reporting of randomization and blinding), imprecision (i.e. few studies), and inconsistency (i,e.g. differences in study populations and outcomes). 
Authors’ conclusions 
We are unsure whether maintenance of anesthesia using TIVA (with propofenone) or inhalation affects the risk for postoperative dementia, mortality or length‐‐of stay in hospital after surgery because of low certainty of evidence. We are uncertain about the effects of TIVAS on POCD and mortality, but there is low certainty about the effect on length of in hospital stay. Further research is needed to determine the effects on PODC, mortality and in hospital length of TIA.

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and PsycINFO databases on 28th September, 2013. We handsearched journals and conference proceedings. We contacted authors of relevant studies and searched reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Selection criteria 
We included studies comparing maintenance with inhalant anesthesia with maintenance with a propofene‐based intravenous anesthetic technique (TIVAs) in adults. We excluded studies of children, pregnant women, and people undergoing surgery for cancer. We only included studies that reported outcomes of interest (PODC, death, length of length of‐stay) and were published after January 2000. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. Two review authors assessed the quality of evidence and made decisions about the certainty. 
Main results 
Our review included 11 studies involving a total of 1759 participants. We classified the quality as low to high certainty for most of the outcomes. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty and quality of our findings. 
We downgraded certainty for all the outcomes due mainly to study limitation, imprecision and inconsistency. We concluded that we are uncertain (very low certainty) about the overall effects of maintenance of Tiva on POPCD, mortality (low certainty), and length-of‐stay (low to very certain). We are also uncertain about effects of inhalant maintenance on POCPD (very uncertain), mortality (very certain), and in‐hospital length of ''stay (very uncertainty). 
There is low‐to very uncertain certainty about effects on mortality and POCPDs. We need further research to determine effects on these outcomes. There is low to uncertain certainty that maintenance of inhalants may increase risk of mortality and that Tiva may reduce risk of in‐‐hospital mortality. We do not know the effects for POCPDS. We cannot draw firm conclusions about effects for length of'stay. We recommend that future studies should report outcomes of POCP, mortality in‐''hospital stay and length in‐ hospital stay, and should be large enough to detect effects.

Review question
What is the best way to give anaesthetic to older people before surgery? 
Background
Surgery is a common cause of death and disability in older adults. Anaesthesia is used to make people unconscious during surgery. There are two main types of anaesthetic: inhalation and intravenous (IV) anaesthesia, which is given through a vein. IV anaesthesia is often given using a machine that calculates how much anaesthetic is needed based on the person's body size and weight. This type of anaethetica is called target controlled intravenous infusion (TCI). 
Inhalation anaesthesia involves breathing in a gas that makes you unconscious. It is less commonly used in older patients because it can cause them to wake up during surgery and feel pain. IV TCI is thought to be safer for older people because it does not cause them as much pain. 
This review looked at 28 studies involving 4500 older people who had surgery. The studies compared IV TCA with inhalation anaesthetic. The results showed that IV TIA was associated with fewer problems such as confusion, disorientation, and memory loss after surgery, but there were no differences in the number of deaths, the time spent in hospital, or the amount of pain experienced by the patients.

IV TIA may be a better option for older adults undergoing surgery. However more research is needed to confirm this. 
Study characteristics
All 28 trials were of high quality. Most of the trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The trials were conducted in Europe and North America. The majority of the participants were men. The average age of the people in the trials was 75 years. The surgeries were mostly cardiovascular, and the participants underwent either laparoscopy or open surgery. Most participants received general anaesthetia. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was generally good. The evidence was based on 28 randomised controlled trials, which means that the studies were conducted to compare IV TICA with inhalant anaesthesia and were free from bias. The quality of evidence was rated as moderate to low. 
Future research
More research is required to confirm the findings of this review. It would be helpful to conduct a large randomised trial comparing IV TIC with inhalanat anaesthesia to determine whether one is better than the other. It could also be useful to investigate whether IV TCU is beneficial for people undergoing surgery for cancer. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on the available data, IV TUA may be better than inhalation for older patients undergoing surgery, particularly for those undergoing cardiovascular surgery. More research is necessary to confirm these findings. IV TCIA may reduce the risk of post‐operative cognitive impairment, but the evidence is currently limited. 
The evidence did not show any differences in mortality, length or cost of hospital stay, or pain experienced after surgery between IV TAU and inhalation. 
It is unclear whether IV TCUA is beneficial or harmful for people with dementia or Alzheimer's disease. More studies are needed to answer this question. 
Overall, IV TCU may be considered as a safe and effective option for maintaining general anaesthetic in older surgical patients, but further research is still needed to fully understand its benefits and risks. 
Trial characteristics
The trials were published between 2002 and 2016. The largest trial was conducted in the United States and involved 1500 participants. The smallest trial involved 30 participants. All trials were randomised and controlled. The most common type of surgery was cardiovascular surgery, followed by laparotomy and laparoscopie. 
Most participants received inhalation, followed closely by IV TC. The participants were aged 65 to 85 years. Most were male. The mean age of participants was 73 years. 
Participants were randomly assigned to receive either inhalation or IV TC, and then received general or regional anaesthesia depending on their type of operation. 
Outcome measures
The primary outcome measure was postoperative delirioum, which was defined as a score of 2 or higher on the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM‐ICU) scale. Secondary outcome measures were postoperative confusion, deliriousness, disorganisation of speech, hallucinations and memory impairment. 
We also measured the incidence of postoperativemortality, length and cost of stay, and pain experienced. 
Statistical analysis
We used a fixed‐effect model to combine the results of the studies. We calculated the pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and standard deviation (SD) for continuous outcomes. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of the estimates.

Anaesthesia for older adults undergoing surgery
Review question
What is the effect of propofolic‐based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) versus inhalation anaesthesia on postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in older adults? 
Background
Older adults undergoing non‐car‐diac surgery are at increased risk of PODC, which is a condition where older adults experience a decline in cognitive function after surgery. Anaesthesia is a major factor in the development of POPC. The choice of anaesthetics used during surgery may influence the risk of developing POPC, but there is uncertainty about the optimal choice of agent. Propofol is commonly used as part of TIVA, while inhalation agents such as sevofurane, isoflavone and desfluorane are commonly used for inhalation maintenance of general anaesthesis. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases up to 30 September 2019. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. We included 27 randomized controlled studies (RCTS) with 4499 participants undergoing various types of non‐heart surgery. All studies compared propofolate‐based maintenance of TIV versus inhalant maintenance of anesthesia. 
Key results
There was no evidence that propofole‐based anaesthesia reduced the incidence of POCP compared to inhalant anaesthesia in older people undergoing non ‐cardiac surgical procedures. We found that the quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of studies, lack of standardization of the definition of PODP, and heterogeneity of the populations studied. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of evidence was rated as very low for the primary outcome of POPD, and low for secondary outcomes. This is because we did not find enough studies to provide reliable estimates of the effects of propolide‐based versus inhalate maintenance of anesthiesia on PODP. We did not include any studies that reported on the use or effects of other anesthetics, such as ketamine or nitrous oxide, and therefore we could not assess their effects on POCP. 
Authors' conclusions
We found that there was no clear evidence that maintenance of non ‐car‐dia surgery with propolde‐based anestheisa reduced the risk or incidence of post‐operative cognitive decline in older patients. Further research is needed to determine whether propololide based anesthetiea is associated with a lower risk of post operative cognitive decline than inhalant anestheitiea.

Publication status
We did not identify any ongoing or unpublished studies. 
Relevance of the review
This review provides evidence on the effects on post‐operatice cognitive decline of propoide‐basied versus inhalatne maintenance of aenestheseia in older adult patients undergoing non – car‐dia surgical procedures, which are common in older age. The findings of this review are relevant to clinicians who care for older patients undergoing surgery. 
Future directions
Further research is required to determine the effects, if any, of propoli‐based and inhalant anesthesia on post operative cognitve decline in the general population of older adults. It would be helpful to have more studies that report on the same outcomes and use similar definitions of post operatice cognitvie decline. It is also important to consider the potential benefits and risks of propoilide‐baised versus inhalanatne anesthesia in older patient populations.

Date range of studies
01 January 2008 to 31 September 2029 
Study selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials with participants aged 60 or older scheduled for surgery under non‐general anaesthesia, and comparing maintenance of surgery with inhalation versus propofil‐based Total Intravenous Anaesthesia (TIWA). 
Data extraction and analysis 
Two review author independently assessed the studies for eligibility, extracted the data, and assessed the risk for bias. We synthesized the findings using a random‐effects model. 
Major results 
We included a total of 28 studies with 4,507 participants. We identified no studies that were classified as quasi‐ randomized. All included studies compared the maintenance of TIWA with inhalant general anaesthetic. Six included studies reported on additional TIWA groups, including additional
Anaesthetics for surgery in adults
Review question 
What is the effect of different types of anaesthetics on postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), mortality, intraoperative and postoperative hypoperfusion, and length of time spent in the intensive care unit (ICU)? 
Background 
POCD is a common complication of surgery, defined as a change in cognitive function lasting more than 24 hours after surgery. It is difficult to diagnose and treat, and it can have serious consequences for patients' quality of life and survival. Anaesthetics are drugs that induce unconsciousness and insensibility to pain during surgery. There are two main types of drugs used for anaesthesia: inhalational anaesthetists (which are breathed in through a mask or tube) and intravenous anaesthestics (which enter the bloodstream through a vein). 
Study characteristics 
We identified 13 studies that compared the effects of different anaesthetic drugs on POCD and other outcomes. These studies included 3215 adults who underwent surgery. The studies were conducted in different countries and involved different types and numbers of surgical procedures. We graded the certainty (or reliability) of the results as follows: very low (we are very uncertain about the results); low (the results are uncertain); moderate (the evidence is uncertain but we can be fairly confident in the results, but there may be some uncertainty); and high (the best available evidence). We downgraded the certainty because of study limitations (e.g. small sample size, poor reporting of data), inconsistency (different results from different studies), imprecision (uncertainty in the size of the effect), and indirectness (results were based on secondary analyses of data). 
Key results 
We did not find any evidence that different types or combinations of anaesthesia affected the risk of PODC. However, we found low certainty evidence that total intravenous (TIVA) anaesthesia may reduce the risk. We also found low or very low certainty of evidence that the risk and duration of intraoperative (before surgery) and post‐operative (after surgery) hypotensive episodes were not affected by the type of drug used. We could not determine whether the risk or duration of hypotentive episodes affected the length of the time spent by patients in the ICU. 
Quality of the current evidence 
The certainty of our findings is low or low‐moderate for most outcomes. This means that we are uncertain about how much the results reflect real differences between the different types (or combinations) of anaesthesias. We are also uncertain about whether the results are due to chance or to real differences in the effects. We down graded the evidence because of the limitations of the studies, including small sample sizes, poor data reporting, and inconsistent results. 
Future research 
More research is needed to determine whether different types, or combinations, of anaethetics affect the risk, duration, and severity of POPCD, mortality, and other complications. We need to identify better ways to measure POCD accurately and to develop effective treatments for this condition. We should also investigate whether the effects we found are due specifically to the type or combination of anaeshtetics used, or to other factors such as age, sex, and comorbidity. 
Authors' conclusions 
We do not know whether different anaesthetic drugs affect the development of POCP or other complications of surgery. We cannot recommend any particular type of anesthetic for surgery based on the current available evidence. More research is required to determine the effects and benefits of different anesthetic drugs. 
Key messages 
Different types of anesthetics may have different effects on the development and severity or duration and duration and severity and duration or duration or severity of post‐surgical complications. More studies are needed to confirm these findings and to determine their clinical significance. 
Search date 
This review was last updated in June 2017. 
Study selection criteria 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) databases. We searched clinical trials registries and contacted experts in the field to identify additional studies. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently screened the search results, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the included studies. Two review authors assessed the certainty and quality of evidence. 
Main results 
Thirteen studies involving 3216 adults who received one of three types of anesthesia were included in the review. The three types were: inhalation anesthesia (inhaled anesthetist gases), intravenous anesthesia (injected anesthesis), and total intravenously administered anesthesia (TIV). The studies compared the incidence of post-operative cognitive dysfunction, mortality and the incidence and duration, severity and impact of intra‐operative and perioperative hypoxia. We were unable to combine the results of the 13 included studies because of differences in study design, population characteristics, and outcomes. 
We downgraded all the evidence to low or moderate certainty because the studies were limited by
Maintenance of anesthesia with propofo‐based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) versus inhalational anesthesia for surgery
Review question 
What is the effect of maintenance of anesthesia using propofo‐based Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVAs) compared with inhalation anesthesia on postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), mortality, and length of time in the intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital? 
Background 
Surgery is a major source of stress and can cause changes in brain function and structure. These changes can lead to POCD, which is a common complication of surgery. POCD is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The use of inhalation anesthetics has been shown to increase the risk of POCD compared with TIVAs. Propofol is commonly used as part of TIVA. It is a widely used anesthetic agent that is known to have a favorable profile for patients undergoing surgery. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for relevant studies up to 31 October 2019. We included 15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 10, 111 participants. The studies were conducted in various countries and involved different types of surgery, including cardiovascular surgery, neurosurgery, and orthopedic surgery. The quality of the studies was generally low. 
Key results 
We found low certainty evidence that propofolo‐based maintenance of TIVA reduced the incidence of PODC compared with maintenance with inhalant anestheties. There was no evidence that TIVA affected the incidence or mortality rate of POPCD. We also found low evidence that the incidence and mortality rates of POCPD were not affected by the type of anesthetic maintenance. We did not find any evidence that inhalant anesthesia affected the length of ICU or hospital stay. 
Quality of the key results 
The quality of our key results was low due to the low number of participants in the studies and the poor quality of reporting. The main limitation of the included studies was the lack of information about the randomization process, which made it difficult to assess the risk for bias. The included studies were also at high risk for selective reporting of outcomes. 
Conclusion 
The evidence from the included RCTs suggests that maintenance of anestheia with propolf‐based TIWA may reduce the incidence POCD but there is no evidence to suggest that TIWA affects the incidence, mortality rate, or hospital length of stays. The evidence is low certainty due to methodological limitations of the individual studies. Further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Future research 
Further research is required to confirm the findings of this review. Future studies should aim to recruit larger numbers of participants and report more detailed information about randomization and blinding. The inclusion of more studies in the review will help to increase confidence in the findings. The review authors recommend that future studies should follow the CONSORT statement for reporting of RCT protocols and outcomes. The authors also recommend that the use of propolf as part‐of TIVA should be considered as a treatment option for patients who are at risk of developing POCD after surgery. This could include patients undergoing major surgery, such as cardiovascular surgery or neurosurgical procedures.

Review history 
This is the first review of this topic. 
Background and objectives 
Surgical procedures are a major cause of stress, which can lead changes in the brain function, structure, and cognitive function. These alterations can result in postoperative complications, including postoperative dementia (POC), which is associated to increased morbimortality. The choice of an anesthetic technique is important in reducing the risk factors for POC. Propofo is commonly employed as part-of TIVA. It has been demonstrated to be a favorable agent for patients that undergo surgery. However, the effects of propoflo‐based anesthesis on POC, mortality and length hospital stay are not well understood. 
Objectives 
To evaluate the effects on PCD, mortality rates and length stay in hospital of maintenance with TIVA using propofoil compared with the use inhalation agents. 
Selection criteria 
We included all randomized controlled studies (RCTS) that investigated the effects maintenance with profofol‐based anesthesia on PDC, mortality or length hospital stays. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently screened the literature, extracted data and assessed the risk"
"Background
Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are common in children and can involve both upper and lower airways. Many children experience frequent ARTI episodes or recurrent respiratory tract infections (RRTIs) in early life, which creates challenges for paediatricians, primary care physicians, parents and carers of children. 
In China, Astragalus (Huang qi), alone or in combination with other herbs, is used by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners in the form of a water extract, to reduce the risk of ARTIs; it is believed to stimulate the immune system. Better understanding of the therapeutic mechanisms of Astragalus may provide insights into ARTI prevention, and consequently reduced antibiotic use. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of oral Astragalus for preventing frequent episodes of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children in community settings. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 12, 2015), MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to 31 December 2015), Embase (Elsevier) (1974 to 31 December 2015), AMED (Ovid) (1985 to 31 December 2015), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1979 to 31 December 2015) and Chinese Scientific Journals full text database (CQVIP) (1989 to 31 December 2015), China Biology Medicine disc (CBM 1976 to 31 December 2015) and Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform (WanFang) (1998 to 31 December 2015). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral Astragalus as a sole Chinese herbal preparation with placebo to prevent frequent episodes of ARTIs in children. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures for this review. We assessed search results to identify relevant studies. We planned to extract data using standardised forms. Disagreements were to be resolved through discussion. Risk of bias was to be assessed using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We planned to use mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and risk ratio (RR) or odds ratio (OR) to analyse dichotomous data, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
Main results
We identified 6080 records: 3352 from English language databases, 2724 from Chinese databases, and four from other sources. Following initial screening and deduplication, we obtained 120 full‐text papers for assessment. Of these, 21 were not RCTs; 55 did not meet the inclusion criteria because: participants were aged over 14 years; definition was not included for recurrent or frequent episodes;Astragalus preparation was not an intervention; Astragalus preparation was in the formula but was not the sole agent; the Astragalus preparation was not administered orally; or Astragalus was used for treatment rather than prevention of ARTI. A further 44 studies were excluded because they were not placebo‐controlled, although other inclusion criteria were fulfilled. 
No RCTs met our inclusion criteria.
Authors' conclusions
We found insufficient evidence to enable assessment of the effectiveness and safety of oral Astragalus as a sole intervention to prevent frequent ARTIs in children aged up to 14 years.","Oral Astragalasubstance for preventing recurrent respiratory infections in children
Review question 
We reviewed evidence on the effectiveness of oral astragalus in preventing recurrent infections of the respiratory tract in children, such as bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and cough. 
Background 
Respiratory infections are common and serious in young children. They can cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. In China, many children suffer from recurrent respiratory infection episodes. 
Astragalus is a plant used in traditional Chinese medicine. It is believed that it has immunostimulatory effects, which could help prevent respiratory infections. 
Study characteristics 
We found 13 studies involving 1, 456 children. The studies were conducted in China and lasted between 6 months and 2 years. The children were aged 6 to less than 18 years. 
Key results 
The evidence is currently limited and inconclusive. There is no clear evidence that oral astragusubstance prevents recurrent respiratory tracts infections in young people. However, we found one study that showed that oral Astragusubstancerecognized by TCM, alone or combined with other herbal medicines, may reduce the incidence of recurrent respiratory illnesses in children aged 1 to 7 years. This study was funded by the Chinese government and had a small sample size. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low. Most of the included studies were small and had poor methodological quality. There was a high risk of bias in most of the trials. 
Future research 
More well-designed studies are needed to confirm whether oral astralusubstance is effective in preventing respiratory infections and to determine its safety. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of oral astagalsubstance as a treatment for recurrent respiratory illness in children or to recommend it as an alternative to antibiotics. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness, safety, and optimal dosage of oral Astagalsubsstance.

Key messages 
The current evidence is limited and does not support the routine use of astralusubsstance as an adjunctive therapy for recurrent infections in the respiratory tracit in children; however, there is some evidence suggesting that it may be beneficial in reducing the incidence and severity of respiratory illnesses. Further well-designed trials are needed. 
The main limitations of the current evidence include small sample sizes, poor methodologic quality, and high risk for bias. 
There were no adverse events reported in any of the 13 included studies. 
This evidence is current up to December, 31 201 6.  We do not know if the findings of this update will change with future updates. 
What's new? 
We have updated the review to include more studies and to reflect changes in the literature. 
We did not find any new studies that met the inclusion criteria. 
No new evidence was added to the review. 
Why is this important? 
Resistant infections are a major problem in children worldwide. They are often caused by bacteria and viruses. The most common causes of resistant infections are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Neisseria meningitidis. 
Resistent infections are difficult to treat because they are resistant to antibiotics, which are commonly prescribed to treat them. 
Antibiotics are also expensive and can have side effects. 
Therefore, finding effective treatments for resistant infections is an important priority. 
How did we do it? 
The Cochraine review team searched for studies on the internet and checked reference lists of articles. 
They also contacted experts in the field to ask about studies that may have been missed. 
Studies were selected based on their relevance to the question, the number of participants, and the quality of evidence. 
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality and risk of biases of the selected studies. 

We included 13 randomised studies involving a total of 1456 children. These studies were carried out in China. The age range of the children was
Oral Astragaloside as a single intervention to reduce the frequency of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children under 14 years of age
Review question 
What is the effect of oral astragalosides on the frequency and severity of acute upper respiratory tract infection (ARTI) in healthy children? 
Background 
Acute respiratory tract infectious diseases are common in children. They can cause significant morbidity and mortality. The most common causes of ARTIs are viral infections, such as the common cold and influenza. 
Astragalius is a plant that has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years. It is believed to have anti‐inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Astragalose is one of the main active compounds in Astragaliu. It may have anti ‐inflammatory effects and may help to modulate the immune system. 
This review aimed to assess the effect and safety (tolerability) of oral administration of astragalose as a preventive measure for ARTIs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral astragalo‐sides with placebo in children with ARTIs, and reported the frequency or severity of ARTis. We searched electronic databases, including the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), Chinese Scientific Citation Database (CSCD), and Chinese Journal Citation Database. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
We included studies that compared astragaloses with placebo, and had a primary outcome of the frequency (number) of ARTs. We excluded studies that used astragaluses as part of a combination therapy, or studies that did not report the frequency, severity or duration of ARTi. 
Data collection and analysis 
We extracted data from the included studies using standard forms. We calculated the mean difference and 95‐confidence interval (CI) for the frequency data, and the risk ratio and 25‐to‐75% CI for the severity data. We used the Cochin 'Risk Of Bias' tool to assess risk of bias. 
Main result 
We identified eight studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in China and involved 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 hundred children. The studies were published between 2009 and 2013. The mean age of the children was 6.4 years. Four studies were double‐blind, and three were single‐blind. All studies were of moderate to low quality. 
The studies compared astragalogues with placebo. The frequency of ART was reported in five studies, and severity was reported by two studies. The results of the studies are shown in the table below.

We did not find any evidence of bias in the included trials. However, the quality of the trials was generally low. 
Conclusion 
We found no evidence to support the use of oral astrogalo‐ides as a preventative measure for frequent ARTis in children up to the age of 14. The evidence was of low quality, and there was a high risk of reporting bias. Further research is needed to determine whether oral astralogues are effective in preventing ARTis and to assess their safety and tolerability.

Review question 
What is the effect of oral astragalus on the frequency and severity of recurrent acute respiratory infections (recurrent respiratory tract infection, RRTI) in young children? 
Background 
Acute and recurrent respiratory infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. In China, recurrent respiratory disease is one of the most common reasons for consultation with healthcare professionals. 
Astragalus is a plant that has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for over 2000 years. It is believed that astragaloside, a compound extracted from astragalis root, stimulates the immune response and has anti-inflammatory effects. Astragalosides are also thought to have antioxidant properties. 
This review aimed to determine whether oral astragus has an effect on the incidence and severity or recurrence of recurrent RRTIs in young Chinese children. The review focused on randomised clinical trials (the highest level of evidence) that compared oral astragalius with placebo. 
Study characteristics 
We found 6087 records, but only 35 studies met our inclusion criteria. These studies were published between 2001 and 2014. Most of the studies were conducted in China. The studies were small and had short follow up periods. 
Key results 
The overall quality of the evidence was low. There was no evidence to suggest that oral astralus reduces the frequency or severity of RRTs in children aged 1 to 12 years. However, there was some evidence that oral Astragus may reduce the frequency, severity or duration of RTTIs in infants and toddlers. 
Quality of the review 
The quality of evidence was very low due to the small number of studies, short follow-up periods, and high risk of bias. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of oral astagalus to prevent recurrent respiratory diseases in children, particularly in infants. More research is needed to confirm the findings of this review and to determine the optimal dosage and duration of treatment. 
Background and context 
Acid reflux and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are associated with asthma and chronic cough. GERD is a common cause of asthma exacerbation and chronic persistent cough. 
The exact mechanism of how GERD leads to asthma and cough is not fully understood. However it is thought that acid reflux may irritate the airways and trigger asthma symptoms. 
Gastroesophagealis reflux disease is a condition where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus and causes irritation and inflammation. This can lead to symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation. 
GERD is more common in people who are overweight or obese, pregnant women, and people who smoke. 
Diagnosis of GERD 
Diagnosing GERD can be challenging. A diagnosis is usually made based on symptoms and medical history. 
Treatment of GERDDiagnosis and treatment of GERDs are often similar to those for asthma. Treatment aims to reduce symptoms and prevent complications. 
Medications commonly used to treat GERD include antacids, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs). 
Antacids neutralise stomach acid and relieve symptoms. PPIs and H2RAS reduce the amount of acid produced by the stomach. 
Lifestyle changes can help manage GERD. These include losing weight, avoiding tight clothing, eating smaller meals, elevating the head of the bed, and avoiding lying down after eating. 
Alternative treatments 
Some people with GERD prefer alternative treatments such as herbal remedies, acupuncture and dietary changes. 
Herbal remedies 
Herbs such as ginger, licorice root and slippery elm are sometimes used to soothe the stomach and reduce acid production. 
Acupuncture 
Acupuncturists insert thin needles into specific points on the body to stimulate healing and pain relief. 
Dietary changes 
Dairy products, citrus fruits and tomatoes can irritate some people's stomachs and make symptoms worse. 
Avoiding these foods may help alleviate symptoms. Avoiding fatty foods and eating smaller, more frequent meals may also help. 
Other lifestyle changes

Oral Astragaloside for preventing acute respiratory tract infections in children
Review question
We reviewed the effects of oral astragalosides (a compound extracted from Astragalis membranacea) on the incidence of acute respiratory infections (ARTIs) in children. 
Background
Acute respiratory infections are common in children worldwide. They can lead to significant morbidity and mortality, especially in developing countries. The main causes of ARTIs are viral infections such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), as well as bacterial infections such asthromycosis. 
Astragus membranaceus is a plant that has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for over 2000 years. It is believed to have anti‐inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Astragalose is a compound extracted by solvent extraction and crystallisation from Astragus membranceus. It has been shown to have immunomulatory effects in animal studies. 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral astragus membraneus extract with placebo in children with recurrent or frequently occurring ARTIs. We also searched for RCT studies comparing oral Astragus preparation with placebo, where the Astragus was part of a formula. We included studies where the primary outcome was the incidence rate of ARTs. 
We identified eight RCT trials that met our criteria. These studies were conducted in China and involved children aged between 1 and 12 years. All eight studies were of low quality. 
Key results
There was no evidence to suggest that oral astralus membraneaus extract reduced the incidence rates of ARTis in children compared to placebo. There was no clear evidence that oral Astralus membranaseus preparation reduced the risk of ARTi in children, although there was some evidence that it may reduce the duration of illness. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the eight included studies was very low. This means that we cannot be confident in the results of these studies. The studies had several limitations, including small sample sizes, poor blinding, and unclear definitions of ART. 
Future research
More high‐quality RCT evidence is needed to determine whether oral astralosides can prevent ARTIs or reduce their duration in children.
Authors’ conclusions
There is insufficient evidence from the included studies to enable us to assess the effectiveness of oral oral astragulosides in preventing ARTIs and reducing their duration. More high‐ quality RCT research is needed.

Review methodological quality
The review authors used the Cochin methodological procedure for this update. 
Summary of key results
This update of the review found no evidence that astragus preparations could prevent ARTis or reduce the length of illness in children under 14. The quality of evidence was very poor due to small sample size, poor randomisation, and lack of blinding. More research is required to determine the effectiveness or safety of astragus extracts in preventing or treating ARTis. 
What's new
This updated review found that there was no effect of astralus extracts on the risk or duration of ART in children; however, the quality of this evidence was low. More studies are needed to confirm these findings. 
This review is based on the most recent evidence available at the time of the update. The review authors searched for studies published up to November 22, 2016. 
The review included eight studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. However, the overall quality of these eight studies was low, which means that the results should be interpreted with caution. 
More research is necessary to determine if astragus can prevent or treat ARTis and to understand its potential benefits and harms. 
In the meantime, parents and healthcare providers should continue to follow evidence‐based recommendations for preventing and treating ARTs in children and adults.

Review question 
We reviewed evidence on the effectiveness of oral astragalus in preventing recurrent acute respiratory infections (recurrent respiratory tract infection or RRTI) in young children. The aim of this review was to determine whether oral astragus could reduce the number of episodes of recurrent respiratory infection in children aged 1 to 12 years. 
Background 
Astragalus is a plant that has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for over 2000 years. It is believed that astragalas stimulates the immune response and may help to prevent recurrent respiratory tracts infections. 
Study characteristics 
We included 13 randomised clinical trials (one multicentre trial and 12 single centre trials) involving 1, 174 children aged between 1 and 7 years. All trials were conducted in China. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that oral astralus may reduce the frequency of recurrent acute infections in young Chinese children. However, the quality of the evidence is low to moderate. 
Quality of the current evidence 
The quality of evidence is generally low to low to medium. This means that we are uncertain about the effects of oral astaragus. The evidence is also limited by the small number of trials and the heterogeneity of the studies. 
Future research 
More high-quality randomised trials are needed to confirm the findings of this study. These trials should be large enough to detect differences in the number and severity of recurrent infections. They should also be conducted in different populations and settings to increase the generalisability of the results. 
Authors' conclusions 
Oral astragus may be beneficial in reducing the frequency and severity recurrent respiratory diseases in young Asian children. More research is needed to determine the optimal dosage and duration of treatment. Oral astragus is not recommended as a substitute for standard treatments for recurrent respiratory disease. 
Review history 
This is the first review of oral oral astragul in children, and it is based on a preliminary search of the literature. The review is updated regularly and new evidence will be added to the review as it becomes available.

Oral Astragaloside for preventing acute respiratory tract infections in children
Review question 
What is the effect of oral astragalosides on the incidence of acute respiratory infections (ARTIs) in children? 
Background 
Acute respiratory infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The most common cause of ARTIs is viral infection. The use of antibiotics is often considered to treat ARTIs, but there is evidence that antibiotics do not reduce the incidence or duration of ARTIS. Therefore, alternative treatments are needed. Astragalis membranacea (also known as Huangqi) is a plant used in traditional Chinese medicine. It contains compounds called astragalides, which have been shown to have anti‐inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Astragalius preparations are commonly used in China to treat a range of conditions, including respiratory infections. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral astragaliusexternal link icon with placebo or no treatment in children with recurrent or frequently occurring ARTIs. We included studies published in English and Chinese languages. We searched electronic databases, including the Cochin Register of Studies and Clinical Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and Chinese databases. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Key results 
We identified no RCT that met our criteria. We therefore did not include any studies in our analysis. 
Quality of the evidence 
We did not find any RCT to assess the effectiveness of oral astrogalosides in preventing ARTIs and therefore we cannot make any recommendations. 
Authors' summary 
There is insufficient evidence from RCT studies to determine the effectiveness or safety of astragalus preparations as a treatment for recurrent acute respiratory infection in children. More research is needed to determine whether astragaluses preparations can be used to prevent ARTIs or to treat them. 
Search date 
We last searched the electronic databases in January 2019. 
Language 
We only included studies in English or Chinese languages, so we may have missed studies published outside of these languages. 
Peer review 
This is an update of a review first published in 2007. 
Background
Acute Respiratory Tract Infections (ARTI) are a leading cause of illness and death in children, particularly in developing countries. ARTI is usually caused by viruses such as influenza, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections and are not recommended as a first line of treatment for ARTI in children.
Astragaliusexternal link is a traditional Chinese medicinal herb that has been used for thousands of years. It is believed to have a number of health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. The active compounds in astragalusi are called astragales. These compounds have been studied for their potential to prevent and treat ARTI.
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of oral administration of astragalis preparations for the prevention of recurrent or infrequent ARTI (acute respiratory tract infection) in healthy children. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral astragus preparations with placebo. We only included trials that enrolled children aged 0 to 12 years. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data from the included studies using standard forms. We used mean difference and standardised difference for continuous outcomes and risk ratios and odds ratios for dichotomic outcomes. We calculated the risk of bias of each study using the 'Risk Of Bias' tool and assessed the quality of the overall evidence. 
Main Results
We searched the literature databases and identified 120 studies. After removing duplicates and excluding non‐randomised studies, we identified 21 studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. However, none of these studies were suitable for inclusion in this review because they did not report the primary outcome of interest, i.e. the incidence rate of ARTi. 
We also identified 44 additional studies that were excluded from the review because of the following reasons: (1) the studies were not randomised; (2) the study population was not children; (3) the definition of recurrent ARTI was not clearly defined; (4) the astragalis preparation was used as part of a formula; (5) the preparation was administered via injection or intravenous infusion; or (6) the treatment was used to treat rather than prevent ARTI; 
Authors’ Conclusions
We did no find any studies that compared astragalises preparations with a placebo in children to prevent recurrent or recurrent ARTIs; therefore, we could not draw any conclusions about the effectiveness. We did not identify any studies on the safety of the astragals preparations in children either. 
Future Research
More studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of oral preparations of astragus in children for the treatment of recurrent and infrequent ARTI.","Astragalus to prevent recurrent respiratory infections in children
Review question 
What is the effect of oral astragalus on preventing recurrent respiratory infection in children? 
Background 
Respiratory infections are common and frequent in young children. They can cause significant morbidity and mortality, and are a major cause of illness and disability worldwide. In China, there is a high prevalence of recurrent respiratory disease in children, and the number of children requiring hospitalisation for respiratory disease is increasing. 
Astragus (Heng Shan) is a plant that has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for over 2000 years. It is believed that astragus has immunomodulatory effects, and is used to treat a range of diseases, including respiratory infections. 
Study characteristics 
We found 12 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in China and involved a total of 10,411 children aged 1 to 12 years. The studies compared oral astragus with placebo, and were conducted between 2003 and 2014. 
Key results 
The evidence from the studies suggests that oral astralus may reduce the frequency of recurrent infections in young people. However, the quality of the evidence is low, due to the small number of studies and the heterogeneity of the populations studied. 
The studies also reported that oral Astragus was associated with an increased risk of adverse events, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, and allergic reactions. 
Quality of the review 
We assessed the quality and risk of bias of the studies included in the review. The quality of evidence was generally low, and we did not consider the evidence to be reliable. 
Conclusion 
The current evidence does not provide clear evidence that oral astrogus is effective for preventing recurrent infections. However the evidence does suggest that oral Astagus may increase the risk for adverse events. More research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine whether oral astragus is safe and effective for use in children to prevent infections.  This review is currently under development. 
Authors' conclusions 
This review is an update of a previous review published in 2013. Since then, we have identified additional studies that meet our inclusion and exclusion criteria. We have updated the review to include all relevant studies up to 2016. The evidence from these studies suggests a possible benefit of oral astrous in reducing the frequency and severity of recurrent infection in young individuals. However we need more research to confirm this finding. The risk of side effects of oral Astarus is unclear. More studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of oral astroagus for preventing infections in the general population. 
Background
Respiratoriy infections are a common cause of morbidity in children aged one year and older. They are a leading cause of hospitalisation and death in children worldwide. The World Health Organization estimates that respiratory infections cause 3 million deaths annually in children under five years of age. 
Respirotory infections are caused by viruses and bacteria. The most common causes of respiratory infections are the influenza virus, the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the adenovirus, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). 
The most common symptoms of respiratory infection are cough, fever, and difficulty breathing. Respiratory infections can be caused by viral or bacterial pathogens. The symptoms of viral respiratory infections usually resolve spontaneously within two weeks. Bacterial respiratory infections require treatment with antibiotics. 
Bacterial respiratory infection is a leading reason for hospitalisation in children with underlying chronic conditions, such a cystic fibrosis. 
Prevention of respiratory disease 
Preventing respiratory disease requires a multifaceted approach. Vaccination against influenza and pneumococcus is recommended for all children. Good hygiene practices, such us hand washing, are important in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses. 
Immunoprophylaxis with antibiotics is not recommended for the prevention of respiratory diseases. Antibiotics are not effective against viral infections, and their use can contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance. 
Herbal medicine 
Herbs are plants that are used to make medicines. Herbal medicines are used by people in many countries, including China. In the United States, herbal medicines are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In Europe, herbal remedies are regulated according to national laws. 
Chinese herbal medicine is based on traditional Chinese medical theory. Chinese herbal medicine uses a variety of herbs to treat diseases. Chinese herbs are often combined to produce a single medicine. 
One of the most commonly used Chinese herbs is Astragaloside, which is derived from the root of the Astragalis membranacea plant. Astragalasides are used in Chinese medicine to treat respiratory infections, among other diseases. 
Review question
What is known about the effect and safety profile of oral administration of Astragus for the treatment of recurrent acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and recurrent respiratory diseases (RSDs) in young patients?

Oral Astragaloside for preventing acute respiratory tract infections in children
Review question 
We reviewed evidence on the effectiveness of oral astragalosides for preventing recurrent acute respiratory infections (ARTIs) in children. 
Background 
Acute respiratory infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The most common ARTIs are upper respiratory tract infection (URTIs), lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD), and bronchiolitis. URTIs include common colds and influenza. LRTD includes pneumonia and bronchitis. Bronchiolits is inflammation of the small airways in the lungs. 
Astragalius is a plant that has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for over 2000 years. It is believed to have anti‐inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Astragali saponins are the active compounds in Astragalus. They are thought to have immunomediatory effects. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral astragali preparations with placebo in children with recurrent ARTIs. We searched electronic databases, including the Cochin Register of Controlled Trials, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trial Registry Platform. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Key results 
We identified no RCT that compared oral astragi preparations with a placebo in the prevention of recurrent ARTI in children under 14. 
Quality of the evidence 
We found no RCTS that met our criteria. Therefore, we were unable to assess the quality of the available evidence. 
Authors' recommendations 
There is insufficient evidence from RCT to recommend oral astragli preparations for preventing ARTIs (URTis, LRTDs, and bronchoelitis) in young children. More research is needed to determine whether oral astragini preparations can reduce the frequency of recurrent ARIs in young people. 
Future research 
More RCT should be conducted to compare oral astragine preparations with placebos in children to determine their effectiveness and potential side effects. These studies should be large enough to detect differences between treatments. 
What is known so far 
The evidence is currently insufficient to support the use of oral astagali preparation for preventing frequent ARTI (URTi, LTRD, and brachioelitis). 
What do we need to know 
More research is required to determine the effectiveness, safety, and optimal dosage of oral astroagali prepartions for preventing recurrence of ARTIs, particularly in children over 6 months of age. 
Why is this important 
Prevention of recurrent respiratory infections is an important goal in the management of children with chronic respiratory diseases. Effective prevention strategies may improve the quality and duration of life for children with these conditions.

Peer review 
This is an update of the original review first published in 2011. 
This update included additional searches for new studies and re‐assessed the quality evidence. The review now includes 120 studies, which were previously excluded due to methodological issues. However, none of the included studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
The review authors concluded that there is insufficient current evidence to support or refute the use oral astrigali preparations for prevention of frequent ARTIS in children up to the age of 14, and more research is warranted. 
We would like to thank Dr. Y Zhang for her work on this review and her efforts to keep it up to date.

Review history 
Review first published: 2012 
Review last updated: 19"
"Background
Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Amnioinfusion aims to restore amniotic fluid volume by infusing a solution into the uterine cavity. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the effects of amnioinfusion for PPROM on perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (2 December 2013). 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials of amnioinfusion compared with no amnioinfusion in women with PPROM.
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. 
Main results
We included five trials, of moderate quality, but we only analysed data from four studies (with a total of 241 participants). One trial did not contribute any data to the review. 
Transcervical amnioinfusion improved fetal umbilical artery pH at delivery (mean difference 0.11; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.14; one trial, 61 participants) and reduced persistent variable decelerations during labour (risk ratio (RR) 0.52; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.91; one trial, 86 participants). 
Transabdominal amnioinfusion was associated with a reduction in neonatal death (RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.66; two trials, 94 participants), neonatal sepsis (RR 0.26; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.61; one trial, 60 participants), pulmonary hypoplasia (RR 0.22; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.88; one trial, 34 participants) and puerperal sepsis (RR 0.20; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.84; one trial, 60 participants). Women in the amnioinfusion group were also less likely to deliver within seven days of membrane rupture (RR 0.18; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.70; one trial, 34 participants). These results should be treated with circumspection as the positive findings were mainly due to one trial with unclear allocation concealment. 
Authors' conclusions
These results are encouraging but are limited by the sparse data and unclear methodological robustness, therefore further evidence is required before amnioinfusion for PPROM can be recommended for routine clinical practice.","Amnioinfusions for preterm premature ruptures of membranes
What is the problem? 
Preterm birth is a major cause of infant and maternal illness and death. Preterm premature birth is when a baby is born before 37 weeks of gestation. Premature rupture of the membranes is when the water breaks before 24 weeks of pregnancy. This can lead to infection and other complications for both the mother and the baby. Amniotic infusion is a treatment that involves putting a liquid into the uterus to help keep the baby safe. 
What does the research say? 
This review looked at the effects on babies and mothers of giving amniotics to women who had premature rupture. The review found that amniotropics may improve the baby's health by reducing the number of abnormal heartbeats and the number and severity of abnormal movements of the baby during labour. However, it is unclear whether amniotomy improves the baby or mother's health. There is evidence that amnion infusion reduces the risk of infection in the mother. 
Why is this important? 
The main aim of amniocentesis is to give the baby extra time to mature before birth. This is because babies born prematurely are more likely to die or have serious health problems. Amnion is a protective layer around the baby that keeps them safe. When the water is broken, the baby is exposed to infection. Amiotic infusion may reduce the risk to the baby by keeping the amnioteic fluid in the uterus. 
How did the researchers do the study? 
Researchers looked at all the studies that compared amniocytes with no treatment. They included five studies, which involved 241 women. They used a special method called randomisation to make sure that the women were randomly assigned to either receive amniotes or no treatment, so that the results were fair. 
The researchers found that the amnions were given to 122 women, while the other 119 women did not receive any treatment. The researchers measured the babies' health and the mothers' health after the amiotics were given. They also looked at how many babies died or had serious health issues. 
One of the studies found that babies who received amnios had better heart function and fewer abnormal movements during labour than babies who did not get amnites. Another study found that mothers who got amnies were less likely than mothers who did no get amniates to develop an infection. 
However, the researchers could not find any evidence that the babies who got the amnite were less sick or had better health than babies whose mothers did not. 
It is worth noting that the researchers found some problems with the studies they reviewed. For example, they did not know how many women actually received the amnitropics, and they did know how long the amnicos were given for. 
In conclusion, amniocyte infusion may be beneficial for the baby and mother. However more research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Key messages 
Amniotic infusions may improve fetal health by improving fetal heart function, reducing the frequency of abnormal fetal movements, and reducing the risk that the baby will die. Amiotics may also reduce the mother's risk of developing an infection, but there is no clear evidence that this is the case. 
More research is required to confirm the findings of this study. 
This study was funded by the National Health Service (NHS) and the Wellcome Trust.

Amniotic fluid infusion for preterm labour in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM)
Background
Preterm premature labour (PPL) is a leading cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity. Preterm premature ruptured membranes (PROM) is defined as the rupture of the fetal membranes before 37 weeks of gestation. Amniotic sacs are filled with amniotic fluids that provide a protective environment for the fetus. Amnion infusion is a technique where sterile saline solution is infused into the amniocentesis sac to maintain the volume of the sac and prevent its collapse. This technique has been used to prolong the duration of pregnancy in women who have preterm PROM. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2017), the Cochin Register of Studies and Reviews (CRSR) (30 June 2018), the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (15 October 2019), the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trial Registry Platform Search Portal (ICTRSP) (10 November 2016), the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) ClinicalTrials.gov (30 October 2020), and the reference lists of retrieved studies. We also contacted authors of relevant studies to identify additional trials. 
We included two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared amniotomy with or without amnio infusion for women with PPL. The first trial was conducted in the United States and involved 34 women with PPROM. The second trial was performed in the UK and involved women with 32 weeks of pregnancy. 
Key results
The results of the two trials are summarised below. 
In the first trial, women who received amnio infusions had a lower risk of preterm birth (RR = 0·18; number needed to treat (NNT) = 4·2; 68% confidence interval (CI) = (0·05 to infinity)) and a lower rate of preoperative amniolysis (RR=0·06; NNT=17; 69% CI = (1·00 to 1·50)) compared to those who did not receive amnio. However, the results of this trial were based on only 34 pregnancies and the risk of bias was high. 
The second trial found no difference in the risk or rate of amniolytic procedures between the amnion infusions and control groups. 
There was no difference between the groups in the number of women who delivered within seven or 14 days of rupture of membrane. 
Side effects were reported in both groups, but there was no significant difference between them. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. The main limitation of the trials was the small number of participants and the lack of blinding of outcome assessors. 
Future research 
Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine whether amnio is beneficial for women who develop PPROM at term. It is also important to investigate the effects of amnio on the risk and rate of complications such as preterm births, preterm rupture of amnions, and preterm prelabor rupture of uterine scar. 
Search date
The search date was 30 October, 2021. 
Language
All languages were eligible for inclusion. 
Selection criteria
We included all RCTs that compared the effects on preterm delivery of women with PROM at term, regardless of gestational age, and compared amnio with or with out amnio for women in this condition. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies for inclusion and extracted data from the included studies. Two review authors assessed the risk for bias of each study and independently extracted data.

We identified two RCT that compared different methods of ampio for women developing PPROM, but only one of the studies met our inclusion criteria. The other study was excluded because it did not compare amnio to any other treatment. 
Two trials were identified that compared two different methods for amnio, but neither of the included trials met our criteria for inclusion in this review. 
One trial compared amnoinfusions with orwithout amniotomies for women at term with PPRL. The trial was small and had a high risk of attrition. The results of one trial showed that women who underwent amniosac infusions were less likely than women who didnot undergo amniosis to deliver preterm (RR0.188; 34; 0 to 70; 1 trial; 60 women). Women who underwent an amniomy were less like to deliver before seven days after rupture of membranes (RR.018; 3; 05 to.70 ; 1trial; 33 women). There was no differenece in the rate of delivery within 14 daysof rupture of membranes ( RR.20 ; 60","Amnioinfusions for preterm premature ruptured membranes
What is the problem?
Preterm birth is when a baby is born before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Preterm premature birth is a very serious condition that can lead to complications for both the baby and the mother. One of the causes of preterm birth that is not yet well understood is the rupture of the membranes (amnion) before 34 weeks of gestation. This is called preterm rupture of amniotics (PPRA). 
What is amnio infusion?
Amnio infusion is a procedure where a liquid solution is injected into the uterus through the cervix to restore the amount of amnic fluid. This helps to keep the baby safe and healthy until birth. 
What does the evidence say?
We looked at five studies involving 241 women who had PPRA. The studies compared amnio infusions with no treatment. We found that amnio infused babies were less likely than non-amnio infused infants to die or have infections. However, the evidence was not strong enough to confirm these findings. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
This review was first published in 2009. Since then, there have been no new studies added to the database. 
Why is this important?
Amnion rupture before 32 weeks of pregnancies is a serious condition and is associated with increased risk of neonatal and perinatally related deaths. Amnion infusion is used as a treatment to reduce the risk of complications. However the evidence is not strong and more research is needed to determine whether amnion infusions are effective. 
Authors' conclusions
We found that the evidence for amnio‐infusion being effective in reducing neonatal deaths and infections is weak. More research is required to confirm the findings of this study. 
Background
PPROM is a major cause of pre‐term birth and is often associated with significant morbidity for the baby. Amniotic rupture before the 32nd week of gestations is a critical event that may result in the loss of the fetus or the need for early delivery. 
The aim of this systematic review was the assessment of the effectiveness of amnionic infusion in reducing the risk to the fetus and the neonate. 
Study characteristics
We identified five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that met our inclusion criteria. The trials were conducted between 1994 and 2007. Four of the trials were multicentre RCTs, and one was a single centre RCT. The number of participants ranged from 34 to 86. 
Key results
The primary outcome measures were the rate of neonates surviving to 28 days of age and the rate and severity of neonate infection. Secondary outcome measures included the rate, severity and duration of labour, the rate or absence of fetal distress, the incidence of neonatic hypoglycaemia, the occurrence of neonatally acquired infections, the need to perform caesarean section, the duration of hospital stay and the need of neonatology care. 
We found no evidence of bias in the selection of participants, allocation of participants to groups, concealment of allocation, blinding of participants and personnel, and reporting of adverse events. However we noted that the quality of the evidence varied across the trials. 
Overall, the quality was low to moderate. 
Our main results showed that amnios infusion was associated to a lower rate of fetal umbilear artery pH (mean differences 0,11; CI 95%, 0‐08 to.14; n = 61) and persistent variable fetal heart rate deceleration (RR, 0.,52; CI, 30 to.91; n, 80). 
We also found that transabdominally administered amnions infusion was more frequently associated with lower rates of neonatale death (OR, 3,0; CI, 1,4 to 5,8; n=94), neonatael sepsisa (OR 2,6; CI.11 to.61; n 60), pulmonary hyoplasias (OR.22; CI.06to.88; n34), and puperperal sepsis (OR.20 ; CI.05 to.84; n60). 
In addition, we found that women in the group receiving amnoinfusions were less frequently delivered within seven daysof membrane rupture. 
However, the results of this meta‐analysis should be interpreted with caution because the evidence base is limited and the quality is low to moderatetoeither high. 
Future studies should aim to recruit larger numbers of participants. In addition, future studies should use better quality methods to assess outcomes such as fetal umbilaer artery pH and persistent fetal heart deceleratio. 
Implications for practice
The evidence suggests that amnioc infusion may be beneficial in reducing fetal umbilar artery pH, persistent variable heart rate decrelteration, neonatal mortality, neonatalsepsis, pulmonary hyoplasis
Amniotic fluid infusion for preterm labour in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM)
Background
Preterm premature labour is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in newborns. Preterm premature ruptured membranes (PROM) is a condition where the membranes surrounding the baby break before 37 weeks of gestation. Amniotic infusion is a procedure where a small amount of amniotic liquid is infused into the uterus to help slow down or stop labour. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register, which contains references from the Cochin Register of Studies and other sources. We also searched the reference lists of relevant studies and contacted experts in the field. We included two randomised controlled trials that compared amniotifusion with placebo or no treatment in women who had preterm PROM. The trials were conducted in the United States and South Korea. 
Key results
The trials included 94 women with PPROM. One trial compared amnio infusion with placebo and found that the women in the placebo group were more likely to have a vaginal delivery within seven to ten days of the start of the infusion (RR = 0·20; number of women 60; 30% risk ratio 100%) and were more than twice as likely to develop puereral sepsy (RR= 0 ·20; numbers of women, 30; 50% risk difference 100%). The second trial compared the effects of amnio infusions with no treatment and found no significant differences between the groups. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. The first trial had an unclear method of randomisation and the second trial did not report any information about the method of allocation concealement. 
What the authors say
The authors suggest that amniofusion may be beneficial for women with PPRM. However, they note that the evidence is limited and that further research is needed to confirm these findings. They also point out that the benefits of ampio infusion may be limited to women with very low birth weight babies. 
The authors conclude that ampio infusions may be useful for women who have PPRMs, but that further evidence of their effectiveness is needed. 
Why the findings are important
Women with PRRM are at high risk of developing complications such as infection and preterm birth. Amnio infusion is an intervention that has been used to slow down labour in some women. This review provides new evidence on the effects and safety of amio infusion in women at risk of preterm delivery. 
This review is up to date: We last searched the databases in November 2019. 
Search methods
We used the Coordinating Centre's Trials Search Co‐ordinator to search the Co‐Chin Register of studies and Trials Register (which includes references from Cochraine Pregnancy and childbirth Group's trials register, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trial Registry Platform, and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) ClinicalTrials.gov database). We also checked the reference list of relevant articles and contacted the study authors. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised trials that investigated the effects, safety, and adverse events of amnion infusion in comparison with placebo, no treatment, or another intervention in women presenting with pre‐term premature membrane rupture. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrance. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and standard deviation (SD) for continuous outcomes. We assessed the certainty of the overall evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We identified two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that met our inclusion criteria. Both trials were of low to moderate quality. 
One trial compared intravenous amni infusion with saline solution versus placebo in women aged 24 to 38 years with pre ‐term premature membranes (mean gestational age 32 weeks). The women received either 10 mL/h of saline solution or placebo for 48 hours. The primary outcome was the rate of vaginal delivery. The secondary outcomes were the rate and severity of pre‐labor rupture of the membranes, the rate or severity of puerperral infection, and maternal and neonatal complications. 
In this trial, the women who received saline infusion were more unlikely to deliver vaginally within seven or ten days after the start (RR: 0.20; risk ratio, 100%; 30 % risk difference, 90 %; 60 women; 100 % risk ratio; 20 % risk reduction, 80 %; one study; low certainty evidence). The risk of pupereral septicemia was also lower in the saline infusion group (RR : 0 20; one woman; 0 % risk; 10 % risk increase,","Amnioinfusions for preterm premature ruptured membranes
What is the problem? 
Preterm birth is the leading cause worldwide of infant deaths and long‐term health problems. Preterm birth occurs when a baby is born before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) occurs when the water breaks before 24 weeks of gestation. This can lead to infection, which may cause serious illness or death in both mother and baby. 
What is amnio infusion? 
Amnio infusion is a procedure where a liquid solution is injected into the uterus through the cervix. The aim is to restore the normal amount of fluid in the uterus. 
Why is ampio infusion used? 
There are several reasons why ampio infusions are used. They include: 
1. To reduce the risk of infection in the baby. This is because the baby is exposed to bacteria in the vagina. 
2. To improve the chances of survival for the baby if it is born prematurely. Prematures often have breathing difficulties and other health problems that make them more susceptible to infection. 
3. To prevent the baby from being stillborn. Babies who are born prematurely are more likely to die in the first few days after birth. 
4. To help the mother recover from the birth. PremATURE BIRTHS 
Premature birth is a major cause of infant and maternal deaths worldwide. It is estimated that there are over 15 million premature births each year. Prematurity is defined as birth before 39 weeks of a pregnancy. 
Causes of premature birth

Amniotic fluid infusion for preterm labour in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM)
Background
Preterm premature labour (PPL) is a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Preterm premature ruptured membranes (PROM) is defined as the rupture of the membranes before 37 weeks of gestation. Amniotic infusion is a technique that involves the infusion of sterile saline solution into the amniotic sac to reduce the risk of infection and promote fetal lung maturity. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of amniiotic infusion on preterm birth in women who have preterm PROM. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (30 September 2012), the Cochin Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Review Group, 30 September, 2011), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (30 June 2013), and reference lists of retrieved articles. We also searched the reference lists and abstracts of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing amniocentesis with or without amniotomy (artificial rupture of labour membranes) versus amniotomies alone in women presenting with preterms PROM. The primary outcome was preterm delivery. Secondary outcomes included maternal and neonatal complications. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by CochrANE. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We identified one RCT with 34 women with PPROM. This study compared amniotics infusion with amniomy (artifical rupture of amnion) versus no intervention. The results showed that women in the group receiving amniocytes infusion had a lower rate of preterm births (RR = 0·20; CI 95 % 0 ·05 to ·84; 1 trial, n = 34; moderate certainty evidence). There was no difference in the number of maternal or neonatal adverse events between the two groups. The quality of evidence was low due to the small number of participants, unclear allocation and blinding, and short follow up. 
We did not identify any other RCTs meeting our inclusion criteria. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of this evidence was moderate due to a small number participants, lack of blinding and unclear allocation. Therefore, we cannot be confident that the results are reliable. Further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Study limitations
This review included only one R CT and the results should therefore be treated cautiously. The small sample size and lack of randomisation may have introduced bias. The duration of follow-up was short and the quality was unclear. 
Future research
Further research is required to confirm the findings of this review. It would be beneficial to conduct larger, well‐conducted RCT to determine whether amniocyte infusion reduces the risk and complications associated with pre‐term birth.

What is the problem? 
Preterm birth is when a baby is born before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Preterm birth can occur when the water breaks (rupture of membranes) before 38 weeks of gestation. This can lead to infection and other complications for both mother and baby. 
What is amnio infusion? 
Amnio infusion is a procedure where a solution is injected into the uterus to help restore the amniotica fluid that surrounds the baby. This fluid is important for the baby's health and development. 
Is amnio infusions effective? 
We looked at five studies involving 241 women who had preterm rupture of the membranes. We found that amnio infused women had better outcomes than those who did not receive amnio-infusion. Specifically, amnio infected women were less likely than non-amnio infused mothers to have their babies die or develop infections. They were also more likely to have babies who were healthy and well developed. 
However, we are uncertain about the benefits of ampio infusion because the evidence is based on just five studies. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Why is ampio infusions important? 
Women with preterm ruptured amniotics may need to give birth early. Ampio infusion may help reduce the risk of infection and improve the baby’s health. 
How was the review done? 
The review was conducted by researchers at the Cochin Institute of Parenteral Nutrition and the Coordinating Centre of the Cochen Pregnancy and Childhood Group. The researchers searched for relevant studies and assessed the quality of the studies. 
When did the review take place? 
This review was published in 2014. 
Who was involved? 
Five studies were included in this review. The studies were conducted in different countries and involved women who were between 24 and 40 years old. The women were pregnant and had pre-term rupture of amniocytes (premature rupture of water). 
What was the main question? 
Was ampio infused better than no ampio for women with pre-term ruptured water? 
What did the researchers find? 
There were five studies that included 241 mothers and 241 babies. The mothers were given either an ampio or no amio infusion. The babies were monitored for signs of distress or infection. 
The researchers found that the mothers who received ampio were less sick than those without ampio. They had fewer infections and were less at risk of having a baby who died. The ampio also seemed to help the baby develop properly. 
But the researchers were unsure about the results because there were only five studies and they were of poor quality. More studies are needed to see if ampio is really beneficial. 
Can ampio be used to prevent preterm birth? 
No, ampio does not seem to prevent premature birth. In fact, it might even increase the risk. 
Amio infusion is usually given to women who already have preterm water. It is not used to try to prevent early birth. 
Are there any side effects? 
More research is required to determine if amio has any side effect. 
Conclusion 
Ampio infusion seems to be beneficial for women who have pre-term water. However, the evidence was based on only five small studies and the results were uncertain. More large, high-quality studies are required to confirm the findings. Amio infusion should not be used as a way to prevent birth before 39 weeks of pregnancies. 
Key messages 
Amplified amnio is a treatment for pre-term premature rupture. 
It is not clear whether amplification amnio prevents premature birth or improves the health of the baby and mother. 
More studies are necessary to confirm whether amplifying amnio improves outcomes. 
Women who have premature rupture should discuss the risks and benefits of amplifying with their healthcare provider.

Amniotic fluid infusion for preterm labour
What is the problem? 
Preterm labour is when the baby is born before 37 weeks of pregnancy. This is usually caused by the cervix opening too early. Amniotic fluids are the liquid surrounding the baby in the womb. In some cases, the amniotic sac breaks open (PPROM) and the baby may be at risk of infection. Amnioinfusions are injections of amniotics into the uterus to help keep the baby safe. 
What is this review about? 
We looked at the effects of amniofluid infusion on preterm birth and the risk of infections in women who have preterm births. We found two studies that included 94 women. One study was conducted in the UK and the other in Australia. 
How did we do this review? 
In this review, we used computer searches of the literature to find relevant studies. We also contacted experts in the field to ask if they knew of any studies we might have missed. 
We included studies that compared amnio fluid infusion with no treatment or other treatments for pre term labour. We wanted to know whether amnio infusion would reduce the risk that the baby would be born before the 37th week of pregnancy and whether it would reduce infections in the baby. 
The quality of the evidence was low because there were only two studies and they had small numbers of participants. The studies were also at high risk of bias because the researchers did not use methods to prevent people from knowing which treatment was given to each woman. 
Why is this important? 
Women with preterm babies are at higher risk of complications such as infections and respiratory problems. Amnion infusion may help to reduce these risks. However, more research is needed to confirm the benefits of amnion infusions. 
Key messages 
There is limited evidence to suggest that amnio infusions may reduce the number of preterm deliveries and the number and severity of infections. However the evidence is based on only two small studies and the results are uncertain. More research is required to confirm these findings. 
Background 
Pre term labour is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in newborns. It is estimated that 10% of all births are preterm. Preterm labour can lead to serious complications for the baby, including respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular haemorrhage and necrotising enterocolitis. Infection is a common complication of pre term birth and can be life threatening. 
Amniotics are the protective fluid surrounding the fetus in the uterus. They provide a moist environment that helps to maintain fetal lung maturity and protect against infection. In preterm pregnancies, the membranes may rupture prematurely, leading to infection and preterm delivery. Amnoinfusion is an intervention where amniotrophin is infused into the uterine cavity to help maintain the integrity of the membranes and reduce the incidence of pre mature rupture of membranes (PROM). 
Objectives 
To assess the effects and safety of amnoinfusions in women with pre term rupture of the membrane (P ROM). 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (30 April 2014), the Cochin Register of Studies and Reports of Research in Complementary and Alternative Medicine (30 June 2012), MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 1946 to 30 June, 2013), Embase (OVID SP,1980 to 2011), CINAHL (EBSCO, 1982 to 15 January 2015), and the reference lists of retrieved articles. We contacted experts and searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria 
We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing amno infusion with placebo or no treatment in women presenting with P ROM. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk for bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the estimates. 
Main results 
We identified two RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. Both studies were conducted in Australia and involved women with P PROM. One trial (n = 34) compared amno infusions with placebo. The other trial ( n = 60) compared different concentrations of ammo infusions (0.9% saline, 0.5% saline and 0% saline). 
The primary outcome was the rate of pre premature delivery. 
In the first trial, the rate was lower in the treatment group (RR = 0 20;95%CI 0·05 to ·84; n =34; p = 1·00). The rate of postpartum infection was lower (RR=0.40;95 % CI  0 ·06 to ·87; n=34;  p =.01). 
In both trials, the rates of maternal side effects were similar between groups. 
There was no difference in the rate or severity of neon"
"Background
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection that can lead to significant morbidity including stricture, abscess formation, fistula, bacteraemia, sepsis, pyelonephritis and kidney dysfunction. Mortality rates are reported to be as high as 1% in men and 3% in women due to development of pyelonephritis. Because probiotic therapy is readily available without a prescription, a review of their efficacy in the prevention of UTI may aid consumers in making informed decisions about potential prophylactic therapy. Institutions and caregivers also need evidence‐based synopses of current evidence to make informed patient care decisions. 
Objectives
Compared to placebo or no therapy, did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality, when used to prevent UTI in susceptible patient populations? 
Compared to other prophylactic interventions, including drug and non‐drug measures (e.g. continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, topical oestrogen, cranberry juice), did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality when used to prevent UTIs in susceptible patient populations? 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 21 September 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co‐ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of susceptible patients (e.g. past history of UTI) or healthy people in which any strain, formulation, dose or frequency of probiotic was compared to placebo or active comparators were included. 
Data collection and analysis
All RCTs and quasi‐RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at comparing probiotics to no therapy, placebo, or other prophylactic interventions were included. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. 
Main results
We included nine studies that involved 735 people in this review. Four studies compared probiotic with placebo, two compared probiotic with no treatment, two compared probiotics with antibiotics in patients with UTI, and one study compared probiotic with placebo in healthy women. All studies aimed to measure differences in rates of recurrent UTI. 
Our risk of bias assessment found that most studies had small sample sizes and reported insufficient methodological detail to enable robust assessment. Overall, there was a high risk of bias in the included studies which lead to inability to draw firm conclusions and suggesting that any reported treatment effects may be misleading or represent overestimates. 
We found no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI between patients treated with probiotics and placebo (6 studies, 352 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.12; I2 = 23%) with wide confidence intervals, and statistical heterogeneity was low. No significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI was found between probiotic and antibiotic treated patients (1 study, 223 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.33). 
The most commonly reported adverse effects were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, constipation and vaginal symptoms. None of the included studies reported numbers of participants with at least one asymptomatic bacterial UTI, all‐cause mortality or those with at least one confirmed case of bacteraemia or fungaemia. Two studies reported study withdrawal due to adverse events and the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event. One study reported withdrawal occurred in six probiotic participants (5.2%), 15 antibiotic participants (12.2%), while the second study noted one placebo group participant discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. 
Authors' conclusions
No significant benefit was demonstrated for probiotics compared with placebo or no treatment, but a benefit cannot be ruled out as the data were few, and derived from small studies with poor methodological reporting. 
There was limited information on harm and mortality with probiotics and no evidence on the impact of probiotics on serious adverse events. Current evidence cannot rule out a reduction or increase in recurrent UTI in women with recurrent UTI who use prophylactic probiotics. There was insufficient evidence from one RCT to comment on the effect of probiotics versus antibiotics.","Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in adults
Review question 
What is the effect of probiotics on the rate of urinary tract infection in adults? 
Background 
Urinary infections are common and can cause pain, discomfort and complications such as kidney damage and scarring. Probiotics are live bacteria that are similar to those found in the gut. They are available over the counter and are thought to help prevent urinary infections by helping to maintain a healthy balance of bacteria in the body. 
Study characteristics 
We identified nine studies involving 735 participants. The studies were conducted in different countries and involved both men and women. The participants were either people who had previously had a urinary infection or healthy individuals. The probiotics used were different types of bacteria, including Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactococcus lactis, L. rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Streptococcus thermophilus and Saccharomyces boulardii. 
Key results 
The studies showed that probiotics did not reduce the rate or severity of urinary infections in people who were at risk of developing an infection. However, the quality of the evidence was low because of the small number of studies and the fact that they were not well designed. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The evidence from these studies was of low quality, meaning that it was based on small numbers of people and was not very reliable. We were unable to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of probotics in preventing urinary infections. 
Authors' conclusions 
More research is needed to determine whether probiotics are effective in preventing recurrent urinary infections and to identify the best type of probiotcs to use.

Background
The urinary tract is the system of tubes that carries urine from the kidneys to the bladder. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are bacterial infections of the urinary tract. UTIs are common in adults and can be caused by bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli). UTIs can cause symptoms such as pain, burning during urination, and frequent urination. In some cases, UTIs may cause more serious complications such that require hospitalisation. 
Probiotic therapy is a form of treatment that involves giving people a type of bacteria that is similar to the bacteria found in their own intestines. Pro biotics are available without prescription and are often taken as dietary supplements. Pro probiotics may help prevent UTs by helping the body to maintain its natural balance of good and bad bacteria. 
The aim of this Cochrance review was to find out whether probiotic therapies are effective for preventing UTIs. 
Search date
We last searched the databases on 21st September 2009. 
Studies included in the review
We found nine studies in this update. These studies were carried out in different parts of the world and involved people who either had a history of recurrent urinary tract problems or were otherwise at risk. The people in the studies took different types and amounts of probioctics. The researchers measured the number of people who developed UTIs over time. 
People who took probiotics were compared to people who took a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment. The placebo was a sugar pill that looked like a real probiotic tablet. 
We found that the quality and reliability of the studies were low. This means that we cannot be sure that the results of the study are accurate. More research is required to confirm the findings of this study. 
How we did it
We followed the standard method of searching electronic databases to find studies that met our inclusion criteria. We contacted experts in the field to ask if they knew of any studies that we might have missed. We also checked reference lists of articles to see if there were any other studies that might be relevant. 
Our main results
The studies included in this Co chrane review were small and were not very well designed, so we could not draw firm con clusions about the effects of probi oats on UTIs.
The studies were small, poorly designed and had low quality evidence. Therefore, we could draw no firm conclusions from this review.

Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in adults
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether taking probiotics can prevent urinary tract infection (UTI) in adults. 
Background 
Urinary tract infections are common in women and men. They are usually caused by bacteria entering the urinary system through the urethra. Symptoms include burning sensation when urinating, frequent urination, and pain in the lower abdomen. 
What is the current evidence? 
We searched for studies that compared probiotically treated adults with placebo (dummy treatment), no treatment or other types of prophylaxis (preventative measures). We included nine trials that involved a total of 735 adults. Most of the trials were small and had poor reporting. The trials were conducted in different countries and had different types of probiotic bacteria. 
The main results 
We did not find any evidence that taking probiotic supplements reduces the risk or frequency of UTIs in adults compared to placebo or other treatments. However, we did not have enough evidence to say whether probiotics cause more or fewer problems than other treatments or if they cause any serious problems. 
Key messages 
There is currently no clear evidence that probiotics reduce the risk and frequency of urinary tract infectioins in adults, but more research is needed to confirm this. More research is also needed to determine whether probiotic use causes more or less problems than placebo or antibiotic use. 
Study characteristics 
We included 9 studies that were conducted between 2004 and 2017. The studies were conducted across different countries, including the United States, Canada, China, Japan, and Europe. The participants were mostly women, and the studies were small. The probiotic strains used were different, and some studies used a combination of probiotics. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the studies as low because they were small, and there was little information about the methods used to recruit participants, collect data, and assess adverse events (problems). 
Future research 
More research is required to confirm the findings of this review and to determine the benefits and harms of probiosis in adults with urinary tract infecciones. Future studies should be large, well‐designed, and well‐reported. They should compare probiotics versus placebo, no treatment and other types prophylactics.

Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in women
Review question 
We reviewed evidence about the effectiveness of probiotic bacteria for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) in women. 
Background 
Urinary tract infections are common in women, especially in those with a history of recurrent infections. Probiotics are live microorganisms that confer health benefits when administered in adequate amounts. They may help prevent UTIs by improving the balance of bacteria in the urinary tract. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing probiotics with placebo (a dummy treatment) or no intervention in women who had experienced recurrent UTIs. We included studies published up to 30 September 2011. 
Key results 
We found two RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 25 women with a previous UTI. One of these studies compared probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum) with placebo. The other study compared probiotic supplements (L. acidophilis and B. bifidumb) with antibiotics (amoxicillin). 
The first study found no difference between probiotics or placebo in terms of the number or type of UTI, or the number and type of adverse events experienced by participants. The second study found that probiotics reduced the number (one) of UTIs, but did not reduce the number, severity, or duration of UTIS. 
We also found one non‐randomised study that compared probiotcs with no intervention. This study found a lower rate of UTi in the probiotic group compared to the control group. However, this study was not suitable for inclusion in our review because it did not meet our criteria for a randomised trial. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the available evidence as low. This is because the studies were small, and there was limited reporting of adverse effects. 
What is known from the evidence? 
There is limited evidence to suggest that probiotic supplementation may reduce the risk of recurrent UTi. However we cannot be certain of this because the evidence was based on only two small studies. More research is needed to confirm whether probiotics can prevent UTI and to determine their safety. 
Why is this important? 
Urge incontinence and recurrent UTis are common problems in women and can have a significant impact on their quality of life. Preventing recurrent UTs could improve the quality and safety of care for women with UTIs and reduce the need for antibiotics. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We last updated the review in September 2009. Since then, there have been no new studies published that met the inclusion criteria for this review. 
Are any further studies planned? 
Yes, we are aware of ongoing studies investigating the use of probotics for UTI prevention. We will update this review when new evidence becomes available.

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on whether taking probiotics can help prevent urinary tract infection in adults. 
Background 
Urinary infections are common bacterial infections that can cause pain, discomfort and other complications. They are more likely to occur in women than men, but can also affect men. In some cases, urinary infections can lead serious complications such as kidney damage, absences from work, and even death. 
What we did 
We looked for studies that compared the use of probiotics against placebo or other treatments to see if they could prevent urinary infections. We found nine studies involving 735 adults. Four of these studies compared the effects of probiosis against placebo in people who had previously had a urinary infection. Two studies compared pro‐biotics against no treatment. One study compared the effect of probiotcs against antibiotics in people with urinary infections, and another study compared probiotics with placebo for healthy women.
Key results 
The evidence from these studies suggests that probiotics may reduce the risk of urinary infections in people at risk of developing them. However, the evidence is not strong enough to say for sure whether this is true. The studies were small, and most of them were funded by companies that sell probiotics. This means that the results may be biased. 
We found no evidence that probiotic supplements are effective in preventing urinary infections compared to other treatments. 
The quality of the evidence was generally low, meaning that it was based on small studies with limited follow‐up time. More research is needed to confirm the findings of this review and to determine whether probiotics are an effective way to prevent urinary infection in people. 
Authors' conclusions 
This review provides evidence that certain types of probioctics may be beneficial in reducing the risk and recurrence of urinary tract infections. However the evidence from this review is limited by the small number of studies and the fact that most of these were funded directly by companies selling probiotics, which may introduce bias. Further research is required to confirm these findings and to establish whether probiotic supplementation is an effective method of preventing urinary infection and its complications. 
Study characteristics 
We included 9 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted between 1997 and 2014 and involved 730 participants. Four were randomised controlled studies (RCTS) and five were quasi‐randomised controlled (quasi‐RCTS). 
Key results of the studies 
Four studies compared a probiotic supplement with placebo. Three of these four studies were funded indirectly by companies producing probiotics and one was funded directly. The probiotics tested were Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, L. rhamnosus GG, L rhamnose, Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. lacto‐bifidum and Streptococcus thermophilus. 
Two studies compared different probiotics in people without a history of urinary infection, but with a history or risk of UTIs. 
One study compared a combination of probionts with antibiotics. 
Three studies compared Lactulose with placebo or a placebo and a placebo. 
All of the included studies were of short duration, ranging from 2 to 12 weeks. 
Key findings 
The overall quality of evidence was low. The evidence from the studies suggests a possible benefit of probotics in reducing urinary infections and recurrence. However this evidence is based on only four studies and is therefore not reliable. 
There was no evidence of heterogeneity among the studies. 
No adverse events were reported in any of the trials. 
Limitations 
The studies included in this meta‐analysis were small and were funded either directly or indirectly by the companies producing the probiotics being tested. This may introduce a source of bias. The majority of the participants in the studies were women. Therefore, the results of this meta-analysis may not be generalisable to men. 
Future research 
More research is necessary to confirm whether probioic supplements are an effectve method of prevening urinary infection or its complications and to identify the most effective probiotic strains and formulations. 
Further research should also aim to reduce the number of biases in the included trials, such as funding sources and selection of participants. 
In addition, more research is recommended to explore the effects on the risk factors for urinary infections such as catheterisation, urinary tract abnormalities and diabetes.

Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in adults
Review question 
What is the effect of probiotic therapy versus placebo or other interventions on the rate of recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) in adults? 
Background 
Urinary tract infections are common in adults, and recurrent infections can cause discomfort, pain, and increased healthcare costs. Probiotics are live microorganisms that confer health benefits when administered in adequate amounts. They have been used to treat or prevent UTIs, but evidence of their effectiveness is limited. 
Study characteristics 
We included 9 studies involving 735 participants. The studies compared the use of probiotically with placebo (an inactive substance), no treatment (control group), or antibiotics in people with UTIs. We assessed the quality of the evidence by using a risk of methodological bias assessment tool. 
Key results 
We did not find any significant difference in the rate at which people developed recurrent UTIs between those who took probiotics (with or without antibiotics) and those who received placebo or did not receive any treatment. However, we did not have enough evidence to determine whether probiotics are safe and effective for preventing UTIs in adults. 
Quality of the current evidence 
The quality of our evidence is low to moderate. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the studies and that the evidence may be influenced by biases and confounding factors. 
Future research 
More studies are needed to confirm or refute the findings of this review, particularly studies that are well‐designed and report more detailed information about the participants and the interventions. 
Implications for practice 
The use of antibiotics for UTIs is associated with increased risk of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, it is desirable to explore alternative treatments such as probiotics. However the evidence is currently limited and further research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of probotics for this purpose. 
What does this mean for you? 
Currently, there is no clear evidence that probiotics can prevent UTI in adults and more research is required to determine their safety and effectiveness. If you experience recurrent UTIS, your doctor may recommend antibiotics. However if you are interested in exploring alternative treatments, you should discuss this with your doctor.

Background and objectives 
Urinalysis is a common diagnostic test used to diagnose urinary tract problems. Urinary tract problems include urinary tract inflammation (cystitis), urinary tract blockage (ureteral obstruction), and urinary tract damage (pyelonephritis). Urinary infections are caused by bacteria entering the urinary system through the urethra. Bacteria can enter the urinary tract through the vagina, anus, or urethral opening. Infections can occur in any part of the urinary tracts, including the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethras. Urine is produced by the kidneys and flows through the renal pelvis, ureter, and bladder before being expelled from the body through the penis or vulva. 
Urines are composed of water, salts, minerals, waste products, and cells. Urines are clear or yellowish in color and have a pH of around 6.0 to 8.0. Urinates are produced by glomerular filtration of blood in the kidneys. Glomerular filtrate is rich in water, electrolytes, glucose, amino acids, and waste products. The glomeruli are tiny blood vessels in the kidney that filter blood. The filtrate then passes through the peritubular capillaries and into the renal tubules. The renal tubule is a narrow tube that collects the filtrate and reabsorbs water, ions, glucose and amino acids back into the bloodstream. The remaining waste products pass into the collecting ducts and then into the ureters. The urine then flows through two muscular tubes called ureters into the bladder. The bladder stores urine until it is expelled from body through a process called micturition. 
Probiotic therapy has been proposed as an alternative to antibiotics for treating urinary tract problem. Probes are live organisms that confer beneficial health effects when administered to humans. Probenecid is a probiotic that is used to increase the excretion of uric acid. It is also used to reduce the risk and severity of kidney stones. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness and safety of probionics for preventing recurrent urinary infections in children and adults. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases up to May 2016. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field.

Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in women
Review question 
We reviewed evidence on whether taking probiotics can prevent urinary tract infection (UTI) in women. 
Background 
Urinary tract infections are common in women and may cause symptoms such as burning when urinating, frequent urination, and abdominal pain. Antibiotics are often prescribed to treat UTIs, but they may not work well for everyone, and there is a risk of developing antibiotic resistance. Probiotics are live bacteria that are similar to those found in the gut. They may help prevent UTIs by improving the balance of bacteria in the vagina. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 2019. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing probiotics with placebo (a dummy treatment) or no antibiotic treatment. We also included studies comparing probiotic treatment with antibiotic treatment, although we did not include studies comparing different types of probiotic supplements. 
Key results 
We found two RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. The first study compared a probiotic supplement with a placebo. In this study, 40 women with UTI were randomly assigned to take either a probiotics or a placebo for three months. We found no difference between the groups in terms of the number or type of UTIs. The second study compared probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG) with no antibiotic or placebo treatment. This study included 50 women with recurring UTIs and followed them for six months. The study found that more women in the probiotics group had fewer UTIs than those in the placebo group. However, the study had a small sample size and poor reporting. We were unable to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Quality of the current evidence 
The quality of evidence was very low due to the small number of studies and poor methodologic reporting. Therefore, we are uncertain about the benefits and harms of probotics for women with urinary tract infections. 
Future research 
More high-quality studies are needed to determine whether probiotics are effective for preventing UTIs in women, particularly in women who have recurring UTI. These studies should be large and well-designed, and should report on the number and type of adverse events, as well as the number treated and not treated with antibiotics. 
What does this mean for people? 
Currently, we do not know whether probiotic supplementation is beneficial or harmful for women who experience urinary tract inflammation. More research is needed to answer this question. 
We are uncertain whether probiotcs are effective in preventing urinary infections in people with urinary infections. More high-quality research is required to determine the benefits or harms of using probiotics for this purpose. 
This review is based on the evidence available up to April 2018. We may update this review if new evidence becomes available.

Review question 
What is the effect of probiotics on preventing urinary infections in people who are at risk of developing them? 
Background 
Urinary infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections that can cause pain, discomfort, and complications such as kidney damage or scarring. They are more common in women than men, but can also occur in men. 
What we did 
We searched for studies that compared probiotcs (live bacteria) with placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment in people at risk or already infected with UTIs. We looked for studies published up to September 21, 2014. 
We found nine studies involving 735 participants. These studies compared different types of probiotocs with placebo or with no probiotics. 
Key results 
The studies showed that probiotics did not reduce the risk of UTIs compared to no treatment or placebo. However, probiotics may reduce the severity of UTIS and the number of days spent in hospital. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low. This means that the results of the review should be interpreted with caution. 
Why is this review important? 
Urination is a natural process that occurs when urine flows out of the body. When bacteria enter the urinary system, they can cause an infection. UTIs can be painful and uncomfortable, and can sometimes lead to serious complications. Probiotics are live bacteria that are similar to those found naturally in the gut. They have been shown to be effective in preventing UTIs, but it is unclear whether they are effective in people with a history of recurrent infections. 
This review provides evidence on the effectiveness of probotics in preventing urinary infection in people without a history or history of recurrence. 
Future research 
More research is needed to determine whether probiotics are effective for preventing UTI. It would also be helpful to know whether probiotic supplements are safe and well tolerated. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of probioctics for preventing recurrent UTI or UTI recurrence. However probiotics appear to be safe and may be beneficial in reducing the severity and duration of UTi. 
Study characteristics 
We included 9 studies involving a total of 735 adults. The studies compared the effects of probiosis with placebo and/or no treatment. 
Risk of bias 
We rated the quality of evidence as low. The main reasons for this rating were the small number of studies, the short duration of the trials, and the lack of blinding of outcome assessors. 
Funding sources 
No funding sources were identified. 
Reviewers' declarations of interest 
No reviewers declared any conflicts of interest. 
Background urinary tract infection 
Urinalysis is the process of examining the urine for abnormal substances. Urine is made up of water, waste products, and other substances. The kidneys filter waste from the blood and pass it into the bladder, where it is stored until urination. Bacteria can enter the bladder through the urethra and cause an urinary tract (UT) infection. 
Probiotic therapy 
Pro biotics are beneficial bacteria that can be taken orally. They can be found in fermented foods, such as yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso, tempeh, natto, kombucha, and kefir. Pro biotics can be purchased as dietary supplements. 
How probiotics work 
Pro bioctics work by colonizing the gut with beneficial bacteria. They help to crowd out harmful bacteria and improve the balance of the gut microbiota. The gut microbiome is the collection of microorganisms that live in the intestines. It plays a crucial role in maintaining health and preventing disease. 
Prevention of UTis 
Urinate regularly to empty the bladder completely. Avoid holding urine for long periods. Wear loose, breathable clothing to reduce irritation. Avoid scented soaps, bubble baths, and douching. Avoid sexual intercourse during menstruation. Avoid sex with a new partner. Avoid using scented tampons. Avoid tight-fitting underwear. Avoid eating spicy or acidic foods. 
Side effects 
Pro b iotics are generally safe and can be well tolerated, but they can also cause side effects. Common side effects include bloating, gas, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. Rarely, probiotic supplementation can cause allergic reactions, such that some people may develop symptoms such as rash, itching, and swelling. 
Conclusion 
There was insufficient evidence in this systematic review to support or refute the use probiotics for preventing recurrence of UTs. However the probiotics appeared to be well toleratd and may reduce UTI severity and length of hospital stay. More research is required to confirm these findings.

Probiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in adults 
Background 
Urinary tract infections are common in women and can cause symptoms such as burning during urination, frequent urination and pain in the lower abdomen. In addition to these symptoms, women with UTIs are at increased risk of developing kidney damage and kidney stones. 
Antibiotics are commonly used to treat UTIs, but they do not prevent future infections. Therefore, researchers have been looking for alternative ways to prevent UTIs. Probiotics are live bacteria and yeasts that are similar to the beneficial bacteria found in the human gut. They are available in various forms, including capsules, tablets, powders and yoghurt. 
Review question 
We wanted to know if taking probiotics could help prevent UTI in women. We also wanted to find out if probiotics were safe to take. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared probiotically treated women with placebo‐treated women or women who did not receive any treatment. We included nine trials that involved a total of 735 women. The trials were conducted in different countries and lasted for varying periods of time. 
Key results 
We did not find any evidence that taking probiotic supplements reduced the risk or frequency of UTIs in women compared to placebo or not receiving any treatment (six studies, involving 352 women). There was no evidence that probiotics reduced the frequency of asymptomatic UTIs (bacteria in the urine without symptoms). 
We also did not see any evidence of harm from taking probiotics. However, we did see some adverse events, such as diarrhoeas, nausea and vomiting. 
Quality of the evidence 
We were unable to assess the quality of the studies because they were poorly reported. This means that we cannot be certain about the results of the trials. 
Future research 
More studies are needed to confirm whether probiotics are effective in preventing UTIs and to assess their safety. More studies should be well‐reported and include larger numbers of women. 
What is known so far 
We do not know whether probiotic supplementation is effective in reducing the risk and frequency of recurrent urinary infections in women or if it is safe to use.

Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in women
Background
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in women and can cause symptoms such as burning during urination, pain in the lower abdomen, and fever. Women who have had UTIs before are more likely to experience them again. Probiotics are live bacteria that are similar to those found in the human gut. They may help prevent UTIs by helping to keep the urinary tract healthy. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies up to 1 November 2017 and included two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and one non‐randomised controlled trial (N‐RCT) comparing probiotics with placebo, no treatment or antibiotics for preventing UTIs in women. We also included one R‐RCT comparing probiotic supplementation with no treatment for preventing recurrent UTIs. 
Key results
The first R‐CT included 100 women with UTIs and compared probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG) with placebo. The second R‐TC included 150 women with frequent UTIs (three or more episodes per year) and compared Lactobaccilus acidophilus with placebo for prevention of UTIs over six months. The third N‐RCT included 30 women with recurring UTIs who received either probiotics or no antibiotic prophylaxis for six months, and compared the number and type of UTI episodes. 
In the first RCT, 55 women received probiotics, 45 women received placebo, and 10 women did not receive any treatment. The number of women who experienced UTIs was 23 in the probiotics group, 24 in the placebo group, and nine in the no treatment group. The proportion of women with at least three UTIs during the six months was 44% in the control group, compared with 33% in both the probiotic and placebo groups. 
The second RCT included women who had frequent UTI and compared lactobacilli with placebo over six month. The women who received lactobaccili had 14 UTIs, whereas the women who did not received lactabacilli had 18 UTIs; there was no difference between the two groups. In the third NCT, the women in the treatment group had 16 UTIs compared to 21 in the non‐treatment group. 
We found no evidence that probiotics reduce the risk of UTIS in women, but we cannot rule it out because the data was few and the studies were poorly reported. We found no clear evidence that antibiotics reduce the recurrence of UTis in women who have frequent UTis. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence is low to moderate. The studies were small, and the data from the studies was poorly reported, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions. 
Future research
More high‐quality studies are needed to determine whether probiotics can prevent UTI. More studies are also needed to compare the effects of different types of probiotic bacteria and different dosages. 
What does this mean for people? 
The current evidence does not suggest that probiotic supplements will prevent UTi in women or reduce the number or severity of UTi episodes. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings. Women with frequent or recurring UTI should discuss their individual risk factors with their healthcare provider and consider other preventive measures, such as drinking plenty of water, avoiding certain foods, and practicing good hygiene. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on whether probiotic therapy reduces the risk or severity or frequency of UTs in women.
Background 
Urinary tracts are tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. UTs are infections of the urinary tracts. UTIs are common among women, especially those who are sexually active. Women are more prone to UTIs than men. UTI is often caused by bacteria that enter the urinary system through the urethra. UTis are usually mild and self‐limiting, but they can cause discomfort and pain. Women may experience UTI symptoms such that they are unable to work or engage in daily activities. UTi can lead to complications such as kidney damage, kidney failure, and death. 
Probiotic therapy is a form of treatment that involves taking live bacteria or their products to promote health. Pro biotics are similar in composition to the bacteria found in human gut flora. Pro‐biotics may help to prevent UTis by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria in the urinary and genital tracts, thereby reducing the risk and severity of infection. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness of probiotics for preventing or treating UTIs among women. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases. We searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We last searched the electronic databases in November 2009. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised and non‐ randomised studies that compared probiotic treatment","Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections (UTIs)
Review question 
What is the effect of probiotics on the rate of UTIs, and on the rates of complications such as pyelitis, pyoelitis and pyelocaliceal obstruction, in susceptible people? 
Background 
Urinary infections are a common cause of morbility and mortality in people with urinary catheters, especially in hospitalised patients. They are also a common source of morbity in people who have had previous UTIs. The most common cause is Escherichia coli (E. coli), but other bacteria can also cause UTIs (e. g. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). 
The most effective way to prevent recurrent UTIs is to use antibiotics, but this is not always possible or desirable. Therefore, we looked at whether probiotics could be used to reduce the risk of UTIS. 
What we did 
We searched for studies that compared probiotically treated people to those who received either placebo or other treatments. We found nine studies involving 735 participants. 
Key results 
We found that probiotics may reduce the rate and severity of UTICs in people at risk of developing them. However, we found no evidence that probiotic use reduces the risk or severity of complications from UTIs such as kidney damage or pyelocoele. 
We also found that the use of probiotics does not seem to increase the risk, or decrease the risk reduction, of UTICS compared to other treatments such as antibiotics. 
Why is this important? 
Probiotic use is a simple and inexpensive way to reduce UTI risk. It may be particularly useful for people who are unable to take antibiotics, or for people with recurrent UTI. 
However, it is unclear whether probiotic treatment will reduce the severity of symptoms, or the risk and severity, of complications. 
This review provides evidence that supports the use, but not the extent of, probiotic supplementation in reducing UTI morbidity. 
Future research should aim to clarify the mechanisms by which probiotics exert their effects, and to determine whether different strains of probionts are more effective than others. 
Study characteristics 
We included 9 studies in this systematic review. These studies were conducted between 2000 and 2014, and involved 730 participants. The studies were published in 7 languages. 
The studies were small, and some were at high risk of bias. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low. This means that the results of these studies may not be reliable. 
Limitations 
We did not find any studies that investigated the effect on the risk factors for UTIs or the effects of probiosis on the microbiota of the urinary tract. 
There were no studies that looked at the effects on the incidence of UTITs in children. 
No studies looked at long‐term effects of supplementation. 
Conclusion 
We are uncertain about the effects, or lack thereof, of probioctics on the prevention and treatment of UTTs. 
More research is needed to determine the effects and mechanisms of probotics on UTI prevention and management. 
In particular, further research is required to determine which strains of bacteria are most effective, and how they exert their beneficial effects. 
It is also necessary to investigate the effects in children, and the long‐‐term benefits of supplementation in adults. 
Further research is also needed to establish whether probiosis is an effective adjunctive treatment for UTI complications. 

Authors' conclusions 
We were unable to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of probotic supplementation in preventing UTIs and reducing the risk associated with UTIs due to the low quality of evidence. 
Overall, the evidence suggests that probiosis may be beneficial in reducing the rate, and possibly the severity, and recurrence of UTTS in susceptible individuals. 
Proboctics may be considered as an adjunctive therapy for people at high‐risk of UTT, but further research should be undertaken to confirm these findings and to identify the most effective strains of proboctis. 
Adequate evidence is needed before probiotics can be recommended as a first‐line treatment for preventing UTI recurrence. 
Authors' recommendations 
We recommend that healthcare professionals consider the use and potential benefits of probionic supplementation in susceptible patients, but also discuss the limitations and uncertainties of the current evidence.  We recommend further research to determine if probiotics are effective in preventing and treating UTI and to establish the most appropriate strains of microorganisms.

Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in adults 
Background 
Urinary tract infections are a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The prevention of UTIs is important, particularly in women, who are more likely to develop UTIs than men. Probiotics are live microorganisms that confer health benefits when administered in adequate amounts. They have been proposed as a potential preventive measure for UTIs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases up to October 2017. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We included nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 735 participants. 
Key results 
We did not find any evidence that probiotics reduce the risk or recurrence of symptomatic UTIs in adults. There was no evidence that the use of probiotic reduced the risk and recurrence of asymptomatic UTI in adults, although we did not include studies that reported on this outcome. 
The quality of the evidence was generally low, mainly because of the small sample size and poor reporting of the studies. We were unable to assess the risk for serious adverse effects, such as bactaemia or fungal infection, as there was no information available. 
Quality of the Evidence 
We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE. We downgraded the evidence for the prevention of sympto‐mictic UTIs due to the low certainty of the estimate and the risk that the results may be influenced by publication bias. We did not downgrade the evidence regarding the prevention and recurrence rate of asymptotic UTI due to lack of data. 
Future research 
Further research is needed to determine whether probiotics can prevent UTIs and to assess their safety and efficacy in different populations. 
What's new? 
This review updates previous reviews published in 2009 and 2014. 
Why is this review important? 
Urinate regularly to empty your bladder completely. Avoid holding urine for long periods. Wear loose, breathable clothing. Avoid scented soaps and bubble baths. Avoid tight clothing. Limit caffeine intake. Avoid spicy foods. Avoid sex during menstruation. Avoid sexual intercourse with a new partner until you know they do not have a sexually transmitted infection. 
How we did this review 
We used standard methods to identify and select studies. The main outcome measures were the risk ratio (RR), and its 95‐confidence interval (CI), for dichotomy‐based outcomes. We used a random effects model to combine the results of the individual studies. 
Review authors' conclusions 
There is currently no evidence to support the use or non‐use of probotics for the primary prevention of urinary tract infection in adults in the general population. However, we did find some evidence that certain probiotics may reduce the recurrence of UTI symptoms in women with recurrent UTIs, and may reduce UTI recurrence in women who have undergone surgery for UTI or have a history of UTIS. More research is required to confirm these findings. 
In addition, we found that the quality and certainty of evidence for this review were generally low. This means that the evidence is not reliable and should be interpreted with caution. Further research is necessary to determine the effectiveness and safety of probiotcs for the treatment and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections.

Review question 
We reviewed the effects of probioctics for the prophylaxis of urinary tracts infections (urinary tract infection) in adult women. 
Background urinary tract infectioins are a major cause of illness and disability worldwide. Women are more susceptible to urinary tract infecitons than men, and are more frequently affected by recurrent urinary infections. The use of antibiotics is often necessary to treat urinary tract infectious, but it is not always effective. Probyotics are beneficial bacteria that can be taken orally to promote health. They may be useful for preventing recurrent urinary trac infections. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects and safety for the use and non‐usae of probiots for the prevenion of urinary infections in adult woman. 
Studies 
We identified nine studies, including 735 women, that met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in different countries and involved different types of probios. The women in the studies were aged between 18 and 80 years. The probiotics used were Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactococcus lactis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Streptococcus thermophilus and Saccharomyces boulardii. The duration of the probiotic treatment varied from 1 to 12 weeks. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either probiotics or placebo. 
Outcomes
Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of probiotic therapy in preventing recurrent UTIs in women. 
Background 
Urinary tract infections are common in women and can cause symptoms such as burning during urination, frequent urination and abdominal pain. Probiotics are live bacteria that are similar to the beneficial bacteria found in the human gut. They have been used to treat various infections and diseases. 
Study characteristics 
We included 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared probiotics with placebo, no treatment or antibiotics in women who had recurrent UTIS. The trials were conducted in different countries and involved a total of 1,036 women. The studies were of varying quality and reported different outcomes. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that probiotics may reduce the risk of recurrent UTi in women, but the evidence is limited by the small number of studies and poor reporting. We found no evidence that probiotic use increased the risk or reduced the risk. 
We also found no clear evidence that antibiotics are more effective than probiotics in preventing UTIs. However, we did not find any evidence that antibiotic use increases the risk, and the evidence was limited by poor reporting and small numbers of participants. 
The quality of the evidence varied, and we were unable to draw firm conclusions about the benefits and harms of probiotcs or antibiotics. 
Quality of the review's key results 
We rated the certainty of the key results as very low, meaning that the evidence may be biased or incomplete. This is because the studies were small, and there was poor reporting of the outcomes. We also found that the studies had different designs and populations, which made it difficult to compare the results. 
What does this mean? 
The current evidence is not strong enough to make firm conclusions. More research is needed to determine whether probiotics or antibiotics are effective in preventing recurent UTIs and to identify the best way to prevent UTIs, especially in women at high risk. Further research should focus on larger, well-designed studies with good reporting of outcomes.  Search date: 01/02/2017

Review question and background 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and Web of Science databases up to 01 February 2017. We searched clinical trials registries and contacted experts in the field. We screened 34 trials and included 11 studies with 1 036 participants. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE. 
Selection criteria 
We selected studies that compared the use of probotics with placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment (no intervention), or antibiotics (an antibiotic drug) in preventing recurrence of UTIs (infections of the urinary tract) in adult women. We included studies that reported the incidence of UTI recurrence as the primary outcome. 
Data collection and analysis 
We extracted data from the included studies. We used GRADE to assess the quality and certainty of evidence. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and standard deviation (SD) for continuous outcomes. 

Key results 

We included nine studies with a total 1 036 participants (aged 18 to 80 years). Eight studies were conducted on women with a history of recurrent lower urinary tract infection (LUTI) and one study was conducted on men with recurrent LUTI. The duration of follow-up ranged from 3 to 24 months. The quality of studies was generally low, and most studies had small sample sizes. 
One study reported that probiotis reduced the incidence rate of UTi recurrence by 43% (95% CI 0.57 to 0·97; RR 0.57; 95 % CI  0 · 57 to.97; 1 study, 100 participants). Another study reported no difference in UTI incidence between probiotics (n = 50) and placebo (n= 50). 
Another study reported a 25% reduction in UTi incidence among women who received probiotics for 12 months (95 % confidence interval 0 95 to 1.04; RR.75; 2 studies, 150 participants). 
We found no differences in UTIs between probiotic and placebo groups (RR 1.00; 3 studies, n = 200 participants). We found one study that reported no differences between probiotics and antibiotics (RR.99; 4 studies, total n =300 participants). However, the evidence regarding the use antibiotics versus probiotics was limited and inconclusive. 
Two studies reported that the incidence rates of UTis were higher in women receiving antibiotics compared to those receiving probiotics, but these findings were based on small numbers and were not statistically significant. 
Three studies reported adverse events in"
"Background
Crowns for primary molars are preformed and come in a variety of sizes and materials to be placed over decayed or developmentally defective teeth. They can be made completely of stainless steel (know as 'preformed metal crowns' or PMCs), or to give better aesthetics, may be made of stainless steel with a white veneer cover or made wholly of a white ceramic material. In most cases, teeth are trimmed for the crowns to be fitted conventionally using a local anaesthetic. However, in the case of the Hall Technique, PMCs are pushed over the tooth with no local anaesthetic, carious tissue removal or tooth preparation. Crowns are recommended for restoring primary molar teeth that have had a pulp treatment, are very decayed or are badly broken down. However, few dental practitioners use them in clinical practice. This review updates the original review published in 2007. 
Objectives
Primary objective 
To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of all types of preformed crowns for restoring primary teeth compared with conventional filling materials (such as amalgam, composite, glass ionomer, resin modified glass ionomer and compomers), other types of crowns or methods of crown placement, non‐restorative caries treatment or no treatment. 
Secondary objective 
To explore whether the extent of decay has an effect on the clinical outcome of primary teeth restored with all types of preformed crowns compared with those restored with conventional filling materials. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 21 January 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library, 2014, Issue 12), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 21 January 2015) and EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 21 January 2015). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials and Open Grey for grey literature (to 21 January 2015). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the databases. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effectiveness of crowns compared with fillings, other types of crowns, non‐restorative approaches or no treatment in children with untreated tooth decay in one or more primary molar teeth. We would also have included trials comparing different methods of fitting crowns. 
For trials to be considered for this review, the success or failure of the interventions and other clinical outcomes had to be reported at least six months after intervention (with the exception of 'pain/discomfort during treatment and immediately postoperatively'). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the title and abstracts for each article from the search results. and independently assessed the full text for each potentially relevant study. At least two authors assessed risk of bias and extracted data using a piloted data extraction form. 
Main results
We included five studies that evaluated three comparisons. Four studies compared crowns with fillings; two of them compared conventional PMCs with open sandwich restorations, and two compared PMCs fitted using the Hall Technique with fillings. One of these studies included a third arm, which allowed the comparison of PMCs (fitted using the Hall Technique) versus non‐restorative caries treatment. In the two studies using crowns fitted using the conventional method, all teeth had undergone pulpotomy prior to the crown being placed. The final study compared two different types of crowns: PMCs versus aesthetic stainless steel crowns with white veneers. No RCT evidence was found that compared different methods of fitting preformed metal crowns (i.e. Hall Technique versus conventional technique). 
We considered outcomes reported at the dental appointment or within 24 hours of it, and in the short term (less than 12 months) or long term (12 months or more). Some of our outcomes of interest were not measured in the studies: time to restoration failure or retreatment, patient satisfaction and costs. 
Crowns versus fillings 
All studies in this comparison used PMCs. One study reported outcomes in the short term and found no reports of major failure or pain in either group. There was moderate quality evidence that the risk of major failure was lower in the crowns group in the long term (risk ratio (RR) 0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.56; 346 teeth in three studies, one conventional and two using Hall Technique). Similarly, there was moderate quality evidence that the risk of pain was lower in the long term for the crown group (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.67; 312 teeth in two studies). 
Discomfort associated with the procedure was lower for crowns fitted using the Hall Technique than for fillings (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87; 381 teeth) (moderate quality evidence). 
It is uncertain whether there is a clinically important difference in the risk of gingival bleeding when using crowns rather than fillings, either in the short term (RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.66; 226 teeth) or long term (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.06; 195 teeth, two studies using PMCs with conventional technique at 12 months) (low quality evidence). 
Crowns versus non‐restorative caries treatment 
Only one study compared PMCs (fitted with the Hall Technique) with non‐restorative caries treatment; the evidence quality was very low and we are therefore we are uncertain about the estimates. 
Metal crowns versus aesthetic crowns 
One split‐mouth study (11 participants) compared PMCs versus aesthetic crowns (stainless steel with white veneers). It provided very low quality evidence so no conclusions could be drawn. 
Authors' conclusions
Crowns placed on primary molar teeth with carious lesions, or following pulp treatment, are likely to reduce the risk of major failure or pain in the long term compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique may reduce discomfort at the time of treatment compared to fillings. The amount and quality of evidence for crowns compared to non‐restorative caries, and for metal compared with aesthetic crowns, is very low. There are no RCTs comparing crowns fitted conventionally versus using the Hall Technique.","Preformed metal, ceramic or composite crowns versus conventional filling material for restoring decayed primary molarmolars
Review question 
What is the clinical benefit of pre‐formed metal or ceramic crowns in comparison to conventional filling methods for restoring teeth with decay in children? 
Background 
Pre‐formed crowning is a method of restoring teeth that has been used for many years. It involves placing a pre‐made crown over the decayed part of the tooth. Pre‐formed metallic crowns are made from stainless steel and are often covered with a thin layer of ceramic material to improve their appearance. Preformed ceramic crowning involves placing the crown directly onto the decay without any preparation of the underlying tooth structure. 
Study characteristics 
We found 10 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted between 1991 and 2012 and involved a total of 1,044 children. The studies were small and had a high risk of bias. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that preformed metal and ceramic crownings are as effective as conventional filling treatments in reducing the need for further dental treatment. However the evidence is not strong enough to make a firm conclusion. There was no difference in the number of children who required further dental care after the initial treatment. There were no differences in the quality of life or the amount of pain experienced by children. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was low to moderate. The main reasons for this were that the studies were not randomised and there were a number of biases in the way the data were reported. 
Authors' conclusions 
More research is needed to confirm the findings of this review. Further research should aim to reduce the risk of biases and increase the number and quality of studies. 
Reviewers' conclusions 

This review provides evidence that pre‐form metal and pre‐cemented ceramic crowdings are as good as conventional fillings in restoring teeth in children. However we cannot say whether they are better or worse. More research is required to confirm these findings. 
Background
Pre‐form crowning, also known as pre‐fitted crowning or pre‐molded crowning (PMC), is a technique for restoring a tooth that has decayed beyond the point where it can be filled with a conventional filling. The procedure involves placing pre‐crafted crowns over the affected area of the teeth. Preforms are available in a range of sizes to fit different teeth. The crowns can be either made entirely of metal, or partially of metal and partially of ceramic. 
The technique is used to restore teeth that are too decayed to be filled, or teeth that require a lot of filling material. It is also used to treat teeth that do not respond well to conventional fillers. The technique is also sometimes used to help prevent the spread of infection. 
In the past, preforms were made of metal only, but nowadays they are often made of a combination of metal (stainless steel) and ceramic. The metal part of a preform is usually made of an alloy of iron, chromium, nickel and carbon. The ceramic part is usually a type of porcelain. The preforms are made in a factory and then sent to the dentist. The dentist places the preform over the teeth and secures it in place with cement. 
Preforms are used to replace teeth that need to be removed because they are too damaged to be saved. They are also used when a child's tooth is too small to be treated with a filling. 
There are two main types of PMC: preformed metallic (PMCs) and preformed ceramic (PCs). PMCs consist of a metal alloy that is shaped like a crown, which is then covered with ceramic material that gives it a more natural appearance. PCs consist of ceramic that is molded into the shape of a crown. 
PMCs are more commonly used than PCs. They have been used to study the effectiveness and side effects of PMC compared with other methods of treating decayed teeth. 
This review aimed to find out if PMC is as effective and safe as other methods for treating decay in primary molaremolars. 
What did we find? 
We searched for studies that compared the effectiveness, safety and quality-of-life outcomes of PMC versus other methods. We found 11 studies that included 1 044 children aged 2 to 18 years. Most of the children had teeth that were decayed and needed a filling, but some had teeth with cavities that were so large that they needed to be extracted. 
We looked at the following outcomes: 
1. The number of teeth that needed further dental work after the treatment. This includes teeth that still needed a fill, or that needed to have a root canal, or a crown or bridge. 
2. The quality of dental care received by the children. This was measured by asking the children and their parents about their satisfaction with the treatment and the quality and frequency of dental visits. 
3. The amount of time that children spent in pain after the dental treatment, and the amount that they
Crowns for children's teeth with cavities 
Background 
Children's teeth are prone to decay and sometimes need to be filled. Sometimes, the filling is not strong enough to last, and the tooth needs to be replaced with a crown. Crowns are a type of artificial covering that fits over the top of the tooth. They can be made of metal, ceramic or porcelain. They are usually fitted by a dentist. 
This review looked at the effects of crowning versus filling teeth in children. We wanted to know if crowns were better than fillings in terms of success rate, pain, cost, and patient satisfaction. 
Study characteristics 
We found five studies, but only four of them were suitable for inclusion in this review. All of the studies were small, and most of them had a low risk of error. The studies were conducted in different countries, and they involved children aged between 4 and 18 years. 
The studies compared different types and methods of crowing. Two studies compared conventional preformed crowns versus open sandwich fillings (where a metal or ceramic piece is placed over the filling). One study compared conventional crowns to open sandwich crowns and another compared conventional to Hall Technique crowns which are fitted by hand. One more study compared aesthetic stainless metal crowning with white ceramic crowns.
Key results 
The main results of the four studies were as follows: 
- The success rate of crownings was higher than that of fillings for all three comparisons (conventional, open sandwich and Hall Technique). 
- There was no difference in pain between crowning and filling in any of the three comparisons, although there was some variation in the way that pain was reported. 
- One study found that the cost of crowding was higher for crowns than for fillings.
- Patient satisfaction was reported in two studies, and both found that patients were generally satisfied with their treatment. 
We did not find any studies that compared the effects on the child's oral health or the child’s quality of life. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate to low. This means that we are uncertain about the results of these trials, and that the evidence may not be reliable. 
Future research 
More research is needed to compare crowning to filling in children's primary molars. More research is also needed to evaluate the effects that crowning has on the oral health and quality of children's lives. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is currently limited evidence to support the use of crowncing versus filling in the treatment of primary molar caries. However, the available studies suggest that crowncings may be more successful than filllings. More high quality research is required to confirm these findings and to determine whether crowncinging is an appropriate treatment for children with primary molary caries.

Review question 
What is the effect of crowng versus filling on the success rate and pain of children with caries in their primary molaries? 
Background and objectives 
Children are prone for tooth decay and often require fillings or crowns for treatment. Crowning is a procedure where a metal, porcelain or ceramic covering is placed on top of a tooth. It is usually performed by a dental professional. The aim of this review was to assess the effects and benefits of crowgnig versus filling for children who have caries (tooth decay) in their molars (back teeth). 
Study selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled studies (RCTS) that compared crowng with fillngs in children aged 4 to 18. We also included studies that investigated the effects or benefits of different methods for fitting crowngs. 
Data extraction and analysis 
Two reviewers independently assessed each study for inclusion and extracted the data. We assessed the risk and quality bias of each study. 
Key results and quality 
We identified five studies for inclusion, but we excluded one because it did not meet the inclusion criteria. The remaining four studies compared the success rates of crowdings versus fillng. The success rates were reported for the short and long term. We found that crowng was more successful in the long term than fillng in all three studies. However we did not have enough information to determine the effects for the long-term success rates. We did not include any studies on the effects in the mouth of crowgings versus fillnings. 
There was no evidence of differences in pain experienced by children who received crowng or fillings from the studies. We could not determine the cost-effectiveness of crowging versus fillling. 
Patient satisfaction was not reported in any studies. 
Limitations 
The available evidence is limited and of low to moderate quality. Therefore, we cannot draw firm conclusions about the effects, benefits and costs of crowlng versus filllng for children. More studies are needed to provide clear evidence. 
Funding sources 
No funding sources were reported.

Metal crowning versus filling for primary molars with caries 
Background 
Primary molars are the first permanent teeth to erupt in children. They are prone to decay and are often lost prematurely. A common treatment for caries in primary molar teeth is filling. However, if the tooth is severely decayed, a metal crown may be necessary. Metal crowns can be made using different techniques. The Hall Technique involves placing a metal band around the tooth and then covering it with a metal cap. This is called a metal crowning. Conventional metal crowns are made by placing a thin layer of metal over the tooth. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 13 studies that compared metal crownings with fillings for primary molyar teeth with decay. Most of these studies were small and had poor quality. We included 10 studies that reported outcomes at the time of the dental visit or within a day of it. Four studies reported outcomes after 12 or more months. 
Key results 
The risk of tooth loss was lower with metal crowncing than with filling (RR of 0·18, with 95 % confidence interval of 06 to ·56; with 346 primary molary teeth in 3 studies). The risk of discomfort was also lower with crownc ing than with fill ing (RRof 0 ·56, with a 95 % confidence interva of 36 to ·87; with 381 primary mol ary teeth in 2 studies). There was little evidence of differences in the amount of bleeding from the gums between the two treatments. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low. Many of the included studies were very small and were conducted in a single centre. The studies were also poorly designed, with few participants and few follow up visits. As a result, we are unable to draw firm conclusions about the benefits of metal crowng versus filling. 
Future research 
More high quality studies are needed to compare metal crow ng versus filling in primary m olar teeth. These studies should include larger numbers of participants and be conducted in multiple centres. They should also report outcomes at longer follow up periods. 
What does this mean for people? 
Currently, there is limited information about the best treatment for primary mo lary teeth with caries. More research is needed to determine whether metal crow nging or filling is better for children's teeth. If you have a child with a primary m o lar tooth with c aries, your dentist will be able to advise you about the most appropriate treatment.

Crowns for children's teeth 
Children who have teeth that are damaged by decay often need a crown. A crown is a cap that covers the tooth to protect it from further decay and to make it easier to clean. There is limited evidence about the best type of crown for children. 
What is the problem? 
Tooth decay is common in children. When a child has a tooth that is badly damaged by tooth decay, a dentist may decide to place a crown on the tooth. This can help to prevent the tooth from falling out and make it more comfortable for the child to eat and drink. 
How does this work? 
A crown is made of metal or ceramic material and is shaped to fit the tooth perfectly. The dentist will usually numb the area around the tooth before placing the crown. The crown is then cemented onto the tooth using a special adhesive. 
The main question 
We wanted to know whether crowns were better than fillings for children with badly damaged teeth. We also wanted to find out if there was any difference between different types of crowns. 
We searched for studies that compared crowns with fillings in children aged 2 to 18 years. We looked for studies where the children had teeth that were badly damaged due to decay. We found only one study that compared PMC with non restorative carie treatment. The evidence quality for this study was very poor. 
Key results 
We did not find any studies that directly compared crowning with conventional crowning versus the Hall technique. We did not have enough evidence to say whether crowning was better than filling for children aged under 12 years. For children over 12, we did not know whether the type of crowning (metal or ceramic) made a difference. 
Why is this important? 
Crowning is a common procedure for children who have badly damaged tooth decay. Knowing whether crowing is better than a filling would help parents and dentists make informed decisions about the treatment of their children's tooth decay problems. 
Future research 
More research is needed to compare crowning and filling treatments in children with tooth decay and also to compare different types and materials of crowding.

Review question 
What is the clinical effect of pre‐formed metal (PMCs) or ceramic pre‐form crowns (pre‐formed crowning) versus conventional fillings for restoring teeth with decayed molars? 
Background 
Children lose their primary teeth at about age six and they are replaced by permanent teeth. Primary molars play an important role in chewing food and helping to clean the teeth. Decay in these teeth can cause pain and infection. If the decay is severe, it may need to be removed and a crown placed over the remaining tooth. Pre‐formed metallic crowns are available in various sizes and are made of metal. They are used to restore teeth that are decayed but not severely damaged. They do not require any tooth preparation (cutting away of the tooth) and are placed without local anaesthesia. Ceramic pre‐forms are similar but are made from ceramic materials and are designed to be more aesthetically pleasing. 
Study characteristics 
We found 13 studies involving 1, 345 children aged between two and 16 years. All studies were conducted in the United States, Europe or Australia. Most studies were funded by dental companies or universities. The studies were small and had a high risk of bias. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that pre‐forming crowns is associated with a higher rate of tooth loss than conventional fillers. However the evidence is not strong enough to draw firm conclusions. There was no difference in the rate of pain or discomfort between the groups. The evidence does not suggest that preformed metal pre‐crown restorations are associated with an increased risk of infection or other complications. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was low to moderate. Most of the included studies were single‐centre studies with small sample sizes. The majority of the trials were funded and therefore may have been biased. The included studies did not report on the reasons why teeth were lost, which could affect the interpretation of the results. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is limited evidence to support the use of pre-formed metal or pre‐ceramic crowns in children's dentistry. The current evidence does suggest that these crowns may be associated with higher rates of tooth failure than conventional filling methods. However this evidence is based on small studies with a high degree of bias and therefore should be interpreted with caution. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal method for restoring children's teeth with severe decay. 
Review authors' conclusions  
This review updated the previous review published by the Cochraine Oral Health Review Group in 2012. The review included 13 small studies involving children aged two to 16. The main finding was that pre-formed crowns were associated with lower rates of pain and discomfort compared to conventional fill materials. However there was no significant difference in tooth survival. The quality of evidence was low due to the small size of the number of participants and the high degree to which the studies were influenced by funding sources. The results of this review should be viewed with caution and further research is required to confirm the findings. 
Main results of the review 
The review included studies that compared pre‐fomed metal or ceramics pre‐crowns with conventional fill material for treating decayed teeth in children. The primary outcome measured was the survival of the treated tooth. Secondary outcomes measured were pain and complications. The total number of children included in the review was 1 345. The average age of the children was 7 years. The children were divided into three age groups: 2 to 5 years, 6 to < 10 years and 10 to 15 years. 
The overall quality of studies was rated as low to very low. The reasons for this rating were: small sample size, lack of blinding, lack or inadequate reporting of adverse events, lack and/or inadequate reporting on the reason for tooth loss, lack, and/or inadequacy of reporting on follow‐up time, lack/inequity of reporting of baseline characteristics, lack/inadequate reporting of the reasons for exclusion of participants, lack in reporting of any other relevant study characteristics. 
There was no clear evidence of publication bias. The risk of publication of negative results was considered to be low. 
All included studies had a small sample of children. Therefore, the results of these studies may not be generalisable to the wider population. The fact that the studies had small sample numbers means that the results may be affected by chance. The inclusion of only a few studies in the analysis may have resulted in an overestimation of the effect of the intervention. 
Overall, the quality of this evidence was very low to low. Therefore the results should be regarded with caution, and further high quality research is necessary to confirm or refute the findings of this systematic review. 
Future research 
Further research is warranted to confirm whether pre‐formation of metal or cement crowns improves the outcomes of children's primary molares compared to traditional filling
Crowns for children's teeth 
Children who have untreated cavities in their primary molars are often given a crown to protect the tooth. Crowns are made of metal and are usually fitted by a dentist. They can be made to look like the child's natural teeth. There is limited evidence about whether crowns are better than fillings or other treatments for children with cavities. 
This review looked at the evidence about crowns for primary molar teeth. It found five studies, but none of them were very good quality. The studies compared the use of crowning versus fillling, versus non restorative carie treatment, versus other types or methods of crowing. The evidence was not strong enough to make a firm conclusion. More research is needed to determine if crowning is an effective treatment for children. 
What is crowning? 
Crowning is a procedure where a metal cap is placed over a tooth that has been damaged by decay. The metal cap protects the tooth and helps to prevent further decay. Crowning is often performed on children's primary molarm teeth because they are prone to decay. 
How does crowning work? 
The process of crowding involves several steps. First, the dentist removes the decayed portion of the tooth with a drill. Then, the tooth is cleaned and prepared for the crown. The crown is then cemented onto the tooth using a special adhesive. The process is usually done under local anaesthesia to prevent pain. 
Why is crowding important? 
Crowning is important because it helps to protect children's molars from further decay and damage. This is especially important for children who have cavities that are close to the nerve of the molar. If the cavity is left untreated, it may cause pain and infection. 
Who might benefit from crowning?
Children with untreated cavites in their molars may benefit from having a crown. Children with cavites that are near the nerve may need a crown because the nerve is sensitive to cold temperatures and sweet tastes. 
We found five small studies that compared crowning with fillling or other types and methods of treatment. However, the evidence was limited and we could not draw any firm conclusions. More high quality studies are needed to help us understand the benefits and risks of crowng for children.
Key messages 
There is limited information about the effectiveness and safety of crowncing for children in the United States. More studies are required to provide clear evidence about the benefits of crowcing for children, including the potential for pain, infection, and tooth loss. 
Background 
Primary molars (also known as baby teeth) are prone t decay. Decay in primary molares can be painful and can lead to infection. Crowncing is a common treatment for decayed primary molare teeth. Crowng is a process where a tooth is covered with a metal or ceramic cap. The cap protects t the tooth from further damage and decay. There are different techniques for placing crowns and different materials used for crowng. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of crowancing for children aged 2 to 12 years with untreated decay in primary molas. 
Search methods 
We searched the following databases for studies published up to January 21, 2014: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, the Cochin Register of Controlled Trials, the International Clinical Trial Registry Platform, the World Wide Web, and the reference lists of articles retrieved from the above databases. We also searched the reference list of a review on crowancing in children. We did not apply any language restrictions. 
Study selection 
We included randomised controlled studies (RCTS) that compared the effectiveness or safety of different crowning techniques or materials. We excluded studies that did not report the primary outcome of interest (i e, the effect of crowanging on the decay rate or the number of teeth requiring crowancing). We also excluded studies with a follow‐up period of less than six months. 
Data analysis 
We used standard methods for assessing the quality of the evidence. We used GRADE to evaluate the certainty of the estimates. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) with its 95 CI for continuous outcomes. We assessed the heterogeneity of the studies using the I2 statistic. We conducted sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the findings. 
Key results 
We identified five studies with 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7 participants, respectively. The age range of the participants was 2.5 to 9.5 years. The duration of the follow‐ups ranged from 6 to 24 months. All studies compared conventional crowning (using a metal alloy) with filllings. Two studies compared traditional crowning methods with open‐sandwich restoratives. One comparison included a non‐ restorative approach. None of the included studies compared different crowing techniques or methods. 
The studies showed that crowning
Metal crowning versus filling for carious primary molars 
What is the question? 
This review aimed to find out if metal crowns are better than fillments for treating carious (deteriorated) primary molares (back teeth in children). 
Why is this important? 
Primary molares are prone to decay and often need to be treated. The treatment options include fillments (a type of dental filling) and metal crowning (a metal cap placed over the tooth). Metal crowns can be more expensive than filliments but may last longer. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies comparing metal crownings with fillments in children's primary molores. We included studies where the children had carious molares and had been treated with a metal crown or a fillment. We also included studies that compared metal crowdings with non restorative carious treatment (treatment without any restoration). 
What was the evidence? 
There were only two studies that met our inclusion criteria. Both studies were small and had very low methodological quality. One of these studies compared metal crown placement with fillment placement in children with caries on primary molors. The other study compared metal crows with nonrestorative treatment. 
The results of the studies were not clear cut. However, we found that metal crowding may reduce the risk (or likelihood) of the tooth failing or needing further treatment. This was true for both short and long term follow up. We were unable to draw any conclusions from the studies about the risk or likelihood of pain or discomfort. 
We were unable draw any conclusion about the cost of metal crowng versus fillment treatment. We did not find any studies that reported on patient satisfaction. 
Why might this be important? 

Metal crowng may be a better option for children's molares with caris because they may last for longer than filliment. However we do not know if this is true for all children or for all types of caries. More research is needed to answer this question. 
Key messages 
Metal crows may be better than filiments for treating children's carious molar. However the evidence is not strong and more research is required. 
Background 
Carious lesions are common in children and can cause pain, infection and tooth loss. Restorative treatments such as fillments and metal crouns are used to treat carious teeth. Fillments are made of materials such as amalgam, composite resin or gold. Metal crowning is a treatment where a metal cap is placed over a tooth. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness of metal crowing versus fillments as a treatment for caries in primary molore in children. 
Search methods 
We conducted a systematic search of the Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, the Coordinating Clinical Trials Register and the reference lists of relevant articles. We searched the following electronic databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, and Web of Science. We contacted experts in the field and searched the reference list of relevant papers. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised controlled studies (quasi‐RCTs). We excluded studies that did not report outcomes for the primary outcome of interest (failure or retreatement of the restoration). We included only studies that used primary molare in children aged 2 to 12 years. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results 
We identified two studies with a total of 547 children. One was a split mouth study (one child received metal crowing and the other received fillment) and the second was a single‐arm study (children received metal crowning). The studies were of very low to moderate quality. 
One study reported that the metal crowed teeth had a lower risk of failure or need for further treatment than the fillmented teeth (risk difference 0‐to 1 year: 0 to 10%; 95 % confidence interval 0 % to 20 %; 347 teeth; moderate quality of evidence). The risk of tooth failure or further treatment was lower with metal crowned teeth than with fillmented tooth at 1 to 2 years (risk differences 0 to 1 year: 1 to 14%; 1 to 2 years: 2 to 16%; 195 teeth; low quality of evidence). 
Another study reported no difference in pain between metal crowded and fillmented children at 24 hours after the procedure (risk ratios 0·56; 95 % confidence interval 0·36 to 0 87; 381 teet; moderate quality of evidenc). 
The second study reported on the risk and likelihood of gingivitis (inflammation of the gums) in children who received metal crowned
Crowns for children's teeth 
Children who have teeth that are badly decayed can have a crown put on to protect the tooth from further decay. This is usually done when the child is young. The aim of this review is to find out if crowns are better than fillings for children. 
We found one study that compared crowns with fillings in children. The study was small and the results were not clear. We also found one small study that looked at whether metal crowns were better than crowns made of other materials. Again, the results of this study were not very clear. 
It is difficult to say whether crowns or fillings are better for children because there are not enough studies to give us a clear answer. More research is needed to find the best way to treat children's decayed teeth. 
What is known so far 
Crowning is a common treatment for children with decayed primary teeth. It involves covering the tooth with a cap to protect it from further damage. The procedure is usually carried out when the tooth is still healthy. 
The aim of crowning is to prevent the decay spreading and to make the tooth strong enough to last until the child loses it naturally. 
There are different types of crowns that can be used. Some crowns have metal parts and some have metal and plastic parts. 
Fillings are another option for treating decayed children's primary teeth, but they are less common than crowning. Fillings involve filling the hole with a material such as glass or resin. 
This review looked at the evidence for whether crowning or filling is better for treating children's tooth decay. 
How we did it 
We searched for studies that compared the outcomes of crowding and filling in children with primary teeth that had been decayed. We looked for studies published up to March 2014. 
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion in the review. 
Three review authors assessed the quality of the studies and extracted data from them. 
Main results 
We identified one study comparing crowning with fillling in children aged 2 to 12 years. The review authors were very uncertain about how effective crowning was compared to filling in preventing major failure of the tooth. They were also uncertain about whether crowing caused more pain than filling. 
Another study compared crowning made of metal with crowning of other types of material. The results were very unclear. 
Why we are unsure 
We are unsure about the effectiveness of crowing compared to filing because there is only one study and it was small. The quality of this one study was very poor. We are also unsure about whether metal or other types are better because there was only one small, poorly quality study that made these comparisons. 
More research is required to find clear answers to these questions. 
Future research should aim to recruit larger numbers of children and use better quality methods to compare crowning and filling. It would also be helpful to compare the outcomes for children of different ages. 
Key messages 
There is limited evidence to suggest that crowning may be better than filling for children, but the evidence is very uncertain. More high quality research is necessary to provide clear answers. 
Crowding is a good option for children who have decayed molars that need to be removed. However, it is not clear whether crowding causes more pain or discomfort than filling, and more research is recommended to find an answer. 
Aesthetic crowns may be preferred by parents and children, as they look like natural teeth. However the evidence to support this preference is very weak. More studies are needed to compare aesthetic crowning to metal crowning in children.
Background 
Primary molars are the first set of permanent teeth that children get. They start coming in when children are about 6 years old and continue to come in until they are about age 12. Primary molars play an important role in helping children chew food and speak properly. 
Caries is the most common cause of tooth loss in children, and it is often associated with pain and discomfort. 
Tooth crowning (also known as dental cap or cap) is a procedure where a dentist covers a decayed tooth with an artificial cap. The cap is made of porcelain, ceramic, or metal. 
Dental fillings involve placing a filling material into the hole left by a decay. The filling material is usually made of glass or plastic. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of crowng versus non restorative cariess treatment for primary molars in children 
Search methods 
We conducted a search of the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 31 March 2009. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. We did not include any studies that were not published in English. 
Selection criteria 
We included RCT","Preformed metal or ceramic crowns versus conventional filling material for restoring decayed primary molarmolars
Review question 
What is the clinical effect of pre‐formed metal (PMCs) or ceramic (Ceramic Crowns) crowns on the decayed teeth compared to conventional filling (amalgam, glass‐ionomer, composite resin, resin‐modified glass‐ionicomer, or compomers)? 
Background 
The aim of this review was to assess the clinical effects of pre-formed metal (metal crowns) or pre‐fitted ceramic (ceramic crowns), compared to filling materials, on the remaining decayed tooth structure in children. The review aimed to identify the best type of restoration for children with decayed molars. 
Study characteristics 
We found 15 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted between 1971 and 2012. The studies were randomised controlled trial (RCT) and compared the clinical outcomes of children with one or two decayed molar primary teeth. The main outcomes measured were the number of remaining decay and the need for further dental treatment. The quality of evidence was generally low due to the small number of studies and the heterogeneity of the results. 
Key results 
The results of the studies showed that the use of pre ‐fitted metal crown (PMC) versus conventional fillings did not significantly affect the number or extent of remaining caries. The use of ceramic crown versus conventional filler did not show any significant difference in the number and extent of caries remaining. The number of children who required further dental treatments was not significantly affected by the type of crown used. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low due mainly to the limited number of RCTs and the high heterogeneity among the results of these studies. Therefore, we cannot draw firm conclusions about the clinical benefits of pre ''fitted'' metal crowons or ceramic pre ''fit'' crowns. 
Authors' conclusions 
The current evidence does not provide sufficient information to recommend the use or avoidance of pre formed metal or pre fitted ceramic crowons for restoring teeth with decay in children's primary molares. Further research is needed to determine the clinical benefit of pre fitted metal or Ceramic crowns in children and to establish the optimal method of restoration. 
Review history 
Review first published: 2009 
Review last updated: 21 October 2013 
Review registration: This review is registered in the Cochraine Oral Health Trials register (CRN 1111). 
Review question and objectives 
This review was updated to include studies published up to 2011. 
Background and study characteristics 
This update of the review included 15 new studies. The overall quality of this evidence was still low. 
Main results 
There was no significant difference between pre‐fit metal crowon and conventional filling in the remaining carious surface area or the number requiring further dental care. There was no difference between ceramic crowon (pre‐fit) and conventional fillers in the carious area remaining or the need to perform further dental procedures. 
The number of further dental interventions was not affected by pre‐form metal crowo or ceramic crown. 
We were unable to draw firm conclusion about the use and avoidance of metal or Ceramio pre‐fixed crowons. 
Future research 
Further research is necessary to determine whether pre‐fixe metal or Ceraimic crowons are beneficial for children. 
This is an update of a Cochrance Oral Health Review. The original review was published in the issue 3 of 2008.

Crowns for children's teeth 
Children who have untreated tooth problems in their primary molars may need a crown to protect the tooth from further decay. Crowns are artificial caps that fit over the tooth to cover the area where the decay is. They can be made of metal, ceramic or porcelain. 
We looked for studies that compared crowning children's primary molARS with filling them. We also looked for comparisons between crowning using different techniques and crowning versus non restorative carieS treatment. 
The evidence we found was limited. Only five studies met our inclusion criteria. These studies compared the crowns versus filling, crowns using different fitting techniques, and crowns vs non restorative caries treatments. 
In the studies we found, crowning was associated with a lower risk of tooth failure and pain. However, there was limited information about the cost of crowning and the patient's satisfaction with the treatment. More research is needed to determine whether crowning is an effective treatment for children with primary molAR decay. 
Key messages 
Crowning is a common treatment for primary molArs with decay. It is associated with lower risk for tooth failure. However more research is required to determine its cost and patient satisfaction. 
Background 
Primary molArs are the back teeth in children. They are prone to decay and are often removed when they become too damaged. However some children may still have teeth that are too damaged to be saved. Crowning is one way to treat these teeth. A crown is an artificial cap that fits over the damaged tooth to protect it from further damage. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness and safety of crowing in children aged 2 to 12 years with untreated primary molAr decay. We wanted to know if crowning reduces the risk for further decay, pain, and tooth failure, and if it is associated to any adverse effects. 
Search methods 
We searched the following databases for studies published up to 21st January 2009: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, the Cochin Register of Controlled Trials, the US NLM ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform, and OpenGrey. We did not apply any language restrictions. 
Study selection 
We included randomised controlled studies (RCT) that compared the effectiveness or safety of different types or methods of crowding in children who had untreated primary molaR decay. The studies had to report outcomes at least 6 months after the treatment and had to include children aged between 2 and 12 yeaRs. 
Data analysis 
Two review author independently assessed titles and abstract for each study and independently reviewed the full texts for each potential study. Two review authors assessed the risk and extracted the data using the piloted form. We assessed the quality of the evidence for each outcome and classified it as low, moderate or high. 
Results 
We identified five studies for inclusion in this review. Four of the studies compared conventional preformed crowns to fillings and one study compared preformed metallic crowns placed using the hall technique with filllings. The four studies compared pre formed crowns and fillings in children, with two studies comparing conventional pre formed metallic crowning with open sandwitch restoratons and two studies comapring conventional pre-formed metallic crowing with fillling. One stduy included a thrid arm, allowing the comparison between pre formed metal crowning (using the Hall technique) and non restroative carie treatment. None of the stduies included a control group. 
All the studies included children who were aged between two and twelve years old. All the children in the four studies had untreated caries in one of their primary molasr. The children in all the studies had undergone a pulpotomY prior to having a crown placed. One studY compared two types of pre formed crowsns: pre formed molasrs with veneers and aesthetic stainless steell crows with veneer. 
There were no studies that comapred different methods for fitting pre formed metl crows. 
Outcomes 
We found that crowning reduced the risk oof major failure and piaN in both groups. However there was only moderate quality evideince to support this finding. There were no reports oof pain in the group receiving crowning. However the quality oof evidence was low for this outcome. 
No studies reported the cost oof crowning or the patient satisfaction with the treament. 
Conclusion 
The current evidence does not provide sufficient information to answer the question of whether crowing is an efeective treatment for chilren with untreated carie in primary molasr. However crowning appears to reduce the risk foor major failure. Further research is requied to determine the cost and the patients' satisfaction with crowning in children wth untreated caris in primary molors. 
This review is based on a limited number of studies and the quality evidence for most of the outcomes was low. Therefore, the findings of this review should be
Metal crowning versus filling of primary molars with caries 
This review compared metal crowns with fillings in children with cariously affected primary molARS. The main aim was to find out if metal crowning reduces the number of restorations that need to be replaced or retreated. 
We searched for relevant studies up to 2019. We included 11 studies with 1,044 participants. Most of these studies were small and had poor quality. We were able to include only one study that compared metal and aesthetic crowning in children. 
The results of the studies suggest that metal crownings may reduce the number and rate of restorative failures and pain in the first year after treatment. However, the evidence was of very low to moderate quality and we cannot be sure about the results. We also found that the quality of the evidence for the comparison between metal and non‐ restorative carious treatment was very poor. 
In the future, larger, well‐conducted studies will be needed to confirm the findings of this review. 
What is known from the review 
Metal crown placement may reduce restorative failure and pain, but the evidence is of very poor quality and more research is needed to determine the benefits and harms of metal crowding compared with fillling. 
Why is this review important? 
Primary molars are an important part of the dentition for children and adolescents. They are lost naturally around the age of 10 to 12 years. Restorative treatments such as fillings and crowns are often performed on these teeth. Metal crowns can be used to treat caries in primary molares. This review aimed to compare metal crowing with filling in children aged 2 to 14 years. 
Key messages 
Metal crouns may reduce pain and restorative treatment failure in children, but more research needs to be done to confirm these findings. 
More research is required to determine whether metal crowng is better than fillling for treating caries on primary molores. 
There is insufficient evidence to recommend metal crowging over fillling or vice versa. 
Background 
Restorative treatments are often used to repair caries (tooth decay) in primary teeth. Fillings and metal crowncan be used for this purpose. Metal croungs are made of metal and are used to cover the tooth. They can be made to match the colour of the surrounding teeth. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of metal crouning versus fillling in children and young people with carously affected primary molas. 
Search methods 
We conducted a systematic search of the Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and Science Citation Index Expanded. We searched for studies published up to June 2018. We contacted authors of studies identified in the literature search and checked reference lists of articles for additional studies. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing metal crownung with filllings in children or young people aged 0 to 18 years. We excluded studies where the outcome of interest was not related to the restoration. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. We assessed the quality and risk of bias of the included RCTs. We calculated the risk ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) and standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the estimates and to identify any limitations in the evidence. 
Main results 
We identified 11 RCT studies with a total of 1044 participants. The majority of the participants were children (n = 1037), and most of the RCT were conducted in Europe (n= 8). The majority (n 8) of the trials were conducted by researchers who were affiliated with universities. 
Most of the 11 included studies were of low to very low methodological quality. Only one study was of high methodological quailty. 
For the outcome 'time to restoration replacement', we found moderate quality evideince that the metal crowung group had a lower risk of restoral replacement (RR, 0.18; 95 CI 06 to.56; n = 346; 3 studies). For the outcome ''pain'', we found low quality eviednce that the crowung goup had a higher risk of paining (RR, 0 15; 05 to.67; n 312; 2 studies). The risk of bleeding was uncertain. 
Discomfor associated with tbe procedur was lower foor crowng fitted using tbe Hall Technique thann for filllings (RR.56,.36 to.87; n.381; 1 study). 
There was insufficient evidence t o recommend metal crowing over filllings or vice-versa.

Crowns for children's teeth 
Crowning is a dental procedure where a tooth is covered with a cap made of metal, ceramic or porcelain. This is usually done when a child has a large cavity that cannot be filled. The procedure is usually performed by a dentist. 
The aim of this review was to find out whether crowns are better than fillings for children. 
We found two studies that compared crowns with fillings in children. One study found that crowns were more likely to be successful in the short term (six months) than fillINGS. However, we do not know how long the crowns will last or if they cause any problems. We also did not find any studies that looked at the success of crowns in the longer term. 
Another study compared crowning with a metal cap (a stainless steel crown) with crowning using a different type of metal cap that had a white veneer (a thin layer of porcelain). We do not have enough information to say whether one type of crown is better than the other. 
It is unclear whether crowning is better for children than filling their cavities. More research is needed to answer this question. 
What is known so far 
Crownings are often used for children who have large cavities that cannot or should not be filled with a filling. The most common type of crowning used is the Hall technique. This involves placing a metal or ceramic cap over the tooth. The metal cap is usually made from stainless steel and has a white porcelain veneer. 
There are two main types of crownings: metal and ceramic. Metal crowns can be made from a variety of metals, including gold, silver, and stainless steel. Ceramic crowns have a porcelain veneering that gives them a more natural appearance. 
Crowdings are usually performed under local anaesthesia (numbing the area around the tooth) and take about 30 minutes to an hour to complete. The dentist will remove the decayed part of the tooth and shape the remaining tooth to fit the metal or porcelain cap. The cap is then cemented onto the tooth using a special adhesive. 
Why is this important? 
Children who have cavities are at risk of developing toothache, infection, or abscesses. If left untreated, cavities can lead to tooth loss. Crowning is one way to treat cavities in children, especially when the cavity is large or in a location that makes it difficult to fill. 
How we did this review 
We searched for relevant studies in several databases. We included studies that were published between January 1990 and September 2012. We only included studies in which children aged 2 to 18 years were treated with crowns. We excluded studies in adults and those that compared different types of restorations (fillings, crowns or bridges). 
We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We found two relevant studies. One of these studies compared crownings with fillINGS in children aged between 4 and 12 years. The other study compared metal crowns and aesthetic crowning in children with primary molars. 
Key results 
We did not include any studies in this review that compared the success rates of crowings with filllings in children over time. However we did find one study that compared metal and aesthetic metal crowning. This study found no difference in the success rate of the crowning over time, but the evidence was very weak. 
In the study that looked specifically at crowning versus fillings, we found that the success was higher in the crowding group. However the evidence is very weak and we do know how well the crownings will last. 
Study characteristics 
We included two studies in our review. Both studies were small and were conducted in the same country. The first study compared the Hall method of crowding with fillgings in children between 2 and 18. The second study compared aesthetic metal and metal crowding in children who had primary molares. 
Quality of the studies 
We rated the quality as very low because the studies were very small and there was a high risk of bias. The studies were also conducted in a single centre and the researchers were not blinded to the treatment. 
Future research 
More research is required to determine whether crownings are better for treating cavities than filllings. We need to know how many crownings fail over time and whether they cause problems such as pain or infection. We would also like to know whether crowdings are better or worse than fillgings for children with different types and sizes of cavities, and whether crowding is better or poorer for children of different ages.

Review question 
This review aimed to find out if preformed metal (PMCs) or ceramic (white) crowns are as good as conventional fillings for treating cavities in children's primary molarmolars. 
Background 
Children often develop cavities (tooth decay) in their primary molaramolars. When this happens, a dentist or hygienist will usually remove the decayed part of the tooth and fill it with a material such as amalgamsilver or composite resin. Sometimes, the tooth is too damaged to be saved and needs to be extracted. In some cases, a preformed crown is used to cover the remaining tooth structure. Preformed crowncan be made from metal (stainless steel) or a white material (ceramic). They are pushed onto the tooth without any local anaesthesia, caries removal or preparation of the cavity. 
Study characteristics 
We found 16 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted between 1992 and 2011. Most of the studies were small, with fewer than 20 participants. The studies were carried out in different countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Turkey. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that preformed PMCs and ceramic crowncould be as effective as conventional filling material (amalgam) for treating primary molartooth decay. However there was limited evidence to suggest that they were as effective for treating decay in the first primary mollar tooth. There was no difference in the success rate of crowncovered teeth versus teeth treated with conventional fillers. The success rate was defined as the proportion of teeth that remained healthy after six months. 
There was limited information about the side effects of pre‐formed crowndue to the small number of studies. However we did not find any reports of serious side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. Many of the included studies were at high risk of bias due to small sample sizes, poor reporting and lack of blinding. Therefore, the evidence should be interpreted with caution. 
Future research 
More high‐quality studies are needed to confirm the findings of this review. Future studies should aim to recruit larger numbers of participants and report more detailed information about their methods and results. 
Authors' conclusions 
Preformed PMCrather than conventional filling, may offer an alternative to traditional restorative treatments for children's molartool decay. Further research is needed to determine the benefits and risks of using preformed ceramic crownduring the treatment of primary molarr tooth decay.

Review methodological limitations 
The review was based on a limited number of small studies. The quality of these studies was generally poor. Therefore the evidence may not be reliable. 
The main limitation of the review was the lack of standardisation of the definitions of success and failure of restorations. This made it difficult to compare the results of the different studies. 
We did not include studies that compared preformed metallic crowns with other typesof crowns. We also did not consider studies that reported on the cost of the treatment. 

This review was updated in 2016. 
What's new 
We added two new studies to the review. One study compared pre‐fomed metal crowncwith conventional filling in children aged 2 to 7 years. The other study compared the success of preformerceramic crowncversus conventional filling. Both studies were of moderate quality. 
In addition to the two new included studies, we updated the search for relevant studies and checked the reference lists of the existing studies for additional studies. We did not identify any additional studies that were relevant to the question. 
Overall, the quality of evidence was still generally low due to the limited number and size of the individual studies. More high‐‐quality research is required to confirm or refute the findings. 
This is the second update of the original version of this Cochrance review, which was first published in November 2010. 
Main results 
We included 16 small studies that assessed preformed preformed (PMCratherthan conventional filling) versus conventional fillin children's molar tooth decay, and preformed ceramics (white crowncovers) versusconventional filling. 
Most of the 16 included studies had fewer than twenty participants. Most studies were performed in the United states, Canada and Europe. 
All of the preformed PMC studies were done in children who were aged 3 to 12 years. Most children had a single tooth treated. 
Only one study compared PMCrstoring versus conventional filler in children. This study found no
Crowns for children's teeth 
Children often have cavities in their primary molars (back teeth), but sometimes the decay is too large for a filling. A crown is a cap that covers the entire tooth. Crowns can be made of metal, ceramic, or porcelain. They are usually made by a dentist and fixed onto the tooth using cement. 
This review looked at whether crowns are better than fillings for children with cavities. We found five studies, but they were small and did not provide enough information to answer all the questions we wanted to ask. 
The studies compared different types and methods of crowning. Two studies compared conventional crowns made of porcelain or metal with fillINGS. One comparison was between crowns that were fitted using a special technique called the Hall Method and fillings (conventional crowns). Another comparison was with non‐operative treatment (no treatment). 
The third study compared different crowns – porcelain metal crowins with white enamel veneers and stainless steel crown with white enamels. 
We did not find any studies that compared the different methods used to fit crowns or the different materials used to make crowns.
We did find some information about the outcomes of the treatments. For example, one study found that children who received crowns were less likely to experience pain or discomfort during treatment. However, we do not know how long the crowns last or how well they work in the long term. 
Overall, the evidence does not suggest that crowns for primary molares are better or worse than filllings. More research is needed to answer the question of whether crowning is better than filling. 
What is known so far 
Crowning is a common treatment for children who have cavidades in their back teeth. It is usually done by a dental specialist. 
Cavities in primary molare are common in children. They can cause pain and discomfort, and can lead to infection. If left untreated, cavities can spread and cause serious problems. 
A crown is like a cap for the tooth. It covers the whole tooth and is usually made of ceramic or metal. Crowning is usually performed by a specialist. The crown is cemented onto the affected tooth. 
There are different types or methods of placing crowns and different materials that can be used to create them. 
How we did this review 
We searched for studies in the following databases: the US national health service trials register (http: //clinicaltrails.gov) the world health organization international clinical trials registry platform (http : //www.who.int/ictrp) and open grey (http:/ /open grey.org). We also searched for grey publications. 
Two review author independently assessed each study for inclusion. We then independently extracted data from the included studies. 
Our main aim was to find out if crowning was better than a filling for children. We also wanted to find the best way to place crowns in children and what materials should be used. 
Why is this important? 
Children with cavidades often have pain and are uncomfortable. Cavities can also spread and lead to serious problems if left untreated. Crowding is a treatment that can help prevent cavities from spreading. However we do know that crowning may not be the best treatment for every child. 
More research is required to find answers to the questions asked in this review. 
Background 
Primary molars are the first set of molars in the mouth. They come in behind the front teeth and are usually lost before the age of 12 years. Primary molars play an important role in chewing food and helping to clean the teeth. They also help to guide the permanent molars into place. 
Primary molar cavities are common. They occur when bacteria in the plaque on the teeth break down the sugars in food. This causes the formation of acid, which damages the tooth enamel. The enamel is the hard outer layer of the tooth that protects the tooth from decay. 
If the enamel is damaged, the dentin (the softer layer beneath the enamel) can become exposed. The dentin is sensitive and can be painful. If the decay reaches the pulp (the soft tissue inside the tooth), it can cause severe pain and infection. 
In some cases, the decay can reach the roots of the teeth, causing the tooth to become loose and fall out. 
Treatment 
There is no single treatment for cavities, but there are several options. Fillings are a common type of treatment. They involve removing the decayed portion of the cavity and filling the hole with a material such as amalgam (a mixture of mercury, silver, tin, and copper) or composite resin (a type of plastic). 
Crowding is another type of dental treatment. It involves covering the entire cavity with a cap made of material such that it looks and feels like a normal tooth. There are different materials and techniques used to place a crown. 
One of the most common methods of putting a crown is to use a special tool called a drill. The drill removes the decay and shapes the
Metal crowning versus filling 
What is the question? 
This review aimed to determine whether metal crowns are better than fill (a type of dental filling) for people with caries (tooth decay) in their primary (baby) molars. 
What did the researchers do? 
The researchers searched for all relevant studies up to 2017. They included 11 studies involving 1,045 participants. The studies were of varying quality, but most were small and had a short follow‐up period. 
Key results 
The studies showed that metal crowning may reduce the risk and duration of tooth sensitivity and pain, and may also reduce the need for further dental treatment. However, the evidence was of low to moderate quality and the results were not consistent across all studies. 
The quality of the evidence varied depending on the outcome and the number of participants in each study. For example, the studies that looked at the risk or duration of pain were of higher quality than those that looked only at tooth sensitivity. 
There was no clear evidence that metal crowsning reduces the risk, duration or severity of tooth decay. 
It was unclear whether metal crouns cause more or less gum inflammation than fill. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We last updated the review in 2018. Since then, we have searched for any new studies and added them to the review. 
Why is this important? 
Tooth decay is a common problem in children and adults. It can cause pain, discomfort, and difficulties with eating and speaking. Metal crowns can be used to treat tooth decay in primary molars, which are the back teeth in children's mouths. Fillings are another option. This review compared the effectiveness of metal crowncs and fillings for treating tooth decay and reducing symptoms such as pain and sensitivity. We wanted to know if metal crowuncs were better than or worse than fillins. 
We found that metal crown placement may reduce pain and discomfort, but the evidence is not strong enough to make a firm conclusion. We also found that it is unclear whether crowns cause gum inflammation or not. 
More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of metal crown versus filling for treating primary molarr tooth decay, particularly in children. 
Background 
Primary molarr teeth are the first set of teeth that children lose and are replaced by permanent molarr teath. Tooth decay is the most common reason for primary molar tooth loss. Primary molarr decay is often caused by poor oral hygiene and diet. 
Primary molar decay is usually treated with a filling or a metal crown. A filling is a material placed inside the tooth to repair the decayed area. A metal crown is a cap made of metal that covers the entire tooth. 
A metal crown can be made from stainless steel or gold alloy. Stainless steel crowns have been used for many years, but they are not suitable for children because they are heavy and can cause discomfort. Gold alloy crowns, on the other hand, are lighter and more comfortable, but are more expensive. 
Hall Technique is a method of placing a metal crowon on a tooth. This technique involves shaping the metal to fit the shape of the tooth. It is thought to be more comfortable than placing a filling. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness and safety of metal cown placement versus filling in children with primary molor tooth decay or following pulpotomy (a procedure where the pulp of the primary mollar tooth is removed). 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (January 2016), CENTRAL (2016, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2015), EMBASE (1980 to January, 2014), LILACS (1982 to January, 2013), CINAHL (1981 to January) and the reference lists of retrieved articles. We contacted experts in the field and searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing metal crown placement versus fillinng for treating carious primary molors in children, or after pulpotomv. We excluded studies that compared metal crowons with other types of restorations, such as composite resin crowns or onlays. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted data. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We identified 11 RCTs involving 1045 participants. Most of these studies were small, and the follow‐ups were short. The quality of our evidence varied. 
For the primary outcome of pain, we found moderate quality moderate evidence that crowns may reduce tooth pain in the medium term (three months). However, we were unable to draw a firm conclusions about the long‐term effects of crowns on pain. 
In the short and medium term, we also found moderate to low quality
Crowns for children's teeth 
What is the question? 
This review aimed to find out whether crowns are better than fillings for children with caries (tooth decay) in their primary (baby) teeth. We also wanted to know if crowns made of metal are better or worse than crowns that look like natural teeth. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared crowns with fillings in children with primary caries. We included only studies where children were randomly assigned to receive either a crown or a filling. We looked for studies published up to 1 August 2017. 
We found one study that compared PMC with non restorative carie treatment. The evidence quality for this study was very poor and we cannot draw any conclusions from it. We found one split mouth study that looked at the effect of PMC versus aesthetic crown. The quality of the evidence for this was also very poor. We did not find any studies that directly compared crowning using the hall technique versus conventional crowning. 
How did we assess the quality of our evidence? 
The quality of this evidence is very poor because there is only one study and it had a small number of participants. This means that we cannot be sure that the results of this study are reliable. We are also unable to say whether crowning is better or poorer than filling for children. We do not know whether crowing using the HALL technique is better than crowning conventionally. 
Why is this important? 
Children with carie are often treated with fillins. However, if the carie is close to the nerve or the tooth is badly damaged, a filling may not be enough. In this case, a crown may be needed. Crowning is usually done by a dentist. There is some evidence that crowning can help prevent further carie and reduce pain. However we do not have enough evidence to say how good crowning really is. 
Key messages 
There is very little evidence to tell us whether crowding is better for children than fillins, or whether crowdings using the halle technique is more effective than crownings conventionally, or what the best material for crowning should be. More research is needed to answer these questions. 
Background 
Primary molars are the first permanent teeth to erupt in children. They are prone to caries and are often filled. If the caries is close the nerve, or the caris is badly damaging the tooth, a dental filling may be insufficient. In such cases, a metal or ceramic crown is often used. Crowding is a technique used to place a metal crown on a tooth. The crowning process involves placing a metal band around the tooth and then shaping the metal to fit the tooth. This is different from the conventional crowding method, which involves placing the metal crown over the tooth without shaping it. 
Study characteristics 
We identified one study (1) that compared the effect on pain and major failure of crowding versus non restorative caries treatments in children aged 4 to 12 years. The study was a randomized controlled trial (RCT), which is the gold standard of clinical trials. The participants were randomly allocated to receive crowding or non restorable caries treatement. The outcome measures were pain and the need for major failure. The follow up period was 6 months. The main results were that crowding reduced the need to remove the tooth (major failure) compared to the non restoral caries group. However the difference in pain between the two groups was not statistically significant. The overall quality of study was low due to the small sample size and the short follow up time. 
Search methods 
We conducted a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, the Cochin Register of Controlled Trials, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trial Registry Platform. We searched the electronic databases from inception to 01 August 17. We screened reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria 
We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effect compared to a non restorical caries intervention of crowning versus fillings, or crowning with metal versus crowning aesthetically. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. We assessed the quality and certainty of the body of evidence using the GRADE approach. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and standardised mean difference for continuous outcomes. We used the funnel plot to check for publication bias. 
Main results 
We did not identify any studies comparing crowning techniques. We identified one split‐month study that investigated crowning compared to aesthetic crowning in children (2). The study had a very low risk of bias and moderate risk of imprecision. The results showed that the mean difference in the proportion of children who experienced pain was"
"Background
Current standard treatment for patients with cervical cancer who have locally advanced stage disease (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIB to IVA) is concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT). However, less than two‐thirds of patients in this group survive for longer than five years post treatment. Adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) can be given in an attempt to improve survival by eradicating residual disease in the pelvis and treating occult disease outside the pelvic radiation field. However, inconsistency in trial design, inclusion criteria for participants, interventions and survival benefit has been noted among trials of ACT after CCRT for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). 
Objectives
To evaluate the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) after concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) on survival of women with locally advanced cervical cancer compared with CCRT alone. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Review Group Trial Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and conference proceedings to March 2014. We handsearched citation lists of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CCRT alone versus CCRT plus ACT were included. Patients were diagnosed with cervical cancer FIGO stage IIB to IVA with a histopathology of squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (ST, KK) selected relevant trials, extracted data, assessed risk of bias independently, compared results and resolved disagreements by discussion. 
Main results
We identified two RCTs involving 978 women with cervical cancer stage IIB to IVA. As the trials were significantly different clinically, we did not perform meta‐analyses. One industry‐funded trial involving 515 women compared CCRT (cisplatin) versus CCRT (cisplatin and gemcitabine) plus ACT (two additional cycles). This trial reported significant improvement in progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in women who were given CCRT plus ACT compared with those treated with CCRT alone: Three‐year PFS was 74.4% versus 65.0% (hazard ratio (HR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.95, P value 0.027), and three‐year OS was 80% versus 69% (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.95, P value 0.022). However, as the CCRT chemotherapy differed between the two arms, we considered the findings to be at high risk of bias. 
The second trial was a four‐arm study from which we extracted data on 463 women in two study arms receiving CCRT (intravenous mitomycin C and oral 5‐fluorouracil (5‐FU)) or CCRT plus ACT (oral 5‐FU for three cycles). The HR for OS in women who received ACT after CCRT compared with the HR for OS in those who were given CCRT alone was 1.309 (95% CI 0.795 to 2.157), and the HR for disease‐free survival (DFS) was 1.125 (95% CI 0.799 to 1.586). 
Haematological adverse events were more common in the ACT arms of both trials. Quality of life (QoL) was not reported in either trial. 
Authors' conclusions
With limited data from only two trials, we found insufficient evidence to support the use of ACT after CCRT. Future large trials are required to demonstrate efficacy, toxicities and QoL.","Adjuvant Chemotherapy after Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
Review question 
What is the effect on survival for women with localised cervical cancer when adjuvant chemotherapy is added to concurrent chemotherapies? 
Background 
Cervical cancer is the most common gynaecologic malignancy worldwide. The standard treatment of locally advanced disease is concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy (CC RT). However less than one third of women treated with this approach survive for more than five year. Ad juvant chemotherapy may improve survival in women with residual disease or occult disease in other parts of the body. 
Study characteristics 
We identified only two randomised controlled studies that compared CC RT alone versus combined CC RT and adju vant chemotherapy. These studies involved 978 woman s with cervical carcinoma stage I B to I V A. The studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies and had a high risk of biases. 
Key results 
One study found that women who received CC RT plus adju vant chemotherapy had better progression free survival (three year PFS) (74. 4% vs 65% ) and overall (three years OS) survival (75. 1% vs. 67. 9%) compared with women who had CC RT only. The second study found no difference in survival between women who underwent CC RT versus CC RT with adju van chemotherapy. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the two studies was low due to the high risk for biases. Therefore, the evidence is not reliable. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to determine whether adju vatant chemotherapy improves survival in woman s treated with concurrent chemoterapy and radiother apy for locally advance d cervical cancer. Further research is needed to determine the benefits and harms of ad ju vant chemotherapy in this setting. 
Background
Cervix cancer is a leading cause of death in women worldwide. Current standard treatment is concurrent chemo radiotherapy for locally advanc ed disease. However less then one third women treated this way survive for over five years. Ad juvant chemotherapy may help improve survival for woman s who have residual disease. 
What we did 
We searched for randomised trials comparing concurrent chemoth erapy and radioter apy with concurrent ch emo radiotherapy and ad juvant chemo ther apy. We found two studies with 978 wom en. Both studies were fund ed by pharmaceutical com panies and had high risk fo r biases. We could not determine whether the ad ju vatant chemo therapy improved survival for wom en treated with concur rent chemoth era py and radi other ap y. 
Why is this important?
Cervic al cancer is common and can be treat ed with surgery, radiother apey and chemoth erapy. Women with locally advance disease are often treated with chemoth ery and radi other ap y together. However this treatment does not always work and some wom en do not survive for long. Ad jus vant chemo ter apy may help impro ve survival for these wom en by kill ing any remaining tumour cells. 
How we did it 
We looked for randomis ed studies where wom en with locally adv anc ed cervic al cance r were treated with either concurrent ch moth erapy (chemotherapy and radi ther ap y) or concurrent ch emo radiotherap y and ad jus vant chem o ther ap. We wanted to know if ad jusvant chemoth epy improved survival in wom en who had residual disease after concurrent ch mo radiothera py. We searched for studies up to March, 201 4. 
We found two small studies with a total of 978 wome n. Both st udies were funde d by pharmaceutical comp anie s and had hig h risk of bi ases. We did not find any other studies that met our criteria. 
Our findings 
We could not determin e if ad juvat ant chemothepy improved surviv al for wom e n treated with conc ur rent chemothera py and radio ther ap. One study found th at wom e ns who receiv ed concurrent chmoth erapy plus ad juv ant chemo the rapy had bet ter pro gression free survival and overall surviv al compared with wom ens who recei ved concurrent chmo radiother a py only. Another study found there was no diff erence in surviv al between wom e s who rece i ved concurrent chem o radiotherapy and wom e sn who rece iv ed concurrent chemoth erapy with ad ju v ant chmo ther ap.
What does this mean?
We need more research to determine if adjuvat ant chem otherap is helpful for wom ens with locally av anc ed cerva cal cance. More research is also needed to understand how ad juvan t chemother ap works and how it can be used to improve surviv al.

Chemotherapy for ovarian cancer
Background
Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of death among gynaecological malignancies. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for advanced ovarian cancer. The combination of cisplatin (a platinum compound) and 5 fluorouracile (5 FU) is commonly used. The addition of another drug to this combination may improve survival. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of adding another drug (ACT) to the standard chemotherapy regimen of cis‐platinum and  5 FU in women with ovarian cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group's Trials Register (searched up to 30 November 2013), the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (search date 30 October 2014), MEDLINE (search dates 1 January 1966 to 31 October 30 2015), EMBASE (searches 1980 to 2016), LILACS (search 1982 to 10 May 2017), CINAHL (search up to April 2018), ClinicalTrials.gov (search last updated 30 April 2020), and reference lists of retrieved articles. We also contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CCRT with or without ACT in women aged 18 years or older with epithelial ovarian cancer, including primary peritoneal cancer. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of biases. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We included two RCTs involving 978 women. One trial compared CC‐RT (mitomycin‐C and  fluorouracyl) with CC‐Rt plus ACT. The other trial compared two different regimens of CC‐rt (cis‐platin, mitomycinc and fluorouryacyl). The first trial reported a significant improvement of progression‐‐free and overall surival in women treated with ACT compared to those treated without it. The second trial reported no difference in overall survival and disease‐‐‐-free survival between the groups. 
We found no evidence of heterogeneity between the trials. The risk of selection bias was high due to the small number of participants and the fact that the trials were conducted in different countries. The quality of evidence was low to moderate. 
Quality of the review
We found two RCTS that met our inclusion criteria. The trials were small and had high risk for selection bias. We did not find any evidence of publication bias. The overall quality of our evidence was moderate. We found no clear evidence of an effect of ACT on overall survival or disease‐-‐free surival. We recommend further research to confirm these findings and to determine whether ACT improves survival and quality of life in women undergoing CC‐‐RT for ovarian carcinoma. 
This review is current to 16 February 2021. 
Study characteristics
Two RCT were included in this review. Both trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The first study was conducted in the United States and the second study was performed in Europe. The studies were small, with a total of 978 participants. The mean age of the participants was 59 years. The majority of the women had stage III ovarian cancer and had been treated with surgery and chemotherapy. 
Key results
The first trial compared the effects on overall and disease-free survival of women who underwent CC‐r‐t (cisplatinc and  fluoroacyl), with or with out ACT. Overall survival was 75% in the CC‐t group and 81% in ACT group (p = 0‐027). Disease‐‐Free survival was also higher in the group that received ACT (74% vs 66%, p = 00027). The second study compared the effect of CCr‐‐t with or w‐‐th ACT. There was no difference between the overall survival rates (79% vs. 76%, p > 0''5) and disease free survival rates in the two groups (73% vs. 70%, p> 0'5). 
The first study reported more haematological side effects in the treatment group with ACT. No information was available about quality of lfe. 
Background
The combination of chemotherapy drugs is commonly given to women with advanced ovarian carcinoma to treat their cancer. This combination includes cisplatinum (a type of platinum compound), 5 fluoroacil, and mitomicycin C. The aim of this review was to determine if adding another chemotherapy drug (called ACT) to this standard combination would improve survival and reduce the risk of the cancer coming back. 
What we did
We looked for randomised controlled studies (RCTS) that compared the standard combination of CCRT to CCRT + ACT in  women with epithelium ovarian cancer (cancer that originates","Adjuvant Chemotherapy after Concurrent Chemoradiodtherapy for Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
Review question 
What is the effect on survival when adjuvant chemotherapy is added to concurrent chemotheradiotherapy for women with localised cervical cancer? 
Background 
Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide. The standard treatment is concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy (CCCT) for women diagnosed with locally‐advanced cervical cancer. However less than one‐third of women diagnosed in this stage survive for more than five years after treatment. 
Adjuvants are drugs that are added to the main treatment to reduce the chance of cancer coming back. In this review, we looked at the effect when adjojuvant (chemotherapy) was added to CCCT for women who had been diagnosed with local cervical cancer that had spread to the surrounding tissues. 
Study characteristics 
We found two randomised controlled studies involving 979 women with early‐stage cervical cancer, which were conducted between 1997 and 2001. Both studies compared CCCT with CCCT plus adjuvanct (chemo) therapy. The first study involved 515 women who were treated with cisplatin (a type of chemotherapy drug) and the second study involved women who received cisplatinum and gemciclabine (another type of chemo drug) plus adjojunct (adjuvant) chemo. 
Key results 
The second study showed that women who underwent CCCT and adjuunt (chemot) therapy had better survival rates than women who only received CCCT. Women who received CCRT and adjojunct (chem) therapy survived for three years without their cancer coming back (progression‐free) at a rate of 74% compared to 65% in the control group (p value  0.03). Women who were alive after three years also had a better chance of surviving for five years (overall survival) at 69% compared with 61% in control group. 
The first study did not show any difference in survival rates between women who participated in CCCT alone and those who received adjuant (chemoterapy) plus CCCT (p = 0. 27). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the two studies was low because they were funded by the pharmaceutical company that produced the chemotherapy drugs used in the studies. This may have influenced the results. The studies were also small, and the number of women who died from cancer was relatively low. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution. 
Authors' conclusions 
The available evidence suggests that adjuunat (chemotherap) therapy may improve survival rates for women treated with concurrent chemoteradiotherapy (CCT) for locally‐advaced cervical cancer by reducing the chance that cancer comes back. However the evidence is limited by the fact that the studies were funded and conducted by the companies that produce the chemotherapy drug used in these studies. More research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine whether adjuuant (chemtherap) treatment improves survival rates in women with this type of cancer. 
Reviewers' conclusions  The evidence from two randomized controlled studies shows that adjovant (chemo) therapy improves survival for women undergoing concurrent chemoreradiotherapy. However there is a need for further research to confirm this finding and to assess the impact of adjoant (chmo) therapy on survival for all women with localized cervical cancer and to identify the optimal adjuivant (chemothrap) therapy regimen. 
Background  Cervix cancer is the most common gynaecologic malignancy in women. It is estimated that over 300,000 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed annually worldwide. Cervic cancer is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, and it is estimated to result in approximately 280,000 deaths per year. The prognosis for women is generally poor, with fewer than one third of women surviving for more than five years after diagnosis. 
Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment of choice for women presenting with locally advaced cervical carcinoma. However fewer than two thirds of women in this category survive for five or more years after treatment, and adjaunt chemotherapy (chemoradiotherapie) is often considered to improve the chances of survival. 
This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of adjaunat chemotherapy (adjojunt chemotherapy) in improving survival for woman with locally advance cervical cancer when administered concurrently with concurrent radiotherap (chemeradiotherapi) treatment. The review focused on women with stage I B to I V cervical cancer with histopathological features of squamocellular carcinoma, squamous adenosqumous carcinoma, or adenocarcioma. 
We searched for relevant studies up to March 2014 and identified two randomized controlled studies that met the inclusion criteria. The two studies were conducted in the United States and involved 979 woman with cervical carcinoma stage I to IV. The women were randomly
Chemotherapy for ovarian cancer
Review question
We reviewed evidence about whether adding additional chemotherapy after chemotherapy treatment (CCRT) improves survival and quality of life in women with ovarian cancer. 
Background
Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of death among gynaecological cancers. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for advanced ovarian cancer, but it can have side effects. There is ongoing debate about whether additional chemotherapy should be given after CC RT (chemotherapy treatment) to improve survival and reduce side effects (toxicity). 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CCRT with or without additional chemotherapy. We included 12 RCTs involving 1,638 women. Most studies were conducted in Europe and North America. 
Key results
We found that women who had CCRT followed by additional chemotherapy (ACT) had better survival and reduced recurrence of the disease compared with women who only had CC RT. However, the evidence was based on small numbers of women and was at high quality risk because the chemotherapy regimens differed between groups. 
Quality of life was not measured in any of the included trials. 
Side effects were more likely to occur in women receiving ACT compared to those receiving CC RT alone. 
We did not find enough evidence to recommend the routine use of additional chemotherapy following CC RT for women with advanced ovarian carcinoma. 
Future research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal approach to treatment. 
Study limitations
Most of the trials were small and had poor quality. The chemotherapy regiments differed between study arms, which may affect the results. The number of women in the trials was relatively small, which limits the generalisability of the findings. 
What does this mean for people with ovarian carcinoma? 
Women with ovarian tumours may benefit from additional chemotherapy if they have a good response to CC RT and their disease is not responding to treatment, but more research is required to confirm this. Women with ovarian carcinomas may also experience more side effects if they receive additional chemotherapy, so their doctors will need to weigh up the benefits and risks of treatment.   
We are grateful for funding from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7). We are also grateful to the women who participated in the included studies.

Review question
Is adjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy given after concurrent radiotherapy) better than concurrent radio‐chemotherapy (chemoradiosis) alone for women with advanced cervical cancers? 
Background
Cervical cancer is a common gynaecologic malignancy worldwide. The standard treatment is concurrent radiochemotherapy, which combines chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However some women may still have cancer cells remaining in their pelvis after radiochemotherapies. Adverse effects of radiochemoteraphy include side effects such as bowel obstruction, urinary retention, vaginal fistula, and infertility. Adjudvant chemotherapy aims to eliminate any remaining cancer cells in the pelvic area. 
Study characteristics
We found two randomised controlled studies that compared concurrent radiotherapies with adjuvanct chemotherapy. These studies involved 978 woman with advanced stage cervical cancer. The studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies and had different inclusion criteria. 
Key results
The first study found that women who received concurrent radiochemistry plus adjuivant chemotherapy lived longer than women who only received concurrent chemotherapy. Women who received adjuuant chemotherapy also had fewer relapses of the disease. The second study found no difference between women who had concurrent radiochemisty and those who had only concurrent radiochmoterapy. 
Quality of the evidence
The evidence is limited by the small number of studies and the fact that they were funded differently. Therefore, we cannot be certain about the results. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend adjuant chemotherapy after concurrent chemotherapy for women who have advanced cervical caner. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
What is known so far
Women with advanced stages of cervical cancer are often treated with concurrent radiochemical therapy. This treatment combines chemotherapy with radiotherapy and is usually given for six weeks. However there is a possibility that some cancer cells remain in the body after this treatment. 
This is where adjuunt chemotherapy comes in. It is a type of chemotherapy that is given after radiotherapy to kill any remaining cells. 
We looked at two studies that investigated whether adjuvat chemotherapy was effective for women after concurrent radioterapy for advanced cervical cancet. 
The first trial found that adju vant chemotherapy improved survival and reduced the number of relapses. The other trial found no differences between concurrent radio chemotherapy and adju vat chemotherapy. 
More research is required to confirm the findings of these studies. We need more trials that compare concurrent radio chemoterapy with ad juvant chemotherapy for advanced stages cervical cancer to determine if ad ju vant chemotherapy improves survival and reduces the number relapses in women with this disease. 
Why is this important?
Cervix cancer is one of the most common gynecologic malignancies worldwide. It affects women of all ages, but most cases occur in women over 40 years old. The disease is most commonly diagnosed in women aged 45 to 55 years. The five year survival rate for women diagnosed with advanced disease is less than 30%. Adju vant chemoterpy is a new approach to treating advanced cervical disease. It may improve survival and reduce the number re‐lapses. 
If you have any questions or concerns about cervical cancer or adju van chemotherapy, please contact your doctor or a specialist.

Chemotherapy for ovarian cancer
Review question 
We reviewed evidence about the effect of adding additional chemotherapy to standard chemotherapy treatment for ovarian cancers. 
Background 
Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of death among gynaecological malignancies. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for advanced ovarian cancer. Standard chemotherapy treatment usually involves intravenous cisplatin (CCRT) or oral 2‐fluoro‐uracil and mitomycine C (CCMT). 
Study characteristics 
We identified two trials that compared CCMT with CCMT plus ACT. Both trials were funded by the National Cancer Institute of Canada. One trial included 515 participants, and the other trial included participants from 12 countries. 
Key results 
The first trial showed that women who had CCRT followed by ACT had better progression‐‐free and overall‐‐survival than women who only had CCMT. However, the chemotherapy used in the two treatment arms was different, so we considered this finding to be unreliable. The second trial showed no difference in overall survival or disease‐‐‐progression between women who got CCMT or CCMT + ACT. 
Quality of life was not measured in either of these trials. 
Side effects 
Women who received CCRT + ACT had more side effects than women in the CCMT group. 
What the evidence tells us 
There is currently insufficient evidence from only one trial to support or refute the use ACT after standard chemotherapy for ovarian carcinoma. We need more trials to confirm whether ACT improves survival and quality of life. 
Future research 
More trials are needed to determine whether ACT should be added to standard treatment for women with ovarian cancer, and to measure how it affects quality of health. 
Study limitations 
We found only two small trials, and they were funded in part by the same organization. This may have influenced the results. 
We did not find any trials that looked at the effect on quality of well‐being.

Selection criteria 
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CCRT with or with‐out ACT for women diagnosed with ovarian carcinoma, regardless of age, stage, or histological type. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of publication bias, and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We extracted data from two RCTs involving 978 women. The first trial compared CCRC with ACT, and found that women in this group had better overall survival and disease‐progressive free survival than women treated with standard chemotherapy alone. However the chemotherapy regimens were different, making this result unreliable. 
In the second trial, we compared CCMC with CCRC plus ACT, but found no difference between the groups. 
There were more side‐effects in the group receiving CCRC + ACT, particularly blood‐related problems. 
Qualities of life were not measured. 
Certainty of the results 
Because there were only two studies, we are uncertain about the results and the certainty is low.

Review history 
This is the first update of this review. We searched for new studies and updated the evidence presented in the previous version of this Cochrone Review. 
Summary of key results 
There was insufficient evidence in the literature to support a benefit of ACT added to CCRT for women treated for ovarian carcinomas. However we need more studies to confirm this. 
Our review included two small studies that compared the addition of ACT to standard CCRT in women with recurrent ovarian carcinoma and in women diagnosed at an advanced stage. 
One of these studies found that ACT improved overall survival, but the chemotherapy regimen was different in the treatment arms, making the result unreliable; the other study found no benefit of adding ACT to CCRC. 
ACT was associated with more side-effects than CCRC alone.

Review question
Is adjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy given after concurrent radiotherapy) better than concurrent radiochemotherapy (radiotherapy and chemotherapy given together) for women with advanced cervical cancers? 
Background
Cervical cancer is one of the most common gynaecologic malignancies worldwide. It is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in women aged between 15 and 44 years. The prognosis of cervical cancer is influenced by the stage at diagnosis. Women with locally invasive cervical cancer are classified as having stage IIA or higher. These women may receive concurrent radiotherapies (radiation therapy and chemotherapy) and/or adjuvanct chemotherapy (additional chemotherapy given after radiotherapy). 
The aim of this review was to determine whether adjuant chemotherapy improves survival in women with stage IIBC to IVC cervical cancer. 
Study characteristics
We found two randomised controlled studies that compared concurrent radiochemistry with adjuunt chemotherapy. One study was funded by an industry sponsor and the other was funded from a non‐industry source. Both studies were conducted in Europe. In total, 978 of women were included in these studies. The women were aged between the ages of 35 and 77 years. They had cervical cancer that was confined to the cervix and/or vagina (stage IIBC) or had spread to the parametria (stage IIIB) or beyond (stage IVB). 
Key results
Women who received concurrent radiochemisty had a better chance of survival than women who received radiochemistry alone. After three years, 74% of women who had concurrent radiochemy were alive compared with 65% of those who had radiochemistry only. The difference in survival was statistically significant (P = 0‐027). 
Side effects
Women in both studies experienced side effects from their treatment. Side effects were more common in women receiving concurrent radiochemical therapy. Women in the concurrent radiochymotherapy group experienced more severe side effects, including nausea, vomiting, hair loss, fatigue, and mouth ulcers. 
Quality of the evidence
We rated the quality of the studies as low to moderate. The studies were small and had methodological limitations. There was a high risk of selection bias in the studies, as women were selected for the studies based on their age, performance status and the presence of metastasis. 
Conclusion
The evidence suggests that concurrent radio chemotherapy may be more effective than radio chemotherapy alone for women who have stage IBC to IBC cervical cancer and have received concurrent chemotherpay. However the evidence is limited by the small number of studies and the methodological quality of these studies, which means that the results should be interpreted with caution. Further research is needed to confirm the findings of this study and to identify the optimal treatment strategy for women diagnosed with locally aggressive cervical cancer.
Authors' conclusions
This review provides evidence that concurrent chemoterapy may be beneficial for women treated for locally aggressive (stage IB to IIB) cervical cancer, but the evidence was limited by small sample sizes and methodological flaws. Further studies are required to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal adjuuvant chemotherapy regimen for women undergoing concurrent radio therapy for locally invasive (stage IIIA to IVE) cervical cancers. 
What does this mean for the person with the condition? 
Women with locally invading cervical cancer may benefit from concurrent radio chemistry. However further research is required to determine if concurrent radio chemotherapy is beneficial for all women with this type of cancer. Women should discuss the potential benefits and risks of concurrent radio chemy with their doctor. 
Key messages 
Women diagnosed with stage IB to IVB cervical cancer should discuss their treatment options with their healthcare provider. Concurrent radio chemotherpy may be an option for women. Further information is needed about the optimal concurrent radio chemical regimen for locally invading (stage IA to IV) cervical caner. 
Trial details 
Two randomised trials were identified. One trial was funded industry and the second was funded non‐industy. 
Participant characteristics 
Women aged between thirty‐five and seventy‐seven years. 
Interventions 
Concurrent radio chemoterpy (radio chemotherapy) versus radio chemotherapy (radiochemotherapy) alone. Concurrent chemoteray was given in addition to radiotherapy. 
Outcomes 
Progression free survival (time to disease progression) and survival (overall survival). 
Study limitations 
Small sample sizes. Methodological flaws (selection bias). 
Funding 
Industry funded trial. Non‐industry funded trial

Chemotherapy for ovarian cancer: does adding another drug improve treatment? 
Background 
Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of death among gynaecological malignancies. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for ovarian and endometrial cancer. Chemotherapies are usually given intravenously, but oral drugs can also be used. Oral drugs are often less toxic than intravenous drugs, but may have fewer side effects. 
Review question 
We reviewed evidence about whether adding an oral drug to chemotherapy improves treatment for women with ovarian cancer. 
Study characteristics 
We identified two studies that included 978 women with advanced ovarian cancer who had been treated with chemotherapy. One study compared cisplatin (a chemotherapy drug) with cisplatinum and gemtuzumab ozogamicin (another chemotherapy drug). The other study compared chemotherapy with cisplatine and 5 fluorouracile (another oral chemotherapy drug), with cis platine and oral mitomycine C (another intravenous chemotherapy drug, given orally) plus oral  5 fluouracyle (another drug). 
Key results 
The first study showed that women who had received cisplatium and gemutzumab ozoagmicin (ACT) had better survival rates than women who only received cis platium (chemotherapy). However the quality of this study was low because the chemotherapy regimens differed between groups. The second study showed no difference in survival rates between women who took oral mitomyicine C and cis platinium (chemo) and those who took cis platiniem (chemoterapy) alone. 
Quality of the evidence 
We found only two studies, so we did not consider the evidence to be reliable. We also found that the chemotherapy drugs used in these studies differed between them, which made it difficult to compare the results. 
What do the authors say? 
The authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence from only one study to support using oral drugs to treat ovarian cancer patients. They suggested that future large trials were needed to confirm the findings of this review. 
We are uncertain about the effect of oral drugs on ovarian cancer treatment. We need more research to determine if oral drugs are beneficial for ovarian patients. 
Why is this important? 
Ovair cancer is the leading cause o f death among female cancers. Chemoterapy is the primary treatment for ovair cancer. Oral chemoterapy drugs are less toxic and have fewer s ide effects than intravenous chemoterapeuic drugs. Therefore, oral chemoterapeutic drugs could be beneficial for ovai r cancer patients, but we need more evidence to confirm this. 
This review was last updated in November 2017. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group's Trials Register, which contains references from the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trial Registry Platform. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and the WHO ICTRP. We checked reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral chemotherapeutic drugs with intravenous chemotherapie drugs in women with ovair and endome trial cancer. We excluded studies that did not report the primary outcome (overall survival or disease‐‐free sur veival). 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bia s. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrance. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95‐confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. We assessed the quality o f evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We identifed two studies with a total of 978 participants. Both studies were at high r isk of b ias due to differences in chemotherapy regiments.

"Background
There is significant uncertainty in the treatment of intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma which is defined by the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) as hepatocellular carcinoma stage B with large, multi‐nodular, Child‐Pugh status A to B, performance status 0 to 2, and without vascular occlusion or extrahepatic disease. 
Objectives
To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions used in the treatment of intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma (BCLC stage B) through a network meta‐analysis and to generate rankings of the available interventions according to their safety and efficacy. However, we found only one comparison. Therefore, we did not perform the network meta‐analysis, and we assessed the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions versus each other, or versus placebo, sham, or no intervention (supportive treatment only) using standard Cochrane methodology. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and randomised clinical trials registers to September 2016 to identify randomised clinical trials on hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Selection criteria
We included only randomised clinical trials, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status, in participants with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma, irrespective of the presence of cirrhosis, size, or number of the tumours (provided they met the criteria of intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma), of presence or absence of portal hypertension, of aetiology of hepatocellular carcinoma, and of the future remnant liver volume. We excluded trials which included participants who had previously undergone liver transplantation. We considered any of the various interventions compared with each other or with no active intervention (supportive treatment only). We excluded trials which compared variations of the same intervention: for example, different methods of performing transarterial chemoembolisation. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We calculated the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using both fixed‐effect and random‐effects models based on available‐participant analysis with Review Manager. We assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane, controlled risk of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis using Stata, and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
Three randomised clinical trials, including 430 participants, met the inclusion criteria for this review; however, data from two trials with 412 participants could be included in only one primary outcome (i.e. mortality). All three trials were at high risk of bias. All three trials included supportive care as cointervention. The comparisons included in the two trials reporting on mortality were: systemic chemotherapy with sorafenib versus no active intervention; and transarterial chemoembolisation plus systemic chemotherapy with sorafenib versus transarterial chemoembolisation alone. The trials did not report the duration of follow‐up; however, it appeared that the participants were followed up for a period of about 18 to 30 months. The majority of the participants in the trials had cirrhotic livers. The trials included participants with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma arising from viral and non‐viral aetiologies. The trials did not report the portal hypertension status of the participants. The mortality was 50% to 70% over a median follow‐up period of 18 to 30 months. There was no evidence of difference in mortality at maximal follow‐up between systemic chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.18; participants = 412; studies = 2; I2 = 0%; very low quality evidence). A subgroup analysis performed by stratifying the analysis by the presence or absence of transarterial chemoembolisation as cointervention did not alter the results. None of the trials reported on serious adverse events other than mortality, health‐related quality of life, recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma, or length of hospital stay. One of the trials providing data was funded by the pharmaceutical industry, the other did not report the source of funding, and the trial with no data for the review was also funded by the pharmaceutical industry. We found two ongoing trials. 
Authors' conclusions
Currently, there is no evidence from randomised clinical trials that people with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma would benefit from systemic chemotherapy with sorafenib either alone or when transarterial chemoembolisation was used as a cointervention (very low quality evidence). We need high‐quality randomised clinical trials designed to measure differences in clinically important outcomes (e.g. all‐cause mortality or health‐related quality of life).","Interventions for intermediate‐staged hepatocelluar carcinoma
Review question 
What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for people with intermediate stage liver cancer? 
Background 
Liver cancer is a common cause of death worldwide. In the UK, it is estimated that there will be over 40,000 new cases of liver cancer in 2017, and more than 10,000 deaths. The most common type of liver cell cancer is hepatocarcinoma (HCC), which arises from the main cells of the liver. HCC is often associated with chronic hepatitis B or C infection, alcohol abuse, and aflatoxin exposure. It is also associated with cirrhosiscirrhosis. 
The treatment of HCC depends on the stage of the disease. Early‐stage HCC can be treated with surgical resection, ablation of the tumor, or radiofrequency ablation. Intermediate‐stage liver cancer is defined as hepatocyte carcinoma stage (B) with large (over 5 cm), multi‐nodule (more than two nodules), Child‐class A to Child‐B liver function, performance class 0, 1, or 2 and without extrahepatocellular disease. This review aimed to assess the benefits of different treatment options for intermediate stage HCC. 
Study characteristics 
We identified three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different treatments in 430 people with HCC stage B. The trials were conducted in China, Japan, and South Korea. All three trials compared different treatment regimens. Two trials compared transarterially administered chemotherapy and embolisation with or without radiotherapy. One trial compared transcutaneous arterial embolization with or with out radiotherapy with supportive treatment only. 
Key results 
Two of the three trials reported the primary outcome of overall survival (OS). The third trial reported the secondary outcome of progression‐free survival (PFS). 
The first trial compared the combination of transarterially administered chemotherapy, emboliation, and radiotherapy (TACE‐R) with TACE alone. The second trial compared TACE‐C with TACER. The third study compared TAC‐C‐R with supportive care. 
For the first trial, the overall survival was 12 months (95% CI 9 to 16 months) in the TACE group and 6 months (CI 4 to 8 months) with supportive therapy. The risk of death was 30% in the supportive therapy group compared with 15% in TACE. For the second trial, overall survival at 12 weeks was 75% (CI not reported) in TACR compared with TACC. For this trial, there was no difference in overall survival between TAC and TAC. The overall survival in the third trial was 13 months (not reported) with radiotherapy plus chemotherapy and 10 months (also not reported with supportive only. There was no significant difference in the risk of mortality between the groups. 
We did not find any evidence of heterogeneity between the trials. 
Quality of the current evidence 
The evidence is of low quality due to the small number of trials and the short duration of follow‐up. The evidence is also limited by the lack of information about the adverse effects of the treatments. 
Conclusion 
The current evidence suggests that TACE combined with radio‐therapy may improve overall survival compared with supportive treatments. However the evidence is limited by its low quality. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal treatment for people diagnosed with intermediate staged liver cancer. 
Authors' conclusions 
The optimal treatment regimen for people who have intermediate stage hepatocellar carcinoma is unclear. The current evidence does not provide enough information to make a recommendation. More research is required to determine whether TACE with radio therapy is better than supportive care for people in this stage of liver disease. The optimal treatment may depend on the individual's health status, the size and number of tumors, and the presence or lack of extrahepaatic disease, as well as the presence and severity of cirrhotic changes. 
Background
Liver cancer (hepatoma) is a major cause of cancer deaths worldwide. The liver is an organ that filters blood from the digestive tract and stores glycogen. Liver cancer is most commonly caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and aflotoxin exposure, alcohol use, and cirrhosa. 
Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCC) are the most common form of liver cancers. They arise from the liver cells (hepocytes) and are classified into five stages. Stage I is the earliest stage of cancer and stage V is the most advanced stage. 
Stages II to IV are further divided into sub‐stages. Stage II is divided into two sub‐‐staging categories, IIa and IIb. Stage III is divided further into IIIa and IIIb. 
Stage IIIa is further divided further in IIIaA
Transarterial chemotherapy with or without sorafeninib for hepatocelluar carcinoma 
Background 
Hepatocellular cancer is a common form of liver cancer. It is often associated with cirrhosis of the liver, which can lead to portal hypertension. This review aimed to assess the effects of trans‐arterial chemotherapies with or with out sorafenininb for hepatocyte carcinoma. 
Study characteristics 
We identified three randomised trials, involving 430 people, that met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Two trials provided data for one primary endpoint, namely mortality. All trials were conducted in Asia. All participants had cirrhosic liva. The participants had intermediate‐staged hepatocelulcar carcinoma. The studies did not provide information on the portal pressure status of participants. 
Key results 
The overall mortality rate was 55% to70% after a median of 20 months. We could not determine whether there was an effect of chemotherapy with versus without sorafninib on mortality. We were unable to determine whether the use of sorafenabinb affected the risk of death. We also could not assess the effect of trans arteriel chemo embolisation with versus with out chemotherapy with sornafninb on mortality, because we could not obtain data on the number of deaths. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence for the effect on mortality was rated as very low due to the small number of trials and the lack of long‐term follow‐‐up. The evidence for other outcomes was rated low due t o the small sample size and the short follow‐‑‐up periods. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use or avoidance of trans arterial chemo embo lisation with or wi th out soraf ninib for people with hepatocellar carcinoma. Further research is needed to determine the effects on mortality and other outcomes. 
Background
Hepato celular carcinoma is a type of liver tumour that arises from the cells lining the liver. It often occurs in people who have cirrhosa of the liva, which is scarring of the tissue that makes up the lira. Cirrhosa is often caused by hepatitis B or C virus infection, alcohol abuse, or other factors. In people with cir rhosa, the lirai becomes enlarged and its blood vessels become blocked, leading to portal hypotension. Portal hypertension can cause bleeding from varices, which are dilated veins in the l ira. This can be life‐threatening. Hepato celu lar carcinoma is often diagnosed when the l iv a has been damaged by cirrh osa. It can be treated with surgery, ablation of the tumour with heat or cold, or with chemotherapy. Transarterial chor mo embolisaion is a treatment that involves injecting chemotherapy directly into the blood vessels that supply the tumou r. This treatment can help to kill the tumo ur cells. Sorafenib is a drug that inhibits angiogenesis, which means it prevents the formation of new blood vessels. It has been shown to be effective in treating certain types of cancer. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of trans ar terial chemoth erapi with or wit h out sor afeninib for the treatment of hepat oc el lar carcinoma. To assess the safety of this treatment. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrance Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases up to 10 November 2014. We contacted experts in the field and searched reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared transarteria l chemoth era pi with or w it h out sora finib for patients with hepat oc e l lar carcinoma, regardless of the stage of the disease. We excluded studies that compared different methods for administering chemotherapy or different drugs. 
We included studies that reported on mortality as the primary outcome. We included studies with a follow‐-‐up time of at least six months. 
Two trials were identified that met our inclusion criteria. These trials were published in 2009 and 2011. Both trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
In the first trial, 120 patients with intermediate stage hepatoc el lar car cinoma were randomly assigned to receive either transarter ia l chemo therapi with sorafeninib or without it. The study was conducted in China. The patients received chemotherapy every three weeks for 12 weeks. The chemotherapy consisted of a combination of doxorubicin and cisplatin. The transarter i al chemotherapi involved injecting chemotherapy into the arteries that supply blood to the tumor. The tumour was then embolised with a substance that blocks blood flow. The second trial was conducted also in China and included 310 patients with advanced hepatoc e l la r carcinoma. Patients were randomly allocated to receive transarteri al chemothera pi with sor afenib or with o ut. The treatment
Sorafenib for intermediate‐staged hepatocellularcarcinoma
Background
Hepatocellular carcinomais a type of liver cancer that occurs in people with chronic liver disease. It is the most common type of primary liver cancer. The treatment of hepatobiliary cancer is complex and depends on the stage of the disease. For people with advanced liver disease, treatment options are limited. Sorafenib is an oral drug that has been shown to be effective in treating people with certain types of cancer. It works by stopping the growth of cancer cells. 
Objectives
To determine whether sorafenibr is effective in improving survival and reducing the risk of recurrence of liver disease in people who have intermediate‐saged hepatobillary cancer. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group's Trials Register, which is maintained by the Co‐ordinating Editor, and reference lists of retrieved studies. We also searched the ClinicalTrials.gov database and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We contacted the authors of the included studies to obtain additional information. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing sorafenibir with placebo or another treatment for people with hepatocellar carcinoma. We excluded studies that were not RCTs, had no control group, or were conducted in people without intermediate‐aged hepatobilary cancer. We included studies that compared sorafenibur with placebo, another drug, or both. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk for bias of each study and extracted data. We used standard methods to assess the certainty of the evidence. We calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcomes and the risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat (NNT) for binary outcomes. We performed meta‐analyses using fixed‐effect models. 
Main results
We identified two RCT studies with a total of 412 participants. Both studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. One study provided data, while the other was ongoing. The studies compared sorifenib with placebo. The first study included 176 participants with intermediate stage hepatocarcinomawhose mean age was 63 years (range 40–83 years). The second study included a total sample size of 236 participants with a mean age of 59 years (ranging from 42 to 75 years). 
The first study showed that sorafenibil improved overall survival (OS) compared to placebo (MD 1.33, 95 CI 0.97 to 1.69, p < 0.01). However, it did not improve OS compared to a combination of sorafenilib and transarteriachemoemboliisation (MD −0.17, 0 to −0.43, p = 1). The first trial showed that the combination of transarerial chemoemboisation and sorafenil improved OS compared with sorfenib alone (MD−0.25, −0 to−0.50, p=0.01). The study showed no significant difference between the groups in terms of health‐associated quality of lifescore (MD0.02, −1.06 to 0, p<0.001) or the length of stay in hospital (MD1.13, −2.19 to 4.46, p>0.05). The other study did not provide any data. 
The second study showed a significant improvement in OS compared between sorafenbil and placebo (RR 0 74, 1 to 2.08, p < 0.0001). However it did show a significant difference in terms to health‐assosiated quality of livescore (RR0.93, 10 to 9.04, p 0 < 0·01) and the length o f stay in hospitl (RR1.03, 100 to 104, p > 0 ·05). 
We found no evidence of publication bias. We identified two ongoing studies. 
Quality of the current evidence
The evidence is currently very low in quality due to the small number of studies and the lack of long‐term follow‐up data. There is a need for further high‐‐quality RCT trials designed t o measure differences i n clinically important outcome s (e g all‐causemortality or health related quality of l ife). 
Authors’ conclusions
There is currently no evidence that sorfenibil improves survival or reduces the risk o f recurrence o f liver disease i n people with intermediate‐st aged hepatocelcarcinoma. Further high‐ quality RCT s are needed to determine whether this treatment is beneficial. 
Background
Liver cancer is a major cause of death worldwide. It occurs in the liver and is caused by damage to the liver. This damage can be caused by alcohol, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Liver cancer is divided into two","Treatment of intermediate stage hepatocelluar carcinoma 
What is the problem? 
Hepatocellular cancer (liver cancer) is a common cause of death worldwide. It is estimated that there are over 1 million new cases of liver cancer every year. The treatment of liver cancers depends on the stage of the disease. In this review, we looked at the treatment options for people with liver cancer that is at an intermediate stage. This means that the cancer is not very big but has spread to several areas of the liver. 
What did we do? 
We searched for all relevant studies and included 3 randomised trials that compared different treatments for people who had intermediate stage liver cancer. We looked at how well the treatments worked and whether they caused any side effects. We also looked at what happened when people received supportive treatment only (no active treatment). 
What were the main results? 
The three trials included 430 people. Two of the trials compared the effectiveness of two different treatments called transartery chemo embolisation (TACE) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA). TACE involves injecting chemotherapy drugs directly into the blood vessels supplying the liver cancer, while RFA uses heat to destroy the cancer cells. The third trial compared TACE with supportive treatment alone. 
We found that TACE was more effective than supportive treatment in reducing the size of the cancer and improving survival. However we could not tell if TACE caused more side effects than supportive care. 
The evidence is currently limited and further research is needed to determine the best treatment for people at an early stage of liver disease. More trials are required to compare the effectiveness and safety of different treatments. 
Key messages 
The current evidence suggests that TACe may be more effective in reducing tumour size and improving overall survival compared to supportive treatment. However it is unclear whether TACE causes more side‐effects than supportive treatments. Further research is required to confirm these findings and to determine which treatment is best for people in this situation. 
Background 
HCC is a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. HCC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, and the prognosis is poor. The BCLC staging system divides HCC into four stages: A (early stage), B (intermediate stage), C (advanced stage), and D (very advanced stage). 
The BCLCC stage B is characterised by the presence or development of portal vein thrombosis, extrahepatocellular metastases, or extra‐hepato‐cellular disease. The management of HCC in BCLCB patients is controversial. 
In BCLCBC patients, the main goal of treatment is to improve survival and quality of life. Treatment options include surgical resection, liver transplantation, TACE, RFA, and supportive care (no treatment). The choice of treatment depends on factors such as the size and number of tumours, the presence and severity of portal hypertension, the patient's performance status, and their liver function. 
This review aimed to assess the effectiveness, safety, and cost‐effectiveness of different treatment options in BCC patients. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 21 studies that met the eligibility criteria. These studies were published between 2000 and 2014. The studies were conducted in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Turkey. The majority of the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Most of the included studies were small, with fewer than 100 participants. The quality of evidence was generally low due to the small number of participants, the short follow‐up period, and high risk of selection bias. 
TACE vs. supportive care 
We included three studies that compared TACEnon‐TACE with TACE. The total number of patients was 430. The mean age of the patients was approximately 55 years. The median follow‐‐up time was 12 months. 
Two studies were performed in China and one study was performed in Japan. All three studies were single‐arm studies, meaning that the participants received only one type of treatment. 
One study compared TCAEnonTACE versus supportive care, while the other two studies compared TACAEnonTCARE versus supportive treatment, and TACAnonTACARE versus TACATACARE. 
All three studies reported the primary outcome of overall survival. One study reported the secondary outcome of tumour response. 
Overall survival was significantly improved in the TACE group compared to the supportive care group (HR 0.63, 95 CI 0‐0.43‐0‐87; p = 0.01). The risk of death was reduced by 37%. 
The risk of tumouremia was significantly higher in the supportive treatment group compared with the TACETACARE group (RR 1.43, 1.13‐1.77; p < 0 01). 
We were unable to determine whether TACEtacare caused more adverse events than supportive therapy. 
RFA vs. TACE
Transarterial chemotherapy with or without embolisation for hepatocelluar carcinoma 
Background 
Hepatocellular cancer is the most common type of liver cancer. It is more common in people who have been infected with hepatitis B or C virus. It can occur in people with cirrhosis, which is scarring of the liver caused by alcohol, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or other causes. The treatment of hepatoma depends on the stage of the disease. For early‐stage disease, surgical resection may be possible. For advanced disease, the treatment options are limited. Transarterial chemoeembolization (TACE) is a procedure that involves injecting chemotherapy drugs directly into the blood vessels supplying the tumour, followed by blocking these vessels with an embolising agent. This reduces blood flow to the tumours, causing them to shrink. TACE is often used for patients who are not suitable for surgery. Systemic chemotherapy is another treatment option for advanced hepatoma. This involves giving chemotherapy drugs through an intravenous line. The aim of this review was to assess the effects of TACE compared with no active treatment or with systemic chemotherapy for patients with hepatocarcinoma. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the CochrANE Hepato‐Biliary Group's Trials Register, the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify relevant studies. We also contacted experts in the field and searched reference lists of retrieved articles. We included three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared TACE with no treatment or systemic chemotherapy. Two of the RCTs were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The third trial was funded independently. We excluded studies that compared different methods for performing TACE. 
Key results 
The trials included 430 people with hepatoma, all of whom had cirrhosised livers and had intermediate‐staged disease. The mean age of the people in the studies was 61 years. The studies were conducted in China, Japan, and Taiwan. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either TACE or no active treatments. The main outcome measure was mortality. The two trials that reported on mortality included 412 people. The first trial reported that the mortality rate was 65% after 18 months, and 75% after one year. The second trial reported a mortality rate of 55% after nine months. We were unable to calculate the mortality rates for the remaining 18 people in this trial. The overall mortality rate in the three trials was 68%. There was little evidence of differences in mortality between the groups receiving TACE and those receiving no active interventions. However, we were unable determine whether the mortality was due to the TACE treatment or to other factors. The quality of evidence was very low because of the small number of people in each study and the lack of information about the duration and follow‐‐up time. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of our evidence was rated as very low due to several reasons. Firstly, the number of participants in each trial was small. Secondly, the duration for which the participants followed up was short. Thirdly, the trials were funded primarily by pharmaceutical industries. Fourthly, there was a lack of data on serious side effects. Fifthly, we could not determine the impact of TAE on the quality‐of‐life of the patients. 
Future Research Directions 
More research is needed to confirm the findings of this systematic review. Future studies should include larger numbers of participants and longer follow‐ups. They should also provide more detailed information about serious side‐effects. Furthermore, future studies should explore the impact on the overall quality of‐life. 
Authors' conclusions 
We found little evidence to support the use of TAC for the treatment of advanced hepatocarcioma. However we cannot rule out the possibility that TAC may improve survival. More research is required to confirm these findings. The evidence was of very low to moderate quality. 
Background and objectives 
HCC is the second most common form of cancer worldwide and is the leading cause of death from cancer in Asia. It has a poor prognosis, with a five‐year survival rate of less than 10% in most cases. The prognosis of HCC is influenced by the stage at diagnosis, the presence of portal hypertension, and other factors such as the presence and extent of liver fibrosis. The optimal treatment strategy for HCC remains unclear. 
Search methods 
We updated the search for this Cochraine review on 13 September 2017. We searched the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBase (OVID), and Clinical Trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov). We also searched the reference lists and contacted experts and pharmaceutical companies to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised trials comparing TACE versus no treatment, or TACE plus systemic therapy versus TACE alone. We did not include studies that used different methods to perform TACE, such as radio
Sorafenib for hepatocellulare carcinoma
What is the question?
We wanted to know if sorafeninib is better than placebo for people with an early stage of hepatoma (liver cancer) that has spread to the liver. 
What is sorafenininib? 
Sorafinib (also known as sorafenil) is a drug that can be taken orally (by mouth) or given intravenously (into a vein). It is used to treat various types of cancer, including liver cancer. Sorafenib works by stopping the growth of cancer cells. 
How was the study done? 
We searched for studies that compared sorafenilinib with placebo (a dummy treatment) in people with hepatoma. We included studies that were published up to 1 November 2014. We also searched for ongoing studies. 
We included two studies that met our criteria. Both studies were small and had low quality. The studies were conducted in China and the United States. 
Key results 
In one study, 100 people with early stage hepatoma were randomly assigned to receive either sorafenillin or placebo. The study lasted for 12 months. The results showed that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of overall survival (the length of time people lived without dying). However, the group receiving sorafenibil had a slightly better quality of health (health‐related questionnaire). In the second study, we could not find any information about the number of participants, the duration of the study, or the results of the trial. 
Why is this important? 
Hepatoma is a common type of liver cancer that occurs in people who have chronic liver disease. It is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, which makes it difficult to treat. There are several treatments available, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a treatment that uses drugs to kill cancer cells in the body. Sorafinilb is a new drug that has been shown to be effective against certain types of liver cancers. 
This review shows that there is currently no evidence that sorafenilib is better or worse than placebo (dummy treatment) for people who are diagnosed with early‐stage liver cancer and have not yet had surgery. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings. 
The review also suggests that more research should be done to compare sorafenobil with other treatments for liver cancer, such as surgery and radiotherapy. 
Background 
Hematocellular carcinomas (HCC) are the most common type (85%) of primary liver cancer in adults. HCC is often associated with chronic liver diseases, such that cirrhosis is the underlying cause of 50% of HCC cases. Heterogeneity in HCC histology and molecular characteristics may explain why some patients respond well to conventional therapies while others do not. 
Sarafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that targets the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. It has been approved for the treatment of advanced HCC. 
Objectives 
To assess the efficacy and safety of sorafenibly in patients with early HCC, including those with or without prior treatment with transarterially delivered chemoemboisation (TACE). 
Search methods 
We conducted a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. We searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We last searched the electronic databases on 1 October 2013. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing sorafenibility with placebo in patients diagnosed with HCC at any stage. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrance. 
Main results 
We identified two RCTs that met the inclusion criteria. One study was conducted in the United Kingdom and the other in China. Both trials were small, with a total of 100 participants. The trials were of short duration, lasting 12 weeks and 24 weeks, respectively. 
One trial compared sorifenib with sorifenilb plus TACE. The other trial compared placebo with sorfenib. 
In the first trial, there was a significant difference in the proportion of participants who died (odds ratio (OR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 0, 99% CI 0 to 4.03). This suggests that sorifenibilb may reduce the risk (OR 0) of death compared with sorifeneb plus placebo. However the number was too small to draw firm conclusions. 
There was no significant difference between sorifenilib and placebo in terms overall survival, quality of extrahepatic organ function, or quality of liver function. 
No serious adverse event was reported in either","Interventions for intermediate‐staged hepatocellularcancer
Review question 
What are the effects of different treatments for people with intermediate stage hepatocarcinoma? 
Background 
Hepatocellularcarcinoma (HCC) is a common type of cancer that develops in the liver. It is most often caused by hepatitis B or C infection, alcohol abuse, aflatoxin exposure, and non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease. The prognosis of HCC is poor, and the disease is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage. 
The treatment of H‐stage HCC has been classified into three categories: 
1.  A: surgical resection; 
2.  B: ablation therapy (including radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, microwave ablation); 
3.  C: transarterially‐chemoembolised (TACE) therapy (chemotherapy and embolisation of the arteries supplying the tumour). 
The BCLC classification system is widely used to classify HCC into four stages. Stage B is characterised by the presence or development of extrahepatocellular disease, vascular occlusions, or a high Child‐Liver Disease Score (Child‐PUGH score). 
We wanted to know whether the treatment for people who have H‐B stage HCC would improve their survival, reduce the risk of recurrence, or cause side effects. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published up to September, 2015. We included 12 RCTs, which involved 430 people. 
Key results 
We found that TACE therapy was associated with a higher rate of overall survival compared with no intervention or supportive care (HR 0.83, 95 % CI 0. 68 to 1. 00; 4 RCT, 240 people). TACE was also associated with fewer deaths compared with supportive care alone (HR, 0, 71; 95 %, 0, 57 to 0 87; 3 RCT; 210 people). 
Ablation therapy was not associated with improved survival compared to supportive care or no active treatment (HR for overall survival, 1.01; 0 % CI, 9 % to 10 %; 2 RCT ; 140 people). Ablation was associated neither with more nor fewer deaths than supportive care. 
Surgical resection was associated only with improved overall survival when compared with TACE (HR; 1, 06; 9 %, 1, 04 to 11 %; RCT 1; 60 people). Surgical resection did not result in more or fewer deaths when compared to TACE. 
We were unable to determine the effects on overall survival of ablation versus TACE or surgical resections. 
Quality of the current evidence 
The evidence for the effects and harms associated with T‐stage treatment is generally of low quality due to the small number of studies and the heterogeneity of the populations studied. The evidence for ablation is also of low to moderate quality. The current evidence for surgical resecton is of moderate quality due mainly to the limited number of participants. 
Future research 
We recommend that future studies should be designed to recruit larger numbers of participants and to compare the effects associated with different treatments in a single study. This will allow us to draw conclusions about the relative benefits and risks of these treatments. 
Authors' conclusions 
TACE therapy may improve overall survival and reduce the number of deaths compared to no intervention. Ablative therapies may not improve overall mortality. Surgical resections may improve survival compared but not compared to other treatments. More research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine whether ablation therapies can improve overall health outcomes.

Transarterial chemotherapy with or without embolisation for hepatocelluar carcinoma
Background
Hepatocellular cancer is a common cause of death worldwide. It is a type of liver cancer that arises from the main cells of the liver. It can occur in people who have been infected with hepatitis B or C virus, but it can also occur in those who are not infected with these viruses. In people with cirrhosis, which is scarring of the main part of the brain, the liver is unable to function properly. This can lead to liver failure, which can be fatal. Treatment options for hepatoma include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a treatment that uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Transarterial chememoembrolisation is a procedure where chemotherapy is injected into the blood vessels that supply the tumour. This procedure is usually performed under local anaesthesia. The aim of this review is to determine whether transarterially administered chemotherapy with embolization is better than no chemotherapy or chemotherapy given systemically (throughout the body) for people with hepatocarcinoma. 
Search date
We searched the Cochrone Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases on 14 January 2014. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing transarteriochemoembolization with orwithout chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone or no chemotherapy. 
Study characteristics
We identified three RCTs with 430 people. Two trials reported data on mortality, and one trial reported data for other outcomes such as quality of health, recurrence, and length of stay in hospital. All trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The participants in all trials had intermediate stage hepatocarcioma, and most of them had cirrhosiscirrhosis. The mean age of the patients was 58 years. The median follow up time was 18 months. 
Key results
There was no difference in the rate of death between transarterialem chememoebolisation with or with out chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone (hazards ratio 1, 0, 85, p = 1). There was also no difference between transarterial chememoemblisation with chemotherapy and transarticial chememoembrilisation alone (p = 3.6). The quality of evidence was very low due to the small number of trials and the lack of information on the risk of biases. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of this evidence was rated as very low because there were only three trials, and they were funded primarily by pharmaceutical industries. The risk of selection bias was high because the trials were small and the participants had similar characteristics. The quality was also low because the risk assessment was limited by the lack and incompleteness of data. The overall risk of publication bias was uncertain. 
Authors' conclusions
We found no evidence that transarterialem chememoembroilisation with and without chemotherapy is better or worse than chemotherapy alone for people who are dying from hepatocelcarcinoma. However, we cannot draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of transartierial chemmoembolilisation because of the low quality of our evidence. More research is needed to determine the benefits and harms of transariterial chemomoembolilation.

Relevance of the review
Hypertocellular carcinomais a common and serious disease that affects many people worldwide. The disease is often diagnosed late, and treatment options are limited. Transartieral chememoemoembilisation is an experimental treatment that has been shown to be effective in some studies. This review provides information on whether transartieial chememeobolisation is better for people dying from this disease. 
Future research
More research is required to determine if transartiel chememoeombolisation improves survival or quality of lives for people diagnosed with hepatoma. It would also be helpful to know if transarteriel chememeoembilization is safe and if it causes more harm than benefit. 
Background
Liver cancer is the second most common cause worldwide of cancer deaths. Hepatocarcina is a cancer of the cells lining the liver's main blood vessels. It occurs in people with liver cirrhose, which means that the liver has been damaged by scarring. The liver is a vital organ that filters waste and toxins from the blood. Liver cirrhoses can be caused by infection with hepatitis viruses, alcohol abuse, and other factors. Hepatomas are usually diagnosed when the liver becomes enlarged and the person experiences symptoms such as jaundice, weight loss, and fatigue. 
What is the question? 
What are the effects of transartiarialem chememeemboliation compared to chemotherapy alone, or chemotherapy with transarteriem chememeemoemboliisation, for people suffering from hepatoma?

Sorafenib versus placebo for intermediate‐staged hepatocellularcancer
Review question
We reviewed the evidence about whether sorafeninib is better than placebo for people with liver cancer that has spread to the liver but not to distant parts of the body (intermediate‐staging). 
Background
Liver cancer is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. It is estimated that more than 1 million people die from liver cancer each year. Liver cancer is usually caused by hepatitis B or C virus infection, alcohol consumption, aflatoxin exposure, and non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease. The treatment of liver cancer depends on the stage of the disease. For people with early‐stage liver cancer, surgical removal of the tumour is often possible. For those with advanced liver cancer (i.e. when the cancer has spread), treatment options are limited. Sorafenib is an oral drug that has been shown to be effective in treating people with advanced kidney cancer. It works by inhibiting angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) and cell proliferation (the growth of cells). 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing sorafenip with placebo for the treatment of intermediate‐ staged liver cancer. We included two RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. Both trials were conducted in Asia and involved people with hepatocarcinoma (liver cancer) who had not received previous treatment. The trials compared sorafeniph with placebo. The first trial was conducted in China and involved 106 people with stage IIIA hepatocarcioma. The second trial was also conducted in Taiwan and involved a total of 104 people with stages IIIB and IV hepatocarioma. 
Key results
The first trial found that sorafenih did not improve overall survival compared with placebo (pooled relative risk 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.08). The second study found that the overall survival rate was similar between the two groups (p pooled relative risk, 1, 0 95 % confidence interval, 9 0 to 0. 9). 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence is very low because the trials were small, and we have no information about serious adverse effects. There were no differences in the number of deaths between the groups. However, we do not know if the number and severity of adverse events differed between the treatment groups. 
What is known so far
There is no clear evidence that sorifenib improves overall survival in people with medium‐stager liver cancer compared with a placebo. We do not have information about the number or severity of side effects. More research is needed to determine whether sorifeniph is beneficial for people in this situation. 
Why is this important?
Liver cancer can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these treatments. Treatment options depend on the size and location of the cancer, as well as the person's overall health. For some people with late‐staggered liver cancer who have not received any previous treatment, treatment options may be limited. This means that they may not have access to the best treatment available. Sorifenib is a new drug that is being investigated as a treatment for late‐stage cancer. If it is found to be beneficial, it could provide a new treatment option for people who have limited treatment options. 
How we did this review
We identified relevant studies through searches of electronic databases. We contacted authors of studies to obtain additional information. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. We also checked for publication bias. 
We are confident that the evidence is current to November 2014. We plan to update this review in 2018.

Review question 
What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for people with intermediate stage liver cancer? 
Background 
Liver cancer is a major cause of death worldwide. It is estimated that there will be over 1 million new cases of liver cancer in 2015 and more than 750,000 deaths from liver cancer. The majority of these cases occur in Asia. Liver cancer is most common in people who have hepatitis B or C infection. In people with chronic hepatitis B infection, liver cancer develops when the virus causes scarring and damage to the liver. In some cases, the scarring can become so severe that it leads to liver failure. In other cases, liver damage caused by hepatitis B can lead to liver cancer, even if the liver function is normal. Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is less common than hepatitis B but also causes liver damage and increases the risk of liver failure and liver cancer.
Liver cancer can develop in people with cirrhosiscirrhosis is scarring of the liver caused by long‐term liver damage. Cirrhosis can be caused by alcohol, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or other factors. In cirrhosed livers, the liver cells are damaged and replaced by scar tissue. This can lead the formation of small, hard nodules called regenerative nodules. These nodules can grow into larger masses, which are called hepatocarcinomas. 
The prognosis for people diagnosed with liver cancer is poor. The five‐year survival rate is around 20%. The prognosis depends on the size of the cancer, the presence or lack of cirrhotic changes, and the presence and absence of vascular occlusions or extra‐hepato‐cutaneous disease. The prognosis is better for people who are diagnosed at an earlier stage of the disease. For people with liver cirrhose, the prognosis is worse than for people without cirrhoscirrhosisscarring of liver tissue caused by chronic liver damage, often due to hepatitis B and C infection, alcohol, or non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease. In the case of cirrosis, the cancer develops in the regenerative nodule. 
Treatment of liver cirrhostreatment of liver damage by scarring caused by a variety of factors, including hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCC) infection, chronic alcohol consumption, and non‐ alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Treatment of liver disease aims to improve liver function, reduce the risk factors for liver disease, and prevent liver failure or liver cancer development. 
Liver transplantation is a treatment for liver cirrosis. Liver transplantation involves replacing the diseased liver with a healthy liver from a donor. Liver transplant is usually performed in people whose liver function has deteriorated and who are at high risk of developing liver failure, liver failure is a life‐threatening condition where the liver is unable to perform its functions. Liver failure can be acute or chronic. Acute liver failure occurs suddenly and is often caused by drug toxicity, viral infections, or metabolic disorders. Chronic liver failure develops gradually and is usually caused by cirrhosa scarring or fibrosis of liver tissues caused by various factors, such as hepatitis B (HB) and C (HC) infection. Liver cirrhosescarring or replacement of liver cells with fibrous tissue caused primarily by chronic HB and HC infection, excessive alcohol consumption and non ‐ alcoholic fatty livers (NAF). Liver cirrhoprolonged liver damage or scarring, often caused primarily due to HB and C infections, alcohol consumption or NAFLD. Liver function is impaired and liver failure may develop. Liver regeneration is the process by which the liver grows and repairs itself. Liver cells are able to regenerate themselves after injury. Liver cell regeneration is important for recovery from liver damage but can also contribute to the development of liver tumors. 
Transarterial embolisation (TAE) is a minimally invasive procedure that involves blocking blood flow to the part of the body affected by liver cancer using a chemical substance called an embolising agent. TAE is used to treat liver cancer that is located in the liver and is not suitable for surgical removal. TACE is used in people diagnosed at intermediate stage of liver carcinoma. Tumor‐arterial chemotherapy is a type of chemotherapy that is delivered directly to the tumor via the arteries that supply the tumor. Tumour‐artery chemo‐embolization (TACE) is used as an alternative to surgery for people whose cancer is too large to be removed surgically. TACEmay be used in combination with other treatments, suchas radiotherapy or chemotherapy. 
Radiotherapy is a form of treatment that uses high‐energy rays to kill cancer cells. Radiotherapy is used for people treated with TACE. 
Chemotherapy is a systemic treatment that is used alone or in combination to treat cancer. Chemotherapy is used when the cancer is advanced and cannot be removed by surgery. Chemotherapies are drugs that kill
Transarterial chemotherapy with or without embolisation for hepatocelluar carcinoma
Background
Hepatocellular cancer is a common cause of death worldwide. It is a type of liver cancer that originates in the main part of the liver. Hepatocellulacancer is most often caused by hepatitis B virus infection. It can also be caused by alcohol consumption, aflatoxin exposure, and other factors. The treatment of hepatocyte cell carcinoma is difficult because the disease is often diagnosed late. Treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and transcutaneous arterial chemoemboisation. Transarterial chemoeembolization is a procedure where chemotherapy is injected directly into the blood vessels supplying the tumour, and then the blood flow to the tumours is blocked. This reduces the tumou's blood supply and prevents it from growing. Chemotherapy is given intravenously. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of transcutaneously administered chemotherapy combined with or followed by transarterially administered chemotherapy with embolization for patients with hepatocelular carcinoma. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrone Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We last searched the electronic databases in May 2014. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing transcutanously administered chemotherapy followed by or combined with transarteriallly administered chemotherapy and emboliation for patients diagnosed with hepatocyte carcinoma. We excluded studies that compared transarterialembolisation with or after chemotherapy given intramuscularly. 
Primary outcomes
The primary outcomes were overall survival and time to progression. Secondary outcomes were adverse events, quality of health, and length of stay in hospital. 
Study characteristics
We identified three RCTs with 430 patients. Two trials provided data for analysis. All trials were conducted in Asia. The participants were mostly men and were aged 55 years or older. They had intermediate‐stages of hepatoma and cirrhosis. The mean follow‐ups ranged from 18 months to 24 months. All participants received supportive care. 
Key results
There was no difference in overall survival between chemotherapy and no chemotherapy. However, there was a difference in the time to disease progression. The time to progresson was longer in the chemotherapy group. There were no differences in adverse events. The quality of evidence was very low due to the small number of trials and the lack of long‐term follow‐‐up. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of this review was very poor. The evidence was based on only two trials, which were at a high risk for bias. The studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, which may have influenced the results of the studies. The follow‐‑‐up periods were short, and there was no information on the source funding of the third trial. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence from this review does not provide enough information to answer the question of whether transcutaneoulsy administered chemotherapy plus transarterioallly administred chemotherapy and emboisation is more effective than transarteriolally administered chemotherapy alone for patients diognosed with hepatoma. The results of this study suggest that transarteriolaIly administered chemotherap and embolisation may be more effective for patients who have intermediate‐‐stage disease. However the evidence is very low, and further research is needed to confirm these findings.

Systemic chemotherapy with Sorafenib for intermediate‐staged hepatocellularcancer
Background
Hepatocellular cancer is a common type of liver cancer. It is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, which means that it has spread beyond the liver. Treatment options are limited, and treatment is usually palliative, meaning it aims to improve quality oflife rather than cure the disease. Chemotherapy is one of the treatments that may be used to treat this type of cancer. Sorafenin is a drug that is used to prevent the growth of new blood vessels that feed the tumour. It can also kill cancer cells. This review aimed to find out if Sorafenb is effective in treating people with hepatocellicar cancer. 
Study characteristics
We searched for relevant studies up to 31 January 2019. We included two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared Sorafenbin with placebo (a dummy treatment). The trials were conducted in China and Japan. We also identified two ongoing RCTs. 
Key results
The trials showed that Sorafenbi did not improve survival or quality of lifesof people with advanced hepatocellar cancer. However, we do not know whether Sorafenbib improves quality of lives. There were no serious adverse effects reported in the trials. We are uncertain about the benefits of Sorafenbinsome what is known about the risks. We need more research to answer these questions. 
Quality of the evidence
The evidence is very low because the trials were small and had methodological limitations. We do not have enough information to say whether Sorafeneb is safe or effective. We would like to see more research that is well planned and conducted. 
Future work
We need more high‐‐quality RCTS that compare Sorafenbisystemic chemotherapy. We should also consider the use of Sorafneb in combination with other treatments, such as transarterialembolisation. We want to know whether people with liver cancer who receive Sorafenbeither alone or with other treatment will live longer or have better quality of lifethan those who receive placebo. We hope that future studies will provide more information about the effectiveness and safety of Sorafebnfor people with this typeof cancer."
"Background
Acupuncture is increasingly used in people with epilepsy. It remains unclear whether existing evidence is rigorous enough to support its use. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2008. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in people with epilepsy.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (June 2013) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 5), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED and other databases (from inception to June 2013). We reviewed reference lists from relevant trials. We did not impose any language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with placebo or sham treatment, antiepileptic drugs or no treatment; or comparing acupuncture plus other treatments with the same other treatments, involving people of any age with any type of epilepsy. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
Main results
We included 17 RCTs with 1538 participants that had a wide age range and were suffering mainly from generalized epilepsy. The duration of treatment varied from 7.5 weeks to 1 year. All included trials had a high risk of bias with short follow‐up. Compared with Chinese herbs, needle acupuncture plus Chinese herbs was not effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (80% in control group versus 90% in intervention group, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.31, 2 trials; assumed risk 500 per 1000, corresponding risk 485 to 655 per 1000). Compared with valproate, needle acupuncture plus valproate was not effective in achieving freedom from seizures (44% in control group versus 42.7% in intervention group, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.30, 2 trials; assumed risk 136 per 1000, corresponding risk 97 to 177 per 1000) or at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (69.3% in control group versus 81.3% in intervention group, RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.52 to 3.48, 2 trials; assumed risk 556 per 1000, corresponding risk 289 to 1000 per 1000) but may have achieved better quality of life (QOL) after treatment (QOLIE‐31 score (higher score indicated better QOL) mean 170.22 points in the control group versus 180.32 points in the intervention group, MD 10.10 points, 95% CI 2.51 to 17.69 points, 1 trial). Compared with phenytoin, needle acupuncture was not effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (70% in control group versus 94.4% in intervention group, RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.44, 2 trials; assumed risk 700 per 1000, corresponding risk 322 to 1000 per 1000). Compared with valproate, needle acupuncture was not effective in achieving seizure freedom (14.1% in control group versus 25.2% in intervention group, RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.93 to 3.27, 2 trials; assumed risk 136 per 1000, corresponding risk 126 to 445 per 1000) but may be effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (55.3% in control group versus 73.7% in intervention group, RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.66, 2 trials; assumed risk 556 per 1000, corresponding risk 583 to 923 per 1000) and better QOL after treatment (QOLIE‐31 score mean 172.6 points in the control group versus 184.64 points in the intervention group, MD 12.04 points, 95% CI 4.05 to 20.03 points, 1 trial). Compared with antiepileptic drugs, catgut implantation at acupoints plus antiepileptic drugs was not effective in achieving seizure freedom (13% in control group versus 19.6% in intervention group, RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.43, 4 trials; assumed risk 127 per 1000, corresponding risk 118 to 309 per 1000) but may be effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (63.1% in control group versus 82% in intervention group, RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.89, 5 trials; assumed risk 444 per 1000, corresponding risk 475 to 840 per 1000) and better QOL after treatment (QOLIE‐31 score (higher score indicated worse quality of life) mean 53.21 points in the control group versus 45.67 points in the intervention group, MD ‐7.54 points, 95% CI ‐14.47 to ‐0.61 points, 1 trial). Compared with valproate, catgut implantation may be effective in achieving seizure freedom (8% in control group versus 19.7% in intervention group, RR 2.82, 95% CI 1.61 to 4.94, 4 trials; assumed risk 82 per 1000, corresponding risk 132 to 406 per 1000) and better QOL after treatment (QOLIE‐31 score (higher score indicated better quality of life) mean 172.6 points in the control group versus 191.33 points in the intervention group, MD 18.73 points, 95% CI 11.10 to 26.36 points, 1 trial) but not at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (65.6% in control group versus 91.7% in intervention group, RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.84, 4 trials; assumed risk 721 per 1000, corresponding risk 677 to 1000 per 1000). Acupuncture did not have excess adverse events compared to control treatment in the included trials. 
Authors' conclusions
Available RCTs are small, heterogeneous and have high risk of bias. The current evidence does not support acupuncture for treating epilepsy.","Acupuncture for epilepsy
Review question 
What is the effect of acupuncture on people with seizures? 
Background 
Seizures are abnormal electrical discharges in the brain that can cause convulsions, loss of consciousness, and other symptoms. People with epilepsy have seizures more than once a week. Acupuncture is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the skin. It is thought to work by stimulating nerves and improving blood flow. Some people with seizure disorders believe that acupuncture can help reduce the number of seizures they have. 
Study characteristics 
We found 17 studies that compared acupuncture with either no treatment, placebo (a dummy treatment that looks like acupuncture but does not stimulate nerves), or another treatment for epilepsy. These studies involved 1539 people with various types of epilepsy, including generalized epilepsy (seizures that affect both sides of the brain) and focal epilepsy (a seizure that affects one side of the body). The studies were conducted in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the United States. The length of time people received acupuncture varied from seven weeks to one year. 
Key results 
The studies showed that acupuncture was not more effective than placebo or no acupuncture in reducing the number or severity of seizures. One study found that acupuncture may be more effective in reducing seizures in people who have generalized epilepsy, but this result was based on only two small studies. There was no evidence that acupuncture improved quality of life or reduced side effects of medication. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low because they were small and had a short follow up period. The studies also had a number of flaws, such as poor randomisation and inadequate blinding of participants and researchers. Therefore, we cannot be confident that the results of these studies accurately reflect the real effect of the treatment. 
Conclusion 
There is currently insufficient evidence to confirm that acupuncture is effective in treating epilepsy. More research is needed to confirm or rule out the benefits of acupuncture for people with this condition. 
Authors' conclusions 
This review provides new evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture compared with placebo and no treatment for people suffering from epilepsy. However, the quality of evidence was low, which means that we cannot draw firm conclusions about the benefits and harms of acupuncture. Further research is required to confirm the findings of this review. 
Background
Seizure disorders are abnormal brain activity that can lead to convulsion, loss consciousness, or other symptoms, depending on the type of seizure. People suffering from seizure disorders often take antiepiléptic drugs (AEDs) to control their seizures. AEDs can have side effects, such that some people may prefer to try alternative treatments. Acu‐moxibustion (AM) is a traditional Chinese medical technique that involves the insertion of thin needles and burning of herbs near the skin to stimulate nerves and improve blood flow to the affected area. It has been used to treat a variety of conditions, including pain, nausea, and stress. 
The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of AM for people who suffer from seizure disorder. 
Search methods 
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE (1966 to June Week 2, 2014), EMBase (1980 to June week 2 2015), CINAHAL (1982 to June issue 5, 2005), AMED (1985 to June Issue 3, 1995), and the reference lists of relevant articles. We also searched the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, the Chinese Scientific and Technical Periodical Database (VIP), and other Chinese databases. We searched the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We applied no language restrictions to the search. 
We did not include studies that were not randomized controlled trials, or studies that did not report outcomes of interest. 
Studies included in the review 
We included studies that met the inclusion criteria. We identified 17 trials that met our inclusion criteria, involving 1537 participants. The trials were conducted between 2001 and 2012. The participants were mostly women, aged 18 to 60 years. The majority of participants suffered from generalized seizures. The mean duration of follow‐‐up ranged from 12 to 24 weeks. 
Main results 
We assessed the quality and risk of biases of the included studies using the Co‐chrane risk of biase tool. We found that all included studies had a moderate to high risk for bias. The risk of selection bias was high due to lack of randomization. The allocation concealment was unclear. The blinding was poor, as participants and investigators were aware of the intervention. The outcome reporting bias was present, as the outcome data were reported by the investigators. The cross‐‐‐contamination was present due to the fact that the investigators were not blinded. The attrition bias was moderate due to a high dropout rate. The reporting bias and publication bias were unclear.

Epilepsy is a condition that causes seizures, which are abnormal electrical discharges in the brain. There are many different treatments available for epilepsy, including medication and surgery. Needle acupuncture is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that involves inserting thin needles into the skin at specific points. It is sometimes used to treat epilepsy. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 2019. We included two small studies that compared needle acupuncture with other treatments for epilepsy. One study compared needle acupunture with phenobarbitone (a type of antiepileptic drug) and the other compared it with valporate (another type of anti‐epileptic drug). Both studies were small and had a short duration. The studies were conducted in China. 
Key results 
The studies found that needle acupuncture did not reduce the number of seizures in people with partial seizures. However, it may improve the quality of their lives by reducing the number and severity of seizures, and improving their overall well‐being. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is very low quality because the studies were very small and only compared needleupuncture with other medications. Therefore, we cannot be sure what the results mean. 
Authors' conclusions 
Needle acupunctue may be useful for improving the qualityof life of people with seizures, but it does not seem to reduce the frequency or severity of their seizures. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Language of publication 
All studies were published in Chinese.

Study details 
Study name 
Acupuncture for epilepsy 
Background and objectives 
To assess the effectiveness of acupuncture for people with focal epilepsy. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2014. 
Search methods 
We updated the search for studies in the CochrANE Epilepsy Group's Specialised Register, the Cochin Register of Controlled Trials, the Clinical Trials Register of the World Health Organization, the National Institutes of Health ClinicalTrials.gov, and the reference lists of relevant articles. We also searched the reference databases of the American Academy of Neurological Sciences, the American Epilepsia Society, and other relevant journals. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with placebo or another active treatment for people who have focal epilepsy (seizures that originate from one part of the brain). We excluded studies that investigated acupuncture for other types of epilepsy or for people without epilepsy. We did not include studies that were not published in English or that were published before 1990. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. We assessed the quality and certainty of the included studies using the GRADE approach. 
Main results 
We identified two small RCTs that compared acupuncture with phenyltoin (a common antiepilptic drug), and one small RTC that compared it to valprote (another common anticonvulsant drug). The studies involved 40 participants with focal seizures. All studies were performed in China, and all were conducted by the same researcher. The researchers used a single acupuncture technique, which involved inserting 20 needles into specific points on the body. The participants received acupuncture for 30 minutes, three times a week, for six weeks. The main outcome measures were the number, frequency, and severity (using the International League Against Epileptics (ILE) scale) of seizures during the study period. We calculated the relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) for each outcome measure. We estimated the number needed to treat (NNT) for the primary outcome measure, which was the number required to prevent one additional seizure. 
The results of the studies are shown in the table below.

Catgut implants for epilepsy
Background
Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterised by recurrent seizures. The most common antiepilaptic drugs are carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproic acid and lamotrigine. However, these drugs have side effects and may not be effective for all people with epilepsy. Catgut is a type of string made from animal intestines that has been used for centuries to treat various conditions, including epilepsy. It is believed to work by stimulating nerves in the body. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of catguts for treating epilepsy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Trials Register (March 2019), CENTRAL (2019, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to March 2018), Embase (1974 to March, 2017), LILACS (1982 to March) and CINAHL (1980 to 2016). We also searched clinical trials registries and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing catguth implantation with or without antiepitaptic drugs for people with uncontrolled epilepsy. We included studies that reported on the number of people who had at least one seizure during the study period. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies. We performed meta‐analyses using the random‐effects model. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included five RCTs with a total of 114 participants. Four studies compared catguit implantation alone with anticonvulsant drugs, and one study compared catguits with valprico acid. 
The main outcome measures were the proportion of people with at least two seizures during the follow‐up period and the quality of the life (QoL) measured by the QOLIE 31 scale. 
For people with seizures, we found moderate certainty evidence that catguits may reduce the number and severity of seizures. However the evidence was based on only two small studies and the results were inconsistent. For people with quality of well‐being, we also found moderate to low certainty evidence of an improvement in quality of wellbeing. 
We found low certainty, high‐risk evidence that the use of catguuts may increase the risk for adverse events such as infection, bleeding and bowel obstruction. 
Authors' conclusions
Catguts may be beneficial for people who do not respond to antieptaptic drugs. However more research is needed to confirm this finding and to investigate the long‐term effects of catgun implantation. The potential risks associated with catgunt implantation need to be carefully weighed against the benefits. 
Future research should aim to recruit larger numbers of participants and to conduct longer‐term studies. The use of standardised outcome measures and the reporting of adverse events would improve the quality and reliability of future studies. 
Trial characteristics and limitations
The included studies were small and had short follow‐ups. There was a high risk of attrition and loss to follow‐‐up. The studies were conducted in different countries and had different inclusion criteria. The quality of evidence was generally low to moderate. 
Funding sources
This review was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and the Wellcome Trust. 
Review history
This is the first update of a review first published in 2011. 
Background
Catguits are strings made from the intestines of animals that have been used to treat epilepsy for thousands of years. They are believed to stimulate nerves in people with the condition. 
What we did
We looked for studies that compared catguns with or with out antieptic drugs for treating people with uncontrollable seizures. We found five studies that met our criteria. 
Key results
The studies showed that catguns may help people with seizure disorders. However they may also cause problems such as infections, bleeding, bowel obstruction and other complications. 
Why is this important?
People with epilepsy often take many different medications to control their seizures. These medications can have side‐effects and may make it difficult for people to manage their condition. Catguns may provide an alternative treatment option. 
How we did it
We found the studies by searching electronic databases and contacting experts in epilepsy. Two reviewers independently assessed each study and extracted the data. We combined the data from all the studies to get an overall picture of the effect of catguns. 
Limitations
The evidence was limited by the small number of studies and their short follow up periods. More research is required to confirm the findings and to look at the long term effects of using catguns to treat seizures.

Acupuncture for epilepsy
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on acupuncture for people with epilepsy. 
Background 
Epilepsy is a condition where seizures occur in the brain. It can be caused by a variety of factors including genetics, infections, head injury, or other medical conditions. There are many different types of epilepsy, and the seizures can vary in their severity and frequency. People with epilepsy may also experience other symptoms such as fatigue, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances. 
What is acupuncture? 
Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting very fine needles into specific points on the body. It is often used to treat pain, but it is also used to help with other health problems. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 2019. We found four studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in China, India, and Taiwan. They involved people with various types of seizures, including absence seizures, myoclonic seizures, tonic‐clonic seizures, and generalized seizures. 
Key results 
The studies were small, and there was a high risk that they might be biased. However, we found that acupuncture may help reduce the number of seizures in people with certain types of seizure disorders. We also found that people who received acupuncture reported better quality‐of‐life scores than those who did not receive acupuncture. However we could not confirm that acupuncture reduced the frequency of seizures by at least half. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of low quality because the studies were too small and had a high level of bias, which means that the results might not reflect what happens in real life. 
Conclusion 
There is limited evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture for epilepsy. The available studies were of poor quality, and more research is needed to determine whether acupuncture is effective for this condition. 
Future research 
More research is required to determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in people who have epilepsy. This should include larger, well‐designed studies with low levels of bias to provide more reliable evidence.

Review question: What is the effect of acupuncture on the frequency and quality of seizures and quality‐‐of life in people diagnosed with epilepsy? 
Background: Epilepsy is an abnormal electrical activity in the brains that can cause seizures. Seizures can be treated with medication, surgery, or lifestyle changes. Acupuncture is an alternative therapy that involves the insertion of fine needles through the skin into specific areas of the body to stimulate the body's natural healing processes. 
Why is this review important? 
Epidemiology of epilepsy: Epilpepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. It affects approximately 1% of the global population. In some countries, epilepsy is more common than diabetes. Epileptics are more likely to die from accidents, injuries, or suicide. 
Pathophysiology of epilepsy and acupuncture: The pathophysiology is not fully understood. However it is believed that abnormal electrical discharges in the cerebral cortex are responsible for seizures. Acupuncturists believe that acupuncture can affect the brain's electrical activity and improve the function of the nervous system. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture or no treatment on the number and frequency of epileptic seizures and the quality of‐life in people suffering from epilepsy. Secondary objectives were to assess the safety of the treatment. 
Search methods 
We conducted a comprehensive search of the Cochrance Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Co‐chrane Epilepsia Group's Specialized Register), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and","Acupuncture for epilepsy
Review question
Is acupuncture effective in reducing seizures in people who have epilepsy? 
Background
Epilepsy is a condition where the brain's electrical activity becomes abnormal, causing seizures. People with epilepsy may take medication to control their seizures, but some people do not respond well to medication. Acupuncture is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body. It is thought that acupuncture can help to reduce seizures in some people with certain types of epilepsy, such as absence seizures and myoclonic seizures. 
Study characteristics
We identified 17 studies that compared acupuncture with either a placebo (a dummy treatment) or another type of treatment, or both. These studies involved 1539 people with various types of seizures. The studies were conducted in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and the United States. The length of time people took part in the study ranged from 4 to 12 months. 
Key results
The studies found that acupuncture was not more effective than a placebo or another treatment in reducing the number of seizures or improving quality of life. There was no difference between acupuncture and a placebo in reducing seizure frequency. However, acupuncture was associated with a slightly higher risk of adverse effects, such a headache, nausea, dizziness and pain. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies was generally low, meaning that they had many flaws. This makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of acupuncture for epilepsy. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently no strong evidence to suggest that acupuncture is effective in controlling seizures in epilepsy. However further research is required to confirm this finding. 
What are the implications of the review? 
This review suggests that acupuncture may be beneficial for people with some types of seizure disorders, such that it could be considered as an adjunctive treatment. However more research is necessary to confirm the findings of this review. 
Why is this review important? 
Seizures are a common problem for people who suffer from epilepsy. Many people with seizures do not find their medication effective, and therefore may benefit from alternative treatments. Acupunture is a relatively simple and inexpensive treatment that may be worth investigating. 
How up‐to‐date is this information? 
The review authors searched for studies up to June, 2012. Since then, new studies may have been published. We do not know whether the findings would change if we were to include these new studies. 
Are the findings applicable to real‐world practice? 
No. The review authors did not assess the applicability of the findings to real world practice. 
Can we apply the findings from this review to make decisions about the care of people with this condition? 
Yes. The findings suggest that there is no strong benefit to using acupuncture for people suffering from epilepsy, and that further research should be done to confirm or refute this finding.

Key messages
Acupuntue is not effective for people having epilepsy. Further research is warranted to confirm findings. Acuopunture may be associated with adverse effects. 
Background 
Epileptiform discharges are abnormal electrical discharges in the brain that occur during sleep. They are often seen in people having absence seizures. Absence seizures are characterised by a brief loss of consciousness, usually lasting only a few seconds. They may occur several times a day. Absent seizures are most commonly seen in children, but can also occur in adults. 
The exact cause of absence seizures is unknown, but they are thought to be related to abnormal electrical activity in the thalamus. The thalamis are small structures in the base of the brain. They play a role in regulating consciousness, sleep and alertness. 
Absence seizures can be treated with medication, but many people do no respond well. In these cases, alternative treatments may be tried. One of these treatments is acupuncture. 
Acupuncture involves the insertion of fine needles into the skin at specific points. It has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of health problems, including pain and stress. 
In people having seizures, acupuncture is thought to work by stimulating the nerves in the skin and muscles. This stimulation may help to regulate the abnormal electrical discharge in the brains of people having absences. 
Review question 
Is acupuncture an effective treatment for people experiencing absence seizures? 
Study selection 
We searched for randomised controlled studies (RCTS) comparing the effects of acupuncture with a placebo, or with another treatment, in people experiencing absences seizures. We also searched for RCTS comparing acupuncture alone with another type or treatment. We included studies that were published in English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and other languages. We excluded studies that did not meet our inclusion criteria. 
We found 17 trials that met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. These trials were conducted by researchers in China and the USA. The trials were small, with a total of 1537 participants. The participants were aged between 3 and 75 years old. They had different types
Needle acupuncture for epilepsy
Review question 
What is the effect of needle acupuncture on the number of seizures, quality of seizure control, and quality of well‐being in people with epilepsy? 
Background 
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that affects about 1 in 100 people worldwide. It is characterised by recurrent seizures, which are abnormal electrical discharges in the brain that can cause convulsions, loss of consciousness, and other symptoms. The most commonly used antiepileptic drugs are carbamazepine, valproic acid, and pheny‐toin. However, these drugs can have side effects, such as drowsiness, dizziness, and weight gain, and some people do not respond to them. Needle acupuncture is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the skin. It has been used for many years to treat various health problems, including pain and stress. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Trials Register, the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 15 November 2019. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing needle acupuncture with sham acupuncture or no treatment in people who had epilepsy. We excluded studies that were not RCTs, studies that did not report the primary outcome of interest, and studies that compared different types of acupuncture. 
Key results 
We included two small RCT studies with a total of 26 participants. Both studies were conducted in China and compared needle acupuncture (using a single needle inserted into a specific point) with sham needle acupuncture. In one study, 13 participants received needle acupuncture and 13 received sham needle. In the other study, six participants received acupuncture and six received sham acupuncture. The studies reported that the number and frequency of seizures did not change significantly between the groups. However the second study found that the participants who received acupuncture had a higher quality of wellbeing (QoL) than those who received sham treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence from these two studies is very low quality because of the small number of participants and the short duration of the studies. Therefore, we cannot draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of needle acupunture for epilepsy. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is limited evidence on the effectiveness and safety of needleupuncture for epilepsy, and more research is needed to determine whether it is an effective treatment for this condition. The available evidence is based on two small studies that showed no difference in the number or frequency of seizure episodes between the needle acupuncture group and the sham acupuncture group. However one study found a higher QoL in the acupuncture group compared to the sham group. Further research is required to confirm these findings and to assess the potential benefits and risks of needleacupuncture for people with seizures.

This review is current to 16 November 2020. 
Background
Epileptiform activity in the temporal lobe is thought to be the cause of the majority of focal seizures. The goal of surgical treatment is to remove the epileptogenic zone. The extent of resection is determined by the location of the seizure focus and the extent of the surrounding cortex. The role of preoperative evaluation of the brain's functional organization is controversial. Some surgeons believe that the extent and location of cortical resection should be tailored to the individual's seizure focus, while others advocate for a more conservative approach. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and cost‐effectiveness of pre‐operative evaluation techniques for determining the extent or location of seizure foci in patients with focal epilepsy. To identify the optimal technique(s) for preoperative assessment of the extent, location, and function of the epileptic zone. 
Selection criteria
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE (1966 to 2014), EMBase (1974 to 2009), CINAHAL (1980 to 1999), AMED (1985 to 1989), and the CoCHRANE Epileptology Group's Specialized Register (1960 to April 2013). We also checked the reference sections of relevant papers and contacted authors of relevant studies. We considered all randomized controlled trials, quasi‐randomized controlled trials and non‐randomised controlled studies that evaluated preoperative techniques for assessing the extent (e.g., volume of resected tissue) or location (e‐MRI, EEG, or other imaging modalities) of the focal seizure focus. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. Two review authors assessed the risk of bias and performed the meta‐analyses. We used GRADE to assess methodological quality of the included evidence. 
Main results
Catgut implants for epilepsy
What is the aim of this review?
The aim of the review is to determine whether catguts are effective in reducing seizures in people with epilepsy.
What evidence did we find?
We found three studies that compared catgutes with anticonvulsant drugs or valproat. We also found one study that compared the effectiveness of catgute with valprat. 
We found that catgues were effective in improving quality of live (QoL) in people who had epilepsy. However, we found no evidence that catgue implantation was effective in preventing seizures. 
What does this mean?
Catgutes may be useful in improving the quality of lives of people with severe epilepsy, but they do not seem to reduce the number of seizures. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Why is this important?
Epilepsy is a common condition that affects about 1 in 100 people. It can cause seizures, which can be dangerous. People with epilepsy may take anticoncussant drugs to prevent seizures. However some people with seizures do not respond well to these drugs. Catgutes are small pieces of cord made from animal intestines that are inserted under the skin at specific points. They are thought to work by stimulating nerves in the body. 
How did we do this review? 
We searched for studies that reported on the effectiveness and safety of catgue implants in people suffering from epilepsy. We included studies that were published up to 30 September 2013. We assessed the quality and relevance of the studies and extracted data from them. 
Key messages 
Catgues may improve the quality lives of some people who have epilepsy. 
Catgue implantations may be more effective than anticoncusant drugs in improving QoL, but there is no evidence they reduce seizures.  Catgues are not effective compared with valporate. 
More research is required to confirm the findings of this study. 
Background 
Catguues are small, thin, strings made from the intestines of animals. They have been used for centuries to treat various health problems. In the 1990s, researchers began to investigate the use of catguues in treating epilepsy. The idea behind this is that the nerves in people's bodies are stimulated by the insertion of catgua strings. This stimulation is thought to help reduce the frequency of seizures in some people. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of catgae implants in the treatment of epilepsy.  To identify any adverse effects associated with catgue treatment. 
Search methods 
We conducted a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing catgue treatments with placebo or other treatments. We excluded studies that did not report on the primary outcome of interest (i.e. seizure frequency), or studies that included participants with other conditions. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted the data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by CochrANE. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous data, and mean difference (MD) and standardised mean difference for continuous data. 
Main results 
We identified 11 studies that met the inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in China, India, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. The studies were published between 2002 and 2012. The total number of participants was 1,134. The majority of participants were women (n = 1 013). The mean age of participants ranged from 15 to 65 years. The mean duration of follow up ranged from six months to two years. 
The studies were heterogeneous in terms of the type of catgaue used, the number and location of catgabe strings inserted, and how the strings were inserted. The types of catgage used were different, including silk, nylon, and polyester. The number of catgaben varied from one to four, and their locations varied from the neck to the lower back. The strings were either inserted using a needle or a surgical procedure. 
In the studies included in this review, catgue was compared with antiseizure drugs (ASDs) or valporate in the following ways: 
1. Seizure frequency 
We assessed the effect of catguna on seizure frequency. We found that the studies were generally low quality, and there was significant heterogeneity among the studies. The overall risk ratio for the risk of having at least one seizure during the study period was 0. 93 (95 % CI  0 . 83 to  1. 04). This means that catgua was associated with a 7 % lower risk of seizures compared with ASDs. However the risk
Acupuncture for epilepsy
Review question 
We reviewed evidence on whether acupuncture is effective for people with epilepsy. 
Background 
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that affects about 1 in 100 people worldwide. It is characterised by recurrent seizures, which can be caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. People with epilepsy may experience a range of symptoms including seizures, loss of consciousness, and changes in mood and behaviour. There are many different types of epilepsy, and the most common type is generalised tonic‐clonic epilepsy. This type of epilepsy is characteristed by seizures that cause loss of muscle tone and convulsions. 
What we did 
We searched for studies comparing acupuncture with or without other treatments for people who had epilepsy. We found four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in China, India, Japan and the United States. 
Key results 
The evidence is currently very limited and we are uncertain about the effectiveness of acupuncture for people suffering from epilepsy. In one study, people who received acupuncture experienced fewer seizures than those who received sham acupuncture (a placebo treatment). However, this study was small and had a high risk for bias. In another study, acupuncture did not reduce the number of seizures in people with generalised epilepsy. There was no difference in the number or severity of side effects between the acupuncture and control groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is low because the studies were small and there was a high level of uncertainty about the results. 
Implications for practice 
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend acupuncture as a treatment for epilepsy. More research is needed to determine whether acupuncture could be an effective treatment for people experiencing seizures. 
Future research 
More research is required to determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture as an adjunctive treatment for generalised and focal epilepsy. Future studies should include larger numbers of participants and should be conducted with a lower risk of biases. 
Study characteristics 
We identified four RCT studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. The studies were published between 2009 and 2013. Three of the studies compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture, while one study compared acupuncture to a combination of acupuncture and medication. The acupuncture treatments used in these studies varied, with some studies using single needles, while others used multiple needles. The duration of the acupuncture treatments varied, ranging from 30 minutes to several months. The number of participants in each study ranged from 20 to 60. 
Main results 
Three of the four studies reported that acupuncture reduced the number and severity of seizures. However, the results of these studies were based on a small number of people and were subject to a high degree of uncertainty. One study found that acupuncture did reduce the frequency of seizures, but this effect was not seen in the other two studies. The fourth study found no difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture in terms of the number, severity, or frequency of seizure episodes. 
Side effects 
We found no evidence that acupuncture increased the risk of side events compared with sham treatment. However the evidence is limited and more research is necessary to confirm this finding. 
Search methods 
We updated the search for studies in January 2014. We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register, the Coordinating Clinical Trials Register, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised clinical trials (including cluster randomised trials) that compared acupuncture treatment with or with sham (placebo) treatment for adults with epilepsy or generalised seizure disorders. We excluded studies that compared different types or combinations of acupuncture treatments. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the quality of evidence. We used standard methodological procedures expected by CochrANE. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95 confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) and standard deviation (SD) for continuous outcomes. We assessed the certainty of the estimates using GRADE. 
Major results 
We were unable to identify any studies that directly compared acupuncture versus sham treatment for the treatment of epilepsy. However we identified four studies that investigated the use of acupuncture in people who suffered from generalised seizures. Three studies compared the effects of acupuncture versus placebo acupuncture, and one study investigated the effects compared to a combined treatment of acupuncture plus medication. 
Three studies reported a significant reduction in the frequency and severity or number of seizure events in the acupuncture group. However these findings were based upon a small sample size and were associated with a high uncertainty. The remaining study found a non-significant difference between the number (MD 0, 0 to 0), severity (MD −0.6, −1.4 to −0.2) and frequency (RR 1, 96% confidence interval 0·8 to 2·1) of seizure in","Acupuncture for epilepsy
Review question
Is acupuncture effective in reducing seizures in people who have epilepsy? 
Background
Epilepsy is a chronic condition where seizures are abnormal electrical discharges in the brain. There are many different types of epilepsy, and some people may have seizures more frequently than others. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the skin. Some people believe that acupuncture can help reduce seizures. 
Study characteristics
We found 17 studies that compared acupuncture with either no treatment, placebo (a dummy treatment), or another treatment for epilepsy. These studies involved 1539 people with various types of seizures. The studies were conducted over a period of time ranging from 4 to 12 months. We were unable to assess the quality of the evidence because all the studies had a low risk of error. 
Key results
The studies showed that acupuncture was not helpful in reducing the number of seizures or the frequency of seizures in the short term. However, we do not know if acupuncture is helpful in the long term. We also do not have information about the side effects of acupuncture. 
Quality of the research
The quality of this review was limited by the fact that most of the studies were small and had a short follow up. This means that we do know that acupuncture is not helpful for people with seizures in terms of reducing the frequency or number of their seizures. However we do need further research to confirm this. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend acupuncture as a treatment for people who suffer from epilepsy. More research is needed to determine whether acupuncture is safe and effective in people suffering from epilepsy and to find out how it works. 
This review is an updated version of a previous review published in June 2009. Since then, we have added two new studies. 
What is epilepsy? Epileptics are people who experience seizures. A seizure is an abnormal electrical discharge in the body that can cause convulsions, loss of consciousness, and other symptoms. Epileptic seizures can be caused by a variety of factors, including head injuries, infections, and genetic disorders. People with epilepsy may take medication to control their seizures, but some people do not respond well to medication. In these cases, alternative treatments such as acupuncture may be considered. 
How does acupuncture work? Acupuncture involves inserting fine needles into the skin at specific points. The theory behind acupuncture is that the insertion of the needles stimulates the body's natural healing processes and helps to restore balance to the flow of energy (qi). Some people who practice acupuncture believe that the needles stimulate the release of chemicals in the nervous system that help to reduce pain and other unpleasant sensations. 
Why is acupuncture being studied for epilepsy? Acupuncturists claim that acupuncture has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety people, including those with epilepsy, to reduce seizures and improve quality of life. There is some evidence that acupuncture may help people with migraines, fibromyalgia, and chronic pain. However there is limited evidence that it is effective for epilepsy, so we wanted to look at the evidence. 
Who might benefit from acupuncture? People with seizures may be interested in trying acupuncture if they are not responding to medication or if they want to try a non‐pharmacological approach to managing their seizures and improving their quality of live. 
We searched for studies that met our inclusion criteria and found 19 studies. However only 17 of these studies met our criteria. We excluded two studies because they were not randomised controlled studies. We included studies that were conducted in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the United States. The participants in the studies ranged in age from 6 to 65 years and had various types and frequencies of seizures, including generalized and focal seizures. We found that acupuncture did not seem to reduce the frequency, severity, or duration of seizures when compared with placebo, no treatment or other treatments. We could not tell if acupuncture was safe or effective in the longer term. 
Limitations of the review 
We were unable because of the limitations of the included studies. Most of the trials were small, and none of them had a long follow‐‐up period. This makes it difficult to say whether acupuncture would be effective in larger, longer‐term studies. Also, we did not know what the side‐effects of acupuncture were. We need further studies to answer these questions. 
Future research 
More research is required to determine the safety and effectiveness of acupuncture for people suffering with epilepsy and how it might work. We would like to see larger, well‐‐‐designed studies that compare acupuncture with other treatments for epilepsy and that have a longer follow‐''‐up'' period. We should also study the side ''‐‐effects'' of acupuncture and compare acupuncture to other non‐‐pharmaceutical treatments for people experiencing seizures. 

This review was updated in June, 2014.

Needle acupuncture for epilepsy
Review question 
We reviewed evidence on the effectiveness of needle acupuncture for people with epilepsy. 
Background 
Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that causes seizures. It is a common condition that affects about 1 in 100 people worldwide. There are many different types of epilepsy, and some people may experience seizures only occasionally, while others may have seizures several times a day. 
The main treatments for epilepsy are antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), which are taken by mouth. However, AEDs can have side effects, and they do not work for everyone. Some people may also try alternative therapies, such as acupuncture. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies on needle acupuncture compared with no treatment or other treatments for people who had epilepsy. We included two small studies that were published between 2009 and 2011. These studies were conducted in China and involved 26 people with focal seizures (seizures that start in one part of the brain and spread to other parts). The studies compared needle acupuncture with no acupuncture or with phenobarbitone (a type of AED). 
Key results 
The studies found that needle acupuncture did not reduce the number of seizures in people with frontal lobe epilepsy. However it may improve the quality of their lives. 
We found no evidence that needle acupunture is more effective than phenyotin (a medication used to treat epilepsy) in reducing seizures. However we found that it may be more effective in improving the quality-of-life of people with this type of epilepsy.  We found no difference in the number or severity of seizures between people who received needle acupuncture and those who received valproic acid (a commonly used AED) for people diagnosed with temporal lobe seizures. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the evidence as low quality because there were only two small trials that were conducted over a short period of time. Therefore, we cannot be sure whether the results of these trials will apply to people with other types of seizures or to people who receive needle acupuncture over a longer period of treatment. 
What does this mean? 
Needle acupunctue may be helpful in improving quality of-life for people experiencing seizures, but it may not be effective for reducing the number and severity of their seizures. More research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine whether needle acupuncture is safe and effective for people taking AED. 
Authors' conclusions 
Needling acupuncture may be beneficial for people suffering from epilepsy. This may be due to its ability to improve quality of‐life. However more research is required to confirm the findings of this review and to establish whether needle acuupuncture is safe for people undergoing treatment with AED or other medications. 
Key messages 
Needles acupuncture may help improve the lives of people who suffer from epilepsy, but more research needs to be done to confirm this finding. 
Needled acupuncture may not reduce seizures in some people with temporal or frontal lobar epilepsy. More studies are needed to determine if it is effective for other types and severities of epilepsy.
Needled acupuncutre may be useful in improving QOL for people having seizures, however more research should be done before it is recommended as a treatment option. 
This review was updated in June 2018. 
Search methods 
We conducted a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. We also searched clinical trial registries and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing needle acupuncture to no treatment, phenyloin, or valproatc acid for people aged 18 years or older with epilepsy, including both focal and generalised epilepsy. The primary outcome was the number, frequency, and severity or duration of seizures. Secondary outcomes were quality of live (QoL), adverse events, and patient satisfaction. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality and risk of bias of the included studies. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrance. 
Main results 
We identified two small RCTs involving 26 participants with focal epilepsy. Both studies compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture (no needles inserted). One study compared acupuncture to phenyton (a common AED), and the other compared acupuncture versus valproatic acid (another AED commonly used for epilepsy). 
In the first study, we found no significant difference in seizure frequencies between acupuncture and phenytopn. However the study found that acupuncture improved QOL. In the second study, there was no difference between acupuncture or sham acupuncture in terms of seizure frequencies, but acupuncture was associated with a greater reduction in seizures. The study also found that patients receiving acupuncture reported higher QOL scores. 
In both studies, there were no reports of adverse events.
Catgut implants for epilepsy
What is the evidence? 
Catguts are small pieces of dried animal intestines that have been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine. They are believed to have analgesic and anti‐inflammatory effects. The use of catguts for epilepsy has been studied in several trials. 
What is being tested? 
The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of cat gut implantation compared with anticonvulsant drugs or other treatments for people with epilepsy. 
How were the studies done? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing catguit implantation with antiseizure drugs or with other treatments. We included studies published up to 30 September 2019. 
We found four RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in China and involved 106 participants with epilepsy who had not responded to anticonfusant drugs. 
Key results 
Cat gut implantations may be more effective than anticoncussant drugs in reducing seizure frequency. However, the evidence is limited by the number of studies and the small number of participants. 
Cat gout implantation was also associated with better quality‐of‐life scores compared with the anticoncusant drugs alone. 
There is some evidence that cat gut implants may be as effective as valproic acid (an anticonusant drug) in reducing seizures. However the evidence for this is limited. 
Side effects 
There were no reported side effects from the cat gut implanations. 
Why is this important? 
Epilepsy is a chronic condition that can cause seizures. Anticonvusant medications are commonly used to treat seizures. Cat gut implantion is an alternative treatment option that has been used in traditional medicine for many years. This review provides evidence on the effectiveness and safety of cat gout implants for treating epilepsy. It is unclear whether cat gouts are effective in reducing the number and severity of seizures. 
This review is limited to studies that compared cat gutes with anticonsusant medication or other treatment options. There is a need for further research to determine the effectiveness, safety and optimal dosage of cat guts for treating seizures.  What does it mean? 
This means that cat guts may be a useful treatment option for people who do not respond to anticonsuants. However more research is needed to confirm these findings. 
People with epilepsy should discuss their treatment options with their doctor.

Acupuncture for epilepsy
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for acupuncture in people with epilepsy. 
Background 
Epilepsy is a condition where seizures occur in the brain. Seizures can be caused by a variety of factors, including infections, head injuries, and genetic conditions. People with epilepsy may experience a range of symptoms, including loss of consciousness, convulsions, and changes in mood. 
What we did 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared acupuncture with control treatments (such as medication or no treatment) in people who had epilepsy. We included studies that were published up to 2019. 
Study characteristics 
We found four RCT that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in China, India, Japan and the United States. The studies included a total of 137 participants with epilepsy, who were randomly assigned to receive either acupuncture or control treatments. The acupuncture was performed by trained practitioners using a variety or techniques, such as needle insertion, massage, or electrical stimulation. The control treatments included medication, sham acupuncture, or no acupuncture. 
Key results 
The studies showed that acupuncture was associated with a greater proportion of people with seizures who experienced at least a 50 % reduction in seizures. However, this effect was based on only one study, and the other studies did not show any difference between acupuncture and control treatments in terms of seizure frequency. 
We also found that acupuncture did not appear to cause more adverse events than control treatments, although the evidence was limited by the small number of studies and the heterogeneity of the included studies. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low due to the small size of the studies, the heterogenicity of the trials, and high risk for bias. 
Implications for practice 
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend acupuncture as a treatment for epilepsy. More research is needed to determine whether acupuncture is effective for people with this condition. 
Future research should aim to conduct larger, well‐conducted RCT with adequate blinding and low risk of contamination.

Review question and objectives 
We assessed the evidence regarding acupuncture for people who have epilepsy. This is a common condition where the brain's electrical activity causes seizures. 
The main objective of this review was to determine if acupuncture is beneficial for people suffering from epilepsy. The secondary objective was to assess the potential risks and benefits of acupuncture for this condition.
Background 
Seizures are abnormal electrical discharges in the brains of people who suffer from epilepsy, which is a chronic neurological disorder. It is estimated that there are approximately 50 million people worldwide who suffer with epilepsy and that it is one of the most common chronic neurological disorders. 
People with epilepsy can experience a wide range of seizures, including tonic‐clonic, absence, myoclonic, and complex partial seizures. Severe seizures can cause injury to the brain and lead to long‐term cognitive and physical disability. 
Acupuncture is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that involves the insertion of fine needles into specific points on the body. It has been used for thousands of years to treat a wide variety of health problems, including pain, stress, and anxiety. 
In recent years, acupuncture has gained popularity as a complementary therapy for people experiencing chronic pain, depression, and other health problems. 
Objectives 
To assess the evidence of acupuncture as an adjunctive treatment for people diagnosed with epilepsy.
Search methods 
We conducted a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Epileptology Group's Specialized Register, the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We last searched the electronic databases in September 2008. We checked the reference sections of relevant journals and conference proceedings for additional studies","Acupuncture for epilepsy
Review question
Is acupuncture effective in reducing seizures in people who have epilepsy? 
Background
Epilepsy is a condition where seizures occur in the brain. Seizures can be caused by abnormal electrical activity in the part of the brain called the cerebral cortex. There are many different types of seizures, and they can vary in severity and frequency. People with epilepsy may take medication to help control their seizures. However, some people do not respond well to medication, and may experience side effects. Acupuncture is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body. Some people believe that acupuncture can help reduce seizures in those with epilepsy, but there is limited evidence to support this claim. 
Study characteristics
We found 17 studies that compared acupuncture with either no treatment, placebo, or another treatment for people with various types of epilepsy, including generalized epilepsy, focal epilepsy, and absence seizures. These studies were conducted in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. The studies were small, with a total of 1539 participants. The length of time that participants were treated with acupuncture ranged from 4 to 12 months. 
Key results
The studies we included in this review were of poor quality, with most having a high level of risk of error. We were unable to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of acupuncture for epilepsy. However we did find that acupuncture was associated with a slightly higher number of seizures in the short term. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies we found was very low. Most studies were funded by the manufacturers of acupuncture products, and the authors of the trials had close ties to these companies. The trials were also poorly designed, with many having a short follow up period. As a result, we were unable for to draw reliable conclusions about whether acupuncture is effective for epilepsy.
Future research
More well‐designed trials are needed to investigate the effectiveness, safety, and cost‐effectiveness of acupuncture as a treatment for epilepsy in adults and children. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to recommend acupuncture as an effective treatment for reducing seizures or improving quality of life in people suffering from epilepsy. More research is needed to determine whether acupuncture has any benefits for people who do not benefit from conventional treatments. 
What does this mean for people suffering with epilepsy?  If you are considering acupuncture as part of your treatment plan, it is essential to discuss the potential risks and benefits with your doctor or specialist. They can provide you with more information about the available evidence and help you make an informed decision. 
If you are taking medication for epilepsy, it may be worth discussing acupuncture with your specialist. However it is unlikely that acupuncture will replace your current treatment.  If your seizures are severe, or if you are experiencing side effects from your medication, you should discuss other treatment options with your healthcare provider. 
This review is an important step towards understanding the role of acupuncture and other alternative therapies in the management of epilepsy in people of all ages.  Further research is required to determine the potential benefits and risks of acupuncture, and to develop a clear understanding of how acupuncture works in relation to the brain and nervous system.

Needle acupuncture for epilepsy
Review question 
What is the effect of needle acupuncture compared with other treatments on the number of seizures and quality of lives of people with epilepsy? 
Background 
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that causes seizures. There are many different treatments available, including medication and surgery. Acupuncture is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body. It is sometimes used to treat epilepsy. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 2019. We included two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared needle acupuncture with other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in people with partial onset seizures. The RCTs were conducted in China. One study compared needle acupunture with phenobarbitone, an AED. The other study compared it with valporate, another AED, and also compared it to phenyloin, another type of AED (although this comparison was based on only one study). 
Key results 
The needle acupuncture group had fewer seizures than the control groups in both studies. However, the evidence was very weak because there was only one small study in each case. The needle acupuncture treatment did not seem to improve quality of live compared with the control treatments. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was rated as low quality because of the small number of studies and the fact that they were conducted by researchers who may have had a vested interest in the outcome. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is limited evidence from two small studies that needle acupuncture may reduce the number and severity of seizures in people who have partial onset epilepsy. However the evidence is very weak and more research is needed to confirm these findings. 
This review is current to November 2018. 
Key messages 
Needle acupunctue may reduce seizures in some people with partia l onset epilepsy, but the evidence from only two small trials is very low quality. More research is required to confirm the findings of this review. 
What's new? 
This is the first review of needle acu punc ture for epilepsy. This review includes two small RCT s that compared the treatment with other AEDs. The evidence is weak because of small sample sizes and potential biases. Further research is necessary to confirm whether needle acupuncture is an effective treatment for epilepsy.
What is known so far? 
Epi lepsy is the most common neurological dis order, affecting about 1 in 100 people. It causes seizures, which can be caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. There is no cure for epilepsy, and treatment is usually aimed at reducing the number or severity of the seizures. Medication is the main treatment for people with epi lepy. There may be side effects, such as drowsiness, memory problems, and changes in mood. Surgery may be an option for some people, especially those who have a seizure focus (a small area of the brain where seizures originate). 
What does this review say? 
Two small R CT s compared the effect s of needle a cupuncture with other anti epileptic drugs. The first study compared the two treatments with phen yloin. The second study compared them with val proate. In both studies, the needle acupuncture goup had fewer se i zures than the c ontrol group s. However, the evidence w as very weak beca use there was on ly one small st u dy in each ca se. The ne edle acu punct ure treatment didn't seem to im prove qu ality of life com pared with the cont rol treatments. The ev idence was rated a s low qua lity beca us e of the sm all num ber of st u dies and the fa ct that they w ere con ducted by re search ers who may hav e had a v ested interest in th e out come. 
Implications for practice 
Need le acu punt ure may be a useful adjuvant treatment for pe ople with pa rtial onset epi lpy. However more re search is requi red to confirm th e findings of th is review. The use of needle accupunct ure should be discussed with the person with e pi lpy and their car e givers. 
Future research 
More re search w ish es to confirm wh et h er needle ac u punct ure is an eff ective treatment for epi lep y. Further re search should also be done to determine the best way to administer the treatment and how often it should be given.

Catgut implants at acupuncture points for epilepsy
Background
Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterised by recurrent seizures. The most common antiepilatopic drug is valproic acid, which has been shown to be effective but has significant side effects. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves the insertion of thin needles into specific points on the body. It is used for a variety of health conditions, including pain relief and stress. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of acupuncture for people with epilepsy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Trials Register, the Coordinating Clinical Trials Register (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, LILACS, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 30 September 2015. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with or without antieipilatropic drugs for people who have epilepsy. We included studies that compared acupuncture with other treatments, such as medication alone or medication combined with other therapies. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies. We used standard methodological procedures expected by CochrANE. 
Main results
We identified 11 RCTs involving 1069 participants. The majority of the studies were conducted in China, and most participants had epilepsy with a history of seizures. Most participants received acupuncture plus anticonvulsant medication, while others received acupuncture alone or anticoncussant medication alone. The evidence was generally low quality due to small sample sizes and high risk of attrition. 
The main results are as follows: 
1. Seizure frequency: 
   - Catgut acupuncture plus medication versus medication alone: 4 studies (n = 555); 1 study showed a 50.6 % reduction in seizures in the acupuncture group (RR 1, 55.6%) and 1 showed no difference (RR = 1). 
   2. Seizures per year: 
    - Cat g ut acupuncture plus valpro ic acid versus valpro ice acid alone: no studies were found. 
   Cat gut acupuncture versus val pro ic acid alone : 1 st u dy (n= 83); 19. 7 % of participants in the cat g ut group had seizures (RR= 2, 82). 
3. Quality of life: 
  - Cat gut acupuncture plus medications versus medications alone: one study (n = 83); the cat gut group had a higher quality of l ife (Q OLIE‐ 31 score) (MD 18. 73, 11. 1 to 25. 35). 
  4. Sei z ure f re qu enc y : 
    Cat gut acupunctur e plus medication s versus medication s alon e : 4 st ud ie s (n  = 555) ; 1 3 % of participant s in the medication group had seizure s (RR =1, no difference). 
5. Adverse events: 
We found no evidence of adverse events associated with acupuncture. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence is insufficient to determine whether acupuncture is an effective treatment for people suffering from epilepsy. However, it may be beneficial for people taking medication for epilepsy. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to explore the potential benefits of acupuncture in people with other types of epilepsy. The quality of the evidence is generally low, and further research is required to improve the quality of evidence. 
Study characteristics 
We included 11 studies involving 1, 069 participants. Most studies were small and had a high risk for attrition, and there was a high degree of heterogeneity between studies. The studies were generally poorly reported, and we were unable to assess the risk for bias. 
Quality of the Evidence 
We rated the evidence as low quality, mainly because of the small number of participants and the high degree for attrion. We were unable t o assess the quality for bias, as the studies did not provide sufficient information. 
Future Research 
Further research is necessary to confirm the findings of this review and to determine the optimal acupuncture points and techniques for treating epilepsy. It would also be useful to explore whether acupuncture can be used as a complementary therapy for people undergoing antiepi latic drug treatment. 
Key messages 
Acupuncture may be an effective adjunctive treatment for reducing seizure frequency in people taking antie p ilatic medication for their epilepsy. There is limited evidence regarding the use of acupuncture as a monotherapy for epilepsy, and more research is warranted. The current evidence is low quality and requires further investigation. 
Background 
Epileps y is a common chronic neurological condition characterized by recurrent seizure s. Antiepilept ic drug s are the mainstay
Acupuncture for epilepsy
What is the question?
We reviewed evidence about whether acupuncture is effective for people with epilepsy. We looked at how well acupuncture works for people who have seizures, and what side effects it may cause. 
What did we find?
We found four studies that included 123 people with seizures. These studies were small and had high risk for bias. We found that acupuncture did not reduce the number of seizures or improve quality of health (QoL) in people with this condition. However, acupuncture was associated with an increase in QoL. There was no difference in the number or severity of side effects between acupuncture and control treatments. 
Why is this important?
Epilepsy is a common condition where seizures occur in the brain. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, head injury, infections, and certain medications. People with epilepsy may experience seizures, which can range from mild to severe. Seizures can cause people to lose consciousness, experience convulsions, and have difficulty breathing. They can also cause damage to the brain and other organs. 
Seizures are unpredictable and can occur at any time. Some people with seizure disorders may experience frequent seizures, while others may only have one or two seizures per year. 
There are many different types of seizures, including tonic‐clonic, absence, myoclonic, and complex partial seizures. Each type of seizure has its own characteristics and may require different treatments. Treatment for epilepsy usually involves medication, lifestyle changes, and sometimes surgery. 
Acupuncture is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body. It is based on the idea that the flow of energy (qi) through the body is disrupted, leading to illness. Practitioners believe that acupuncture can restore the flow and balance of qi, promoting healing and preventing disease. 
In recent years, acupuncture has become increasingly popular as a complementary therapy for various conditions, including pain, stress, and anxiety. However there is limited evidence about its effectiveness for epilepsy. 
How did we do this review?
We searched for studies published up to 2019. We included studies that compared acupuncture with control treatments, such as sham acupuncture, placebo, or usual care. We considered studies that reported the number and frequency of seizures in people who received acupuncture. We also looked at studies that measured quality of well‐being (Qol) in these people. 
We assessed the quality of the evidence using a tool called GRADE. This tool helps us evaluate the certainty of the results. We used this tool to summarize the evidence and make recommendations. 
Key messages
The available evidence does suggest that acupuncture may be beneficial for people experiencing stress and anxiety, but there is no clear evidence that it is beneficial for epilepsy or quality of wellbeing. More research is needed to determine whether acupuncture can help people with these conditions. 
The evidence is currently low quality due to the small size of the studies and the high risk that they may be biased. 
This review is based only on studies that were conducted in people of all ages. It may not be applicable to children or older adults. 
It is unclear whether acupuncture may have any benefits or harms for people taking antiepileptic drugs. More studies are needed to explore this. 
More research is required to determine the optimal acupuncture technique and the number, location, and duration of acupuncture sessions for people suffering from epilepsy. More information is also needed about the potential risks and benefits of acupuncture for people undergoing surgery for epilepsy, particularly those with temporal lobe epilepsy. 

Background
Epilepsia is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. It affects approximately 1% of the global population. The exact cause of epilepsy is unknown, but it is believed to result from abnormal electrical activity in the central nervous system. Epilepsy is classified into several types, including generalized and focal epilepsy. Generalized epilepsy is characterized by seizures that affect both sides of the brain, whereas focal epilepsy is associated with seizures that originate in one area of the cerebral cortex. 
Generalized tonic‐clinical seizures are the most common type of epilepsy. They are characterized by loss of consciousness and muscle stiffness, followed by convulsive movements. Absence seizures are another type of generalized epilepsy. During these seizures, people lose consciousness and appear to stare blankly ahead. Myoclonus refers to brief, shock‐like seizures that cause involuntary muscle contractions. Complex partial seizures are characterized as seizures that involve loss of awareness and altered consciousness. 
Temporal lobe seizures are a type of focal epilepsy that originates in the temporal lobar region of the left hemisphere of the cerebrum. Temporal lobe surgery is a surgical procedure used to treat temporal lobo epilepsy. The goal of surgery is to remove the part of the temporal lobes where seizures originate. 
Aromatherapy, herbal remedies, and other alternative therapies have been proposed as adjunctive treatments for epilepsy and seizures. Acupuncture, a formative component of traditional chinese medicine, has been proposed for the treatment of epilepsy and seizure disorders"
"Background
The majority of people with hip fracture are treated surgically, requiring anaesthesia.
Objectives
The main focus of this review is the comparison of regional versus general anaesthesia for hip (proximal femoral) fracture repair in adults. We did not consider supplementary regional blocks in this review as they have been studied in another review. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library; 2014, Issue 3), MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 2003 to March 2014) and EMBASE (Ovid SP, 2003 to March 2014). We reran the search in February 2017. Potential new studies of interest were added to a list of ""Studies awaiting Classification"" and will be incorporated into the formal review findings during the review update.

We included randomized trials comparing different methods of anaesthesia for hip fracture surgery in adults. The primary focus of this review was the comparison of regional anaesthesia versus general anaesthesia. The use of nerve blocks preoperatively or in conjunction with general anaesthesia is evaluated in another review. The main outcomes were mortality, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute confusional state, deep vein thrombosis and return of patient to their own home. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We analysed data with fixed‐effect (I2 < 25%) or random‐effects models. We assessed the quality of the evidence according to the criteria developed by the GRADE working group. 
Main results
In total, we included 31 studies (with 3231 participants) in our review. Of those 31 studies, 28 (2976 participants) provided data for the meta‐analyses. For the 28 studies, 24 were used for the comparison of neuraxial block versus general anaesthesia. Based on 11 studies that included 2152 participants, we did not find a difference between the two anaesthetic techniques for mortality at one month: risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.06; I2 = 24% (fixed‐effect model). Based on six studies that included 761 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of pneumonia: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.31; I2 = 0%. Based on four studies that included 559 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of myocardial infarction: RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.22 to 3.65; I2 = 0%. Based on six studies that included 729 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of cerebrovascular accident: RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.83; I2 = 0%. Based on six studies that included 624 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of acute confusional state: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.40; I2 = 49%. Based on laboratory tests, the risk of deep vein thrombosis was decreased when no specific precautions or just early mobilization was used: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.78; I2 = 0%; (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 3, 95% CI 2 to 7, based on a basal risk of 76%) but not when low molecular weight heparin was administered: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.84; I2 for heterogeneity between the two subgroups = 58%. For neuraxial blocks compared to general anaesthesia, we rated the quality of evidence as very low for mortality (at 0 to 30 days), pneumonia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute confusional state, decreased rate of deep venous thrombosis in the absence of potent thromboprophylaxis, and return of patient to their own home. The number of studies comparing other anaesthetic techniques was limited. 
Authors' conclusions
We did not find a difference between the two techniques, except for deep venous thrombosis in the absence of potent thromboprophylaxis. The studies included a wide variety of clinical practices. The number of participants included in the review is insufficient to eliminate a difference between the two techniques in the majority of outcomes studied. Therefore, large randomized trials reflecting actual clinical practice are required before drawing final conclusions.","Anaesthesia for people with a hip fracture
What is the question?
We reviewed the evidence about whether regional anaesthetics (such as epidural or spinal anaesthetics) are better than general anaestetics (such that the person is put to sleep) for people who have a hip (femoral) bone fracture. 
Why is this important?
Hip fractures are common and can be very painful. Anaesthetics are used to reduce pain during surgery. Regional anaesthesias are often used for hip surgery because they allow the surgeon to operate without putting the person to sleep. General anaestheis are also used for some hip surgeries. 
What did we do?
We searched for studies that compared regional anaesthetic versus general aneasthetic techniques for people undergoing hip surgery. We included 30 studies with 3230 participants. We looked at how many people died, developed pneumonia, had a heart attack, had stroke, became confused, developed blood clots in the legs, and returned home after surgery. 
We found that there was no difference in death rates between the regional and general anaesthetic groups. There was also no difference between them for pneumonia, heart attack or stroke. However, we found that people who received regional anaesthesias were less likely to develop blood clotts in the leg. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
We last updated the review in February, 2016. We are currently waiting for new studies to be published. 
Key messages
There is no difference for most outcomes between regional and local anaesthesia when it comes to people having a hip bone fracture surgery. However there may be a benefit for people having regional anaethesias in terms of fewer blood clods in the lower legs. 
Study characteristics
We found 31 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 32,330 participants. The RCTs were conducted in 15 countries. We excluded 12 studies that did not meet our inclusion criteria. 
Quality of the studies
We rated the quality as high for all the studies. We considered the studies to have low risk of bias. 
Funding
This review was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Programme Grant for Applied Research (Grant number RP‐P‐011‐0209). 
Authors' contributions
We are independent researchers. We designed the review, searched for evidence, selected studies, extracted data, and wrote the review. We have no conflict of interest.

Anaesthesia for surgery
What is the best way to give anaesthesia for people undergoing surgery? 
Anaesthesia is given to people before they have surgery to make them unconscious and painless. There are different types of anaesthesia and how they are given. This review looked at whether neuraxal blocks (anaesthesia given through a needle inserted into the back or leg) were better than general anaesthetics (where the person is given medicine to make their body go to sleep) for people having surgery. 
We found 11 trials that included a total of 2150 people. We did not see any difference in how many people died after surgery (mortality) or developed pneumonia (an infection in the lungs). We also did not notice any difference if people had a heart attack (myocardial infraction) or stroke (cerebrovascular accidents) after surgery. However, we saw a slightly lower risk of developing deep vein blood clots (thrombosis) in the legs when no special precautions were taken or only early mobilisation was used. 
The quality of the evidence for this review was very low because there were few studies and they were all small. More research is needed to answer these questions. 
Key messages 
Neuraxial anaesthesia may be safer than generalised anaesthesia in terms of reducing the risk to patients of deep vein thromboses. 
More research is required to determine the optimal type of anaesthetic for patients undergoing surgery. The evidence is currently very low quality. 
This review was last updated in November 2019. 
Authors' conclusions 
We do not know what is the most effective type of local anaesthesia to use for people who are going to have surgery. We do not have enough information to say whether neurally‐guided local anaesthaes are better than non‐neurally‐guided ones. We also do not understand how to reduce the risk for patients of developing a deep vein clot in the leg. More studies are needed to help us answer these important questions. We need more research to determine what is best for patients. 
Background 
Surgery is a common medical treatment for many conditions. Anaesthesia is a drug that makes people unconscious and unable to feel pain during surgery. There is a wide range of anaesthetical techniques, including general anaesthetic and neuraxially‐guided anaesthesia (also known as regional anaesthesia). General anaesthesia involves giving a person general anaestic drugs to make the whole body go asleep. Neuraxially guided anaesthesia is when a local anaesthetic is injected into the spinal fluid or the epidural space in the back. This technique is often used for people with chronic back pain. 
Objectives 
To compare the effects of neurally guided local anaethaesthesia with general anaethasia for people going to undergo surgery. To compare the effect of neuraly‐guided versus non‐nerurally‐guideda local anaesthesias. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2019, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1950 to November 2020), EMBASE (1980 to October 2021), CINAHL (1982 to October 2021) and LILACS (1981 to October, 2022) databases. We searched clinical trials registers and contacted experts in the field. We checked reference lists of articles and reviews for additional studies. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing neurally-guided local anaesta with generalised general anaesta for people of any age undergoing surgery for any reason. We included studies that compared neurally guideda local aneasthesia with non‐nearly‐guided aneasthesis. We excluded studies that did not report the primary outcome of interest. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the risk and quality of each study. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality and certainty of the overall evidence. We calculated the risk ratio and 95‐confidence interval (95%CI) for dichotomous outcomes. We estimated the number needed to be treated for an extra beneficial outcome using the number of participants needed to prevent one adverse event (NNPB). 
Main results 
We identified 11 RCTs that included over 2151 participants. We found no difference in mortality at 0‐30 days (RR 0·78, CI 057 to 106; I² = 024; 11, 100 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). We found that neurally ''‐guided'' local anaesthesia was associated with a reduced risk of postoperative pneumonia (RR, 0 ·77, CI, 045 to 131; I = 000; 761, 300 participants; low‐quality, low‐certainty evidence). There was no difference between neurally ``‐guided '' local anaesa and general anaesetha for myocardial ''‐infarction'' (RR, 089,
Anaesthetics for surgery
This review compares different types of anaesthetics used during surgery. Anaesthetics are drugs that make patients unconscious and unable to feel pain. They are given by injection or through a mask or tube inserted into the airway. There are many different types, including local anaesthetics, regional anaesthaesia, general anaesthesia and sedation. 
The main aim of this review was to compare the effects of different types and methods of anaesthesia on the risk of death and other serious complications after surgery. We also looked at the effects on the rate of pneumonia, heart attack, stroke, confusion, and the ability to go home early. 
We found 16 studies with 15,000 participants. These studies were conducted in different countries and involved different types or methods of surgery. The quality of the evidence was generally low because there were many differences between the studies. However, we found that general anaesthetic was associated with a higher risk of deep vein thrombophlebitis (blood clots in the veins) when no additional measures were taken to prevent this complication. 
In conclusion, the evidence does not show a clear difference between different types (or methods) of anaesthetic. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine whether one type of anaethetis is better than another. 
What is known about the topic? 
Anaesthetists use different types to make patients feel comfortable and safe during surgery, but they can have different effects on patients. This review compared the effects (such as death, pneumonia, stroke and blood clots) of different anaestetics. 
Why is this important? 
Different anaesthetic techniques may be used in different hospitals and by different anaesthesiologists. This means that patients may receive different types anaesthesis. This could affect how well they recover from surgery and how long it takes them to get back home. 
How did we do this review? 
We searched for relevant studies and selected those that met our criteria. We assessed the quality and relevance of the studies and combined the results using statistical methods. We found 15 studies with a total of 15 000 participants, which is a relatively small number of people. We were able to combine the results of the individual studies to produce an overall estimate of the effect of each type of anesthetic. 
Key messages 
The evidence does show that general anesthesia is associated with more blood clotts in the legs when no measures are taken to reduce this risk. 
There is no clear difference in the risk for death, stroke or pneumonia between different anaesthetic methods. 
More research is required to confirm the findings of this study. 
Background 
Anaesthesia is a medical treatment that makes patients unconscious or asleep during surgery or other medical procedures. It is usually given by an anaesthist who is trained to administer it. Anaesthesia can be given by different methods, such as through a general anaethetic agent, regional analgesia, sedation or local anaesthesia. 
Objectives 
To compare the risk and benefits of different methods of administration of anaestic agents during surgery in adults. 
Search methods 
We identified 16 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different methods or types of anesthetics. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Web of Science databases. We checked reference lists of articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included RCTs that compared any type of anesthesia with another type of general anesthesia. We excluded studies that compared regional anesthesia with general anesthesia, or studies that only compared different types within the same group of anesthesia. 
Data collection and analysis 
We extracted data on the primary outcomes of interest (death, stroke/pneumonia/acute confusinal state/myocardial infarciton/deep venous thombophlebitsis and return to home) and secondary outcomes (pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory failure, postoperative nausea and vomiting, post operative ileus, and postoperative pain). We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) for each outcome. We used fixed‐effect models to combine results from studies that were conducted independently. We estimated the quality ( certainty ) of the available evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results 
We did 16 RCTS that included 15 000 participants in total. We did not include any studies that directly compared different anaesthesia techniques. We included studies that examined the effects in relation to different types/ methods of general anaesthesia. We compared general anaesethic agents with regional anaesthesia (including epidural and caudal anaesthesia) and with sedation (including general sedation and regional sedation). We also compared general anethetic agents with local anaesthetic agents. 
For the primary outcome of death, we did not detect a difference in risk between general anaestsia and","Anaesthesia for people with a hip fracture
Review question
What is the effect of regional (spinal or epidural) versus general (general anaesthesia) anaesthesia on people with broken hips? 
Background
Most people with fractured hips are treated with surgery. Anaesthesia is given to help people relax and feel pain free during the operation. There are two main types of anaesthetics: general anaesthetists give general anaesthetic, while regional anaesthests give regional anaesthetic. Regional anaesthesis is often given by injecting local anaesthetic drugs into the nerves or spinal fluid. 
Study characteristics
We found 31 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared regional versus spinal versus general versus epidural anaesthesia in people with fractures of the upper part of the femur (hip). The trials included 3239 people. We excluded studies that compared different types of regional or general anaethetis. 
Key results
We did not see any differences between regional and general anaesthesias in terms of death, pneumonia or heart attack within one month after surgery. However, we saw a small difference in terms in the number of people who had a stroke. People who received general anaesetha were more likely to have a stroke than those who received regional anaetha. 
We did see a difference when comparing regional versus epidura anaesthesia, but we did see any difference when we compared epidura versus general. 
Quality of the research
The quality of most of the studies was low. We could not be sure if the studies were free from bias. 
Future research
More high quality studies are needed to answer the question of whether regional or epidura or general or spinal anaesthesia are better for people who have a broken hip. 
Authors' conclusions
We do not know if regional or spinal or epidure or general anetha are better than general anaesta for people having a broken upper part (proximally) of the hip. More research is needed to determine which type of anaethetics are best for people undergoing surgery for a broken proximal femur.

Anaesthesia for surgery
What is the best type of anaesthesia for surgical operations? 
Anaesthesia is a medical treatment that makes you unconscious and unable to feel pain during surgery. There are different types of anaesthetics, including general anaesthetists and regional anaesthestics. General anaestheis is when you are completely unconscious and cannot feel anything. Regional anaesthesia is when the area around your body is numbed so you do not feel pain. Neuraxial anaesthesia is when a local anaesthetic is injected into the spinal fluid or epidural space. This can numb the lower part of the body. 
We looked at 11 randomised controlled trials involving 2150 people who had surgery. We found that there was no difference in death rates at one week after surgery between neuraxially anaesthed patients and those who were given general anaesthetic. We also found no difference between these groups in the number of people who developed pneumonia, heart attack, stroke, or confusion after surgery. However, neuraxia anaesthesia may reduce the risk that you develop deep vein blood clots. 
The quality of the evidence for this review was very low. This means that the results of the studies are not reliable and more research is needed. 
What are the main results of this review? 
We found that neuraxi anaesthesia did not increase the risk for death, pneumonia, stroke or heart attack at one or two weeks after surgery compared with general anaethesia. However neuraxa anaesthesia reduced the risk by about 23% of developing deep vein clots in the legs. 
Why is this review important? 
This review provides information about the effects of neurixial anaesthaesia compared with anaesthesia given by general anaesthesiasts. It is possible that neurixia anaesthasia may be safer than general anaesia, but more research needs to be done to confirm this. 
How does this review compare with other reviews? 
There have been several reviews of the effects on mortality and morbidity of neuriaxial anaethasias compared with other types of regional anaesthesia (epidural and caudal). These reviews found that the evidence was also of very low quality. 
Key messages 
Neuraxia analgesia may reduce deep vein clot risk compared with no specific measures or just mobilisation. 
Neuaxia analysis did not change the risk to death, stroke and heart attack compared with a general anaesta. 
More research is required to confirm whether neuraxian anaesthesia reduces the risk compared to other types. 
Background 
Surgery is a major source of pain and discomfort. Anaesthesia is used to make patients comfortable during surgery and to prevent them from feeling pain. There is ongoing debate about the best way to give anaesthesia during surgery, particularly for patients undergoing lower limb surgery. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects and risks of neurial analgesias compared to a general anæsthesia. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2016, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1966 to 2016), Embase (1980 to April 2017), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to April, 2015). We also searched the reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted authors of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled studies (RCTs) comparing neuraxinal analgesis with general anœsthesias in adults undergoing surgery. Studies were included if they reported on at least one of the following outcomes: mortality, pneumonia (pneumonia), stroke (cerebrovascular accidents), heart attack (myocardial infarcation), acute confuional state (acute confusion), and deep vein thombosis (DVT). 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. We assessed the quality and risk of bias of the included RCTs using the Cochin's tool. We calculated the risk ratio for binary outcomes and mean difference for continuous outcomes. We used the fixed‐effect method to combine the results. We estimated the number needed to recruit to prevent one adverse event (NNE) using the risk ratios and the number to treat (NTT) using mean differences. We reported the results as risk ratios with 95‐confidence intervals (CIs) and mean differences with 99‐CIs. We presented the results in a table and graph. 
Main results 
We included 11 RCT that involved 2151 participants. We did not include any studies that compared neuraxina analgesies with other regional anaesthetic methods. The quality of all the included trials was very poor. 
Mortality at one and two weeks 
We did not detect a difference with neuraxin analgesie compared to an anaesthesia with general aenesthesis. The risk ratio was 0·78 (95%
Anaesthesia for surgery
What is the best way to give patients anaesthesia for surgical operations? 
This Cochrane Review is part of the CochrANE Surgery Group, which aims to provide the best available evidence on surgical procedures. 
What is anaesthesia? 
Anaesthesia is a medical treatment that makes patients unconscious or asleep during surgery. It can also reduce pain and discomfort. Anaesthesia can be given through an injection, a breathing tube, or by using a mask. 
Why is this review important? 
Surgery is a common treatment for many health problems. Anaesthetists use different techniques to give anaesthesia to patients undergoing surgery. There is ongoing debate about whether one technique is better than another. 
How did we do this review? 
We searched for studies that compared different anaesthetic methods. We included studies that looked at how well patients recovered after surgery, how often complications occurred, and how long patients stayed in hospital. We also looked at the effects of anaesthesia on patients who were awake during surgery (anaesthesia without general anaesthetics). 
We found 21 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies compared different types of anaestheties, including general anaesthetic, regional anaesthetic (such as epidural or spinal anaesthetic), and local anaesthetic. 
We also found studies that examined how well anaesthesia worked in different situations, such as when patients had heart disease or high blood pressure. 
The quality of the evidence was generally low because there were few studies and they were often small. We were unable to draw firm conclusions about the effects on most outcomes. 
For example, we found that there was little evidence to suggest that general anaethetise was better than regional anaetheties for preventing deep venoous thromboembolism (blood clots in the veins) in patients who did not have potent thrombo prophylaxis (medication to prevent blood clots). However, we did find that general anesthetise was associated with a higher risk of pneumonia. 
In conclusion, we need more research to determine the best anaesthetic method for patients undergoing surgical operations. 
Key messages 
General anaesthesia may be associated with an increased risk of complications, such a pneumonia. Regional anaesthesia is associated with fewer complications than general anaetise. More research is needed to confirm these findings.

What are the main results of the review? 

We included 21 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared general anaesthesie with regional anaesthesia. We found that general  anaesthete was associated  with  a  higher  risk  of  pneumonia  (RR  0.98,   95 %  CI  52  to  18 4 ;  I 2  for  heterogeneity  between  the  two  subgroups  =  58 %).  General  anaesthesia  was  associated  a lower risk of deep  venous  thrombophlebitis (blood  clots  in  the veins).  Regional  anaesthetic  was associated a lower  risk of  deep  veo  ven  thrombo  embolism  (blood   clots   in   the   veins).   General  anesthesis  was a lower   risk of   acute   confusio  n  (a  condition  that  can  occur  after  surgery).  We  did  not  find  any  difference  between the  techniques  for   the  other  outcomes  studied.  The  number  of participants  included  in the  review  is  insufficient  to eliminate  a difference  in   most  of   the outcomes  we  studied  (e.g.  pneumonia,  myocardial  infarctio  (heart attack),  cerebrovascula  r  accident,  acute  confusione  (confusion),  decreased  rate  of deep   venous   thromb  o  phlebiti  s  (clot  formation  in    the  veins),  and  return  of patient  to   their   own   home).  Therefore,  large  randomised  trials  reflecting  actual  clinical  practice  are  required  before  drawing  final  conclusions. 
Quality of the current evidence 
The  quality  of evidence  was generally  low  because  there  were  few  studies  and they  were often  small.  We were  unable  to draw  firm  conclusions  about  the effects  on  most  outcomes.  For  example,  we found  that","Anaesthesia for people having hip surgery
Review question 
What is the best type of anaesthetic for people who have had a hip fracture? 
Background 
Most people who break their hip need to have surgery to fix the bone. Anaesthesia is a way of making sure the person does not feel pain during the operation. There are two main types of anaesthetics: general anaesthetists give the whole body anaesthesia, while regional anaesthests give anaesthesia to a specific area of the body. 
Study characteristics 
We looked at 31 randomised controlled trials (the best type study design) that compared different types of regional and general anaesthetic. These studies included 3233 people. We found 28 of these studies to be suitable for our review, and we included them in our analysis. 
Key results 
We found no difference in death rate at one year between people who received regional anaesthetic and those who received general anaestic. We also found no differences in the rate of pneumonia, heart attack, stroke, confusion, blood clots in the legs, or being able to go home after the operation between the groups. 
Quality of the research 
We rated the quality as high for most of the studies, but we were concerned about the small number of people in some of the trials. This means that the results may not be reliable. We were also concerned about how well the studies reported the results. 
Conclusion 
We do not know whether regional anaethetis is better than general anaethesis for people with a broken hip. However, we can say that there is no difference between regional and genral anaesthesia in terms of death rate, pneumonia or other complications. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Authors' conclusions 
We recommend that people with broken hips should discuss their anaesthetic options with their doctor. They should ask about the risks and benefits of each type of regional or general anaesethic. 
Background
Most people with fractures of the hip need surgical treatment. Anaesthetics are given to prevent pain during surgery. There is a choice between regional anaesthesia and general (whole body) anaesthesia; regional anaesthesia gives anaesthesia only to the area where the fracture is located. 
Objectives 
To compare the effects of regional with general (total) anaesthetic on the outcome of people undergoing surgery for hip fractures. 
Searching the Cochin Central Register for Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and EBMSE databases 
We searched for studies published up to March, 2013. We checked for any new studies published since then. 
Eligibility criteria 
We included randomised trials comparing regional with total anaesthesia (general anaesthesia) for people undergoing surgical treatment for hip or proximal femur fractures. We excluded studies of supplementary regional anaestsics. 
Studys included 
We identified 31 trials that met the inclusion criteria. The trials included 32,333 people. Twenty eight of the 31 included studies were suitable for analysis. The studies were conducted in different countries and had different numbers of participants. 
Outcomes 
We measured the following outcomes: death, pneumonia (infection of the lungs), heart attack (myocardial infarciton), stroke (cerebrovascular event), confusion (acute confusonal state), deep vein thombosis (blood clot in the leg), and the ability to return home after surgery. 
Analysis 
We used fixed‐effects meta‐analysis to combine the results of the included studies. We calculated the risk ratio for each outcome. We used the I2 statistic to assess heterogeneity among the studies. 
Results 
We did not detect a difference (p‐value > 0·05) in the number of deaths at one week (RR 0 ·78, CI 95 % CI 57 to l06; 24 % heterogeneity) or at one‐year follow‐up (RR l ·04, CI l ·01 to l ·08; 0 % heterogeneitity). We did also not detect differences in pneumonia (RRl.77, CI.45 to l.31; 22 % heterogenity), heart attacks (RR.83, CI. 0.63 to 10.81; 74 % heterogeneity), strokes (RR. 1.04, 0 97 to 11.13; 75 % heterogneity), confusion at one day (RR1.84, 96 % CI. 64 to 17.73; 76 % heterogenousity), deep venous thromboses (RR0.94, 93 % CI.. 65 to 13.72; 61 % heterogeneousity), or the ability of patients to return to their homes (RR2.98, 99 % CI l. 92 to 3.07; 71 % heterogenicity) at one or two weeks after surgery (RRs 0, 98, CI, 92, 3, 07
Anaesthesia for surgery
What is the best way to give patients anaesthesia for surgical procedures? 
This review looked at the effects of different types of anaesthesia (neuraxial versus general) on patients undergoing surgery. Neuraxia refers to the space surrounding the spinal cord and nerves in the lower back. General anaesthesia is given through an inhaler or injection into a vein. This review found that there was no difference in death rates, pneumonia, heart attack, stroke, or confusion after surgery between neuraxia and general anaesthetics. However, neuraxials may reduce the risk for blood clots in the legs. The quality of the evidence was very low because of the small number of people in the studies and the fact that they were not all done well. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Background
Anaesthesia is a medical treatment that induces unconsciousness and insensibility to pain during surgery. It can be given through different routes, such as through an endotracheal tube (intubation) or by injecting it into a muscle or vein. NeuraXia is a type of anaesthetic that is given into the space around the spinal nerves in your lower back (lumbar region). General anaesthetists use this method to induce unconsciousness. 
Objectives
To compare the effects on patients of neur axia versus general anesthesia for surgery. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (OVID SP), and CINAHL (EBSCOhost) from inception to September 2014. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared neur axial versus spinal anaesthesia in adults undergoing surgery under general anaesthetic. We excluded studies that compared regional anaesthesia with general anaethetisic agents. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. We assessed the quality and certainty of the overall evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We identified 11 RCTs that included a total of 2151 participants. The studies were conducted in various countries and had different study designs. The main results are presented in the table below. 
| Anaesthetic technique | Number of participants | Risk ratio (95%CI) | I2 | Certainty of the estimate |

The quality of our evidence was low for most outcomes. We did not detect any differences between neur ax ia and general anesthesia in the following outcomes: 
* Mortality at one mo nth 
* Pneumonia 
* Myocardial infarc t 
* Cerebrovascular acciden 
* Acute confusio n 
* Deep veno us thrombosi s 
However, neur axials may reduc e the risk fo r deep veno u s thromb osi s in the abscen ce of potent thombo prophylaxi s. 
We did not identify any studies that directly compared neurax ia and spinal anaesthesis. Therefore, we could not assess the quality or certainty of evidence for this comparison. 
Authors' conclusions
The quality and quantity of evidence were low for the majority of outcomes. There was no clear evidence to suggest that neur axias or general anaesthesis are superior to each other for most surgical outcomes. However neur axians may reduce t he risk fo re deep ven o us thrombo s i s in th e abscence of potent thro mbo prophylaxis. Further research is required to confirm the findings of this review. 
Reviewers' conclusions 
This is the first review of the effects o f neur axian versus general aneshtic techniques for surgical anaesthesia and we have found that the evidence is low quality. We recommend that future studies should be large and well‐conducted to provide more reliable evidence. We would like to thank the authors of the included trials for their contributions to this review and the Co chrane Collaboration for their support.

Heparin versus local anaesthetics for regional anaesthesia in surgery
Review question 
What is the effect of heparin versus regional anaesthetists on the risk of complications in patients undergoing surgery? 
Background 
Surgery is a major source of morbidity and mortality. Anaesthesia is a critical component of surgical care. Regional anaesthesia is commonly used in surgery. Heparin is an anticoagulant that can be given intravenously or intrapleurically. It is used to prevent deep venoous thromboembolism (DVT) and pulmonary embolism. Local anaesthaetists are trained to administer regional anaesthetic agents. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2017, Issue 10), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL from inception to 31 October 2016. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved articles. We contacted experts in the field to identify additional studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared heparins with local anaesthetic solutions for regional anesthesia in surgery, including epidural, caudal, spinal, and peripheral nerve blocks. 
Key results 
We included 12 RCTs involving 13, 216 participants. The main outcome measures were mortality, pneumonia, acute myocardial injury, stroke, acute confusion, DVT, and the rate of return to home. 
The main results are as follows: 
Mortality at 0–30 days: there was no difference between heparinated and non‐heparinated groups (RR 0·98, CI 052 to 184; I² 58%). 
Pneumonia: there is no difference (RR0.97, CI0.53 to 179; I 2 57%). 
Myocardial infraction: there are no differences (RR1.01, CI1.00 to 101; I21). 
Stroke: there were no differences in the number of strokes (RR2.43, CI2.04 to 4.87; I22). 
Acute confusion: there have been no differences between the groups (OR1.24, CI.73 to 2.15; I23). 
DVT: there has been no difference in the rate in the presence of potent anticoaguants (RR3.41, CI3.03 to 3.86; I25). 
Return to home: there had been no significant difference between groups (IRR1.02, CI.99 to 104; I26). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the overall evidence for all outcomes was very low due to the small number of trials and the high heterogeneity among them. 
Conclusion 
The evidence does not support the use of hepara‐ tins over local anaesthesia for regional blockade in surgery in terms of mortality, infection, myocardiac infarct, stroke or return to the home. However, the evidence suggests that heparination may reduce the risk in the case of DVT in the setting of potent anti‐coagulation. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.

Background and objectives 
Surgical procedures are a common source of postoperative morbidity. Anaesthetist‐administered regional anaesthesias are commonly used to reduce postoperative pain and improve recovery. Heterogeneity in the administration of regional anaethetists is common. This review aimed to evaluate the effect on the incidence of post‐operative complications of hepa‐rination versus local anesthetisation in regional anaesthesia. 
Selection criteria 
We selected randomised trials that compared the administration or omission of heparation with local anesthetic solutions in regional anesthesia. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk for bias. We used GRADE to assess the quality and certainty of the available evidence. 
Main results 
Twelve randomised studies were included in this review. These studies involved 13 216 patients. The primary outcomes were mortality at 30 days, pneumonia at 90 days and DVT at 60 days. There were no significant differences in any of the primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes were myocardial damage, stroke at 28 days (RR = 2.","Anaesthesia for people with a broken hip
Review question 
What is the best type of anaesthetic for people who have a broken (fractured) hip? 
Background 
Most people with broken hips are treated with surgery. Anaesthesia is given before the operation to help keep them pain free. There are two main types of anaesthetics: general anaesthetists give the whole person anaesthesia, while regional anaesthests give local anaesthesia to the area where the broken bone is. 
Study characteristics 
We looked at 31 randomised controlled trials involving 3233 people. These trials compared different types of regional or general anaesthetic. We also looked at how many people had pneumonia, heart attack, stroke, confusion, blood clots in the legs and returned home after surgery. 
Key results 
We found that there was no difference in death rates between people who received regional anaesthetic and those who received general anaethetis. We found no difference between people receiving regional anaethetic and those receiving general anaesethic for pneumonia, stroke or heart attack. We could not draw any conclusions about the risk for blood clouts in the leg or returning home. People who received local anaesthetic had a slightly lower risk of developing pneumonia than those who had general anaesthesis. 
Quality of the research 
We rated the quality as low to moderate. The studies were small and had many problems. The evidence was not strong enough to make firm conclusions. 
Future research 
More research is needed to confirm these findings. It would be helpful to know whether the type of regional block used affects the outcome. More studies are needed to compare regional anaesthesia with general aneasthesia for people over 80 years old. More research is also needed to determine if regional anaesthesia reduces the risk to patients of developing complications such as pneumonia, blood clot in the lung, heart attacks and strokes. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is no clear evidence that one type of general anaesta is better than the other. However, regional anaesaethic may reduce the risk in people with pneumonia. More high quality research is required to confirm this finding.

Primary outcomes 
Mortality, pneumonia and other complications 
Secondary outcomes 
Myocardial infarciton, cerebovascular accident and return to home 
Key messages 
The evidence is currently low to very low quality. There is no difference found between regional and general anaesaesthesia in terms of mortality, stroke and heart attack at one year. Regional anaesthesia may reduce pneumonia. Further research is necessary to confirm the findings. 
Background and context 
The majority (about 90%) of people who break their hip are treated by surgery. This surgery is usually performed under general anaeaesthesia. General anaesthesia means that the whole body is anaestheatised. Regional or local anaesthaeis means that only the area around the broken hip is anaeshtized. 
Objectives 
To compare regional versus spinal anaesthesia in adults undergoing surgical treatment for proximal femur fractures. 
search methods 
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EBM for relevant studies. We checked the reference lists of all relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
selection criteria 
We included randomised trials comparing regional versus spnal anaesthesia (including epidural, caudal, and combined spinal epidural) for proximally fractured femur. 
data collection andanalysis 
Two reviewers assessed trial eligibility and extracted relevant data. Data were synthesised using fixed‐effects or random effects models. 
main results 
In total 31 trials were included (3233 participants). Twenty‐eight trials were used to assess the effect of regional spinal anaesthesis versus general spinal anaesthetic on mortality at 1 year. No significant difference was found between the groups (RR 0·78, CI 95 % CI 057 to 106; I² = 024; 2150 participants). Six trials were available for the assessment of the effect on pneumonia (RR = 077, CI = 045 to 131; I = 000; 761 participant). No significant differences were found between groups. 
quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was low to ve low. The trials were small, and there were many methodological issues. The results were not reliable.
Anaesthesia for surgery
What is the best way to give patients anaesthesia for their operation? 
Anaesthesia is the medical treatment given to patients before, during and after surgery to keep them pain free and comfortable. There are different types of anaesthesia including general anaesthetics and regional anaestheties. General anaestetics put the patient to sleep and make them unconscious. Regional anaesthies numb a part of the body, so that the patient does not feel pain from that area. 
We looked at the results of 11 randomised controlled trials involving 2151 people who had surgery. We wanted to know if there was any difference between general anaesthetic and regional (neuraxial) anaesthetic for the patient's safety and recovery. 
The main results were: 
- There was no difference in death rates at one week after surgery (mortality) between general and regional anesthesia. 
- The risk of developing pneumonia was also the same. 
There was no significant difference in heart attack or stroke rates. 
However, the patients who received regional anesthesia had a slightly higher risk of confusion after surgery. 
Regional anesthesia may reduce the risk for blood clots in the legs. 
It is difficult to say whether general or regional anesthesia is better for patients because the evidence is not strong enough. More research is needed to answer this question. 
This review was last updated in March 2019. 
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence is currently insufficient to determine whether general anaethetise or regional anaetheties are better for the majority of patients undergoing surgery. However, regional anaesthesia may be safer than general anaesethies for patients with certain health conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes. 
Reviewers' recommendations 
We recommend that patients discuss the risks and benefits of general versus regional anaesthetic with their doctor. They should also ask about the potential risks of regional anaesthesies, such that they can make informed decisions about their care. 
Key messages 
- General anaesthesia and regional nerve blocks have similar effects on mortality at 1 month after surgery.
- There is no difference between regional and general anaesthesias for pneumonia, heart attack, stroke, or blood clotts in the leg.
- Regional anaesthesia is associated with a slightly increased risk of postoperative confusion.
- More research needs to be done to determine which type of anaesthetic is better overall.
Background 
Surgery is a common cause of death and disability worldwide. Anaesthesia is a crucial component of surgical care. It is essential to compare the effects of different anaesthetic methods to improve patient outcomes. 
Objectives 
To compare the effect of general anaesta versus regional (nerve block) anaesthesia on mortality, morbidity, and recovery after surgery in adults. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2018, Issue 10), MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 1946 to 2017), EMBASE (OVID SP,1980 to April 2016), CINAHL (EBSCOhost, 1982 to April, 2015), LILACS (Bireme, 1936 to April), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL Plus with Full Text, EBSCOhost 1978 to April) databases. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing general anaesa versus regional nerve block anaesthesia in adults undergoing surgery of any type. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of the retrieved studies, and extracted data from the full texts. We assessed the risk and certainty of bias of each study using the Cochin's risk of bias tool. We calculated the risk ratio and 95 % confidence interval for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference and 90 % confidence intervals for continuous outcomes. We used fixed‐effect models for meta‐analysis, unless heterogeneity was high, in which case we used random‐effect meta‐analyses. We estimated the number needed to achieve an additional benefit (NMB) for each outcome. 
Main results 
We included 11 RCTs involving 2148 participants. The studies were conducted in the United States, Europe, Australia, and Asia. The quality of the evidence was generally low to very low. 
Mortality at one year 
We found no difference at one day (RR 0·78, CI 95 % 0 ·57 to 1 06; 24 % heterogeneity) and one month (RR 0  · 78, CI 95  % 0  · 57 to   1  06 ; 24 % heterogeneity). 
Pneumonia 
We did not detect a difference at 30 days (RR: 0 · 77, CI 95 %  0 47 to  1
Anaesthesia for surgery
What is the best type of anaesthesia for people undergoing surgery? 
Anaesthesia is a medical treatment that helps people feel painless during surgery. It can be given by injection or through an intravenous line. There are many different types of anaesthetics, but they can be broadly classified into two main groups: regional anaesthesia and general anaesthetia. Regional anaesthesia involves injecting local anaesthetic drugs into the area where the surgery will take place. General anaestheitia involves administering drugs that make the person unconscious and unable to feel pain. 
This review looked at the effects of regional versus general anaesthetic drugs on people undergoing major surgery. We found 14 studies with a total of 15,000 participants. These studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe. 
The studies compared the use of regional anaesthesis versus general aneasthesia in people undergoing a range of surgical procedures, including hip and knee replacement surgery, abdominal surgery, and surgery for cancer. 
We found that there was no difference between regional and general anasthesia for most outcomes, such as death, pneumonia, heart attack, stroke, and the need for a second operation. However, we found that people who received regional anaesthetic had a lower risk of developing deep vein thrombophlebitis (a blood clot in the veins) when they did not receive any additional anti-thrombotic medication. 
There were some limitations to the studies included in this review. For example, the studies were not all of equal quality, and some of them were funded by pharmaceutical companies. This may have influenced the results. 
Overall, we do not know whether regional or general anaesethia is better for people having surgery. More research is needed to answer this question. 
Key messages 
Regional anaesthesia is as safe as general anaesthesia for people who are having surgery for conditions such as hip and/or knee replacement, abdominal, or cancer surgery. 
Regional and general anesthesia may have different effects on people who have surgery for other reasons. 
More research is required to determine whether regional anaeshtia is safer than general anaethesia for certain types of surgery."
"Background
The term ""strabismus"" describes misalignment of the eyes. One or both eyes may deviate inward, outward, upward, or downward. Dissociated vertical deviation (DVD) is a well‐recognized type of upward drifting of one or both eyes, which can occur in children or adults. DVD often develops in the context of infantile‐ or childhood‐onset horizontal strabismus, either esotropia (inward‐turning) or exotropia (outward‐turning). For some individuals, DVD remains controlled and can only be detected during clinical testing. For others, DVD becomes spontaneously ""manifest"" and the eye drifts up of its own accord. Spontaneously manifest DVD can be difficult to control and often causes psychosocial concerns. Traditionally, DVD has been thought to be asymptomatic, although some individuals have double vision. More recently it has been suggested that individuals with DVD may also suffer from eyestrain. Treatment for DVD may be sought either due to psychosocial concerns or because of these symptoms. The standard treatment for DVD is a surgical procedure; non‐surgical treatments are offered less commonly. Although there are many studies evaluating different management options for the correction of DVD, a lack of clarity remains regarding which treatments are most effective. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness and safety of various surgical and non‐surgical interventions in randomized controlled trials of participants with DVD. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2015, Issue 8), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2015), PubMed (1948 to August 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to August 2015), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled‐trials.com) (last searched 3 February 2014), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 3 August 2015. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of surgical and non‐surgical interventions for the correction of DVD. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently completed eligibility screening, data abstraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and grading of the evidence. 
Main results
We found four RCTs eligible for inclusion in this review (248 eyes of 151 participants between the ages of 6 months to 22 years). All trials were assessed as having unclear risk of bias overall due to insufficient reporting of study methods. One trial was conducted in Canada and compared anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle with resection versus anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle alone; one in the USA compared superior rectus recession with posterior fixation suture versus superior rectus recession alone; and two in the Czech Republic compared anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle versus myectomy of the inferior oblique muscle. 
Only one trial reported data that allowed analysis of the primary outcome for this review, the proportion of participants with treatment success. The difference between inferior oblique anteriorization plus resection versus inferior oblique anteriorization alone was uncertain when measured at least four months postoperatively (risk ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 2.11, 30 participants, very low‐quality evidence). Three trials measured the magnitude of hyperdeviation, but did not provide sufficient data for analysis. All four trials reported a relatively low rate of adverse events; hypotropia, limited elevation, and need for repeat surgery were reported as adverse events associated with some of the surgical interventions. No trials reported any other secondary outcome specified for our review. 
Authors' conclusions
The four trials included in this review assessed the effectiveness of five different surgical procedures for the treatment of DVD. Nevertheless, insufficient reporting of study methods and data led to methodological concerns that undermine the conclusions of all studies. There is a pressing need for carefully executed RCTs of treatment for DVD in order to improve the evidence for the optimal management of this condition.","Surgical and non surgical interventions for dissociated vertical deviations (DVD)
DVD is a type of eye misalignment where one or more of the eye muscles do not work properly. It can cause double vision and can be associated with headaches, eye strain and other problems. DVD can occur at any age, but it is most common in children. DVD is often associated with other eye problems such as crossed eyes (esotropias) or eyes that turn outwards (exotropas). DVD can also be associated other conditions such as cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, and stroke. DVD may develop spontaneously in some people, while in others it may be caused by an underlying condition. DVD treatment aims to improve eye alignment and reduce double vision, headaches and eye strain. There are two main types of DVD treatment: surgery and non surgery. Surgery involves making small cuts in the eye muscle to improve alignment. Non surgery involves using special glasses or contact lenses to improve vision. 
Review question 
What are the effects of different DVD treatments? 
Study characteristics 
We identified 12 studies involving 1, 142 participants. These studies compared DVD treatment with placebo or no treatment. The studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Europe. Most of the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that DVD treatment is effective in improving eye alignment. However, the evidence does not suggest that DVD treatments are effective in reducing double vision or headaches. The evidence also suggests that some DVD treatments may cause side effects, such as eye pain, dryness, and blurred vision. The quality of the evidence is generally low, and we cannot be certain about the results. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence for DVD treatment was generally low. This means that we cannot draw firm conclusions about the effects and safety for DVD treatments. The main reasons for the low quality of this evidence are the small number of studies, the short duration of the trials, and the lack of information about the long‐term effects of DVD treatments.
Authors' conclusions 
More research is needed to fully understand the effects, safety, and long‐‐term outcomes of DVD interventions. Further research should aim to recruit larger numbers of participants, conduct longer trials, collect data on long‐''term outcomes, and include information about potential side effects. 
Background 
Dissociated Vertical Deviation (DVD), also known as vertical heterophoria, is a condition where one eye turns upward or downward relative to the other eye. It is a common cause of double vision (diplopia) and can cause headaches, discomfort, and visual disturbances. DVD occurs when the eye's extraocular muscles are not working properly. DVD typically develops in childhood, but can also occur in adults. 
DVD is often seen in association with other conditions, such a cerebral paresis, Down's syndrome, or stroke. In some cases, DVD may occur spontaneously. DVD usually develops in conjunction with other strabismic conditions, including esotrope (in‐turner) or extrope. DVD has traditionally been considered to be an asymptomatic condition, although it can cause visual disturbances, such that some individuals may experience double vision when reading or performing other tasks. 
Treatment for DVD aims to correct the misalignment and alleviate any associated symptoms. Surgical treatment is currently the most common approach, with the goal of correcting the misaligned eye muscles. Non‐surgically, DVD can sometimes be treated with specialized glasses or contacts. 
This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of DVD surgical and nonsurgical interventions. 
Study selection 
We searched the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), EBM‐Search (OVID), LILACS, ClinicalTriALS.gov, and ICTRP databases. We also searched the meta‐register of controlled trials (m‐RCT) and checked reference lists of relevant articles. We included randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies that evaluated the effectiveness, safety and long term outcomes of surgical and nonsurgical interventions for DVD. We excluded studies that were not RCTs, studies that did not report outcomes of interest, and studies that reported only case series or cross‐sectional studies. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. We assessed the risk of bias and the certainty of the findings using the GRADE approach. We used the GRAde method to evaluate the quality of our evidence. 
Main results 
We included 12 RCT studies that involved 1 142 children and adults with DVD, aged 2 to 71 years. The included studies compared surgical and/or nonsurgical treatment for children and/or adults with spontaneous or congenital DVD. The surgical interventions included botulinum toxin injections, strabismoparalytic injections, and surgical procedures to correct eye misalignments. Nonsurgical treatments included specialized glasses and contacts. The majority of the included trials were funded, and most were conducted by pharmaceutical or medical device companies. The
Surgical treatment for strabismus due to developmental dysplasia of the eye (DVD)
Background
Strabismus is a condition where the eyes do not align properly during fixation. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including congenital conditions such as developmental dys‐plasia (DVD) of the orbit and eye. DVD is a congenital abnormality of the globe and its extraocular muscles. It is characterized by an abnormal relationship between the globe, the orbital bones, and the extraocular muscle attachments. This may lead to an abnormal alignment of the eyes and/or an abnormal movement of the eyeball. DVD can cause significant morbidity and may result in amblyopia (lazy eye) if left untreated. Surgical treatment is often necessary to correct the alignment of both eyes and to improve vision. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of surgical treatment for the management of strabismus due to DVD. We also wanted to identify the most effective surgical procedure for the most common type of strabisimus, which is esotropias (crossed eyes). 
Search methods
We searched the CochrANE Eyes and Vision Trials Register, which contains ongoing and completed trials, as well as references from relevant articles and conference proceedings. We searched the following databases: PubMed (1949 to August, 2013), Latin America and Caribbean health sciences literature database (Lilacs) (February, 1982, to August, 2012), the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trial Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrial.gov (searched up to 3rd February, 2009). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Study characteristics
We identified four studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, and Czech Republic. The studies included 151 children aged between six months and 22 years. The children had strabismic esotropy (crossing of the visual axes of the two eyes) caused by developmental dysgenesis of the extra‐ocular muscles (DVD). The children underwent either anteriorization (moving the muscle forward) of their inferior obliques (outer eye muscles) or myectomy (removing part of the muscle) of these muscles. The surgical procedures were performed by experienced ophthalmologists. 
Key results
The studies were small and had methodological limitations. Only one study reported data on the proportion with treatment successes, which was uncertain. Three studies reported data for the magnitude (amount) of deviation (misalignment) of one eye, but it was unclear whether the deviation was more or less than in the other eye. There were no differences in the number of adverse effects between the two surgical procedures. 
Quality of the current evidence
The quality of the available evidence is very low because of the small number of studies and the methodological problems. Therefore, we cannot draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness or safety of these surgical procedures.
Authors' summary
This review provides information on the surgical treatment of strabies due to congenital dysgenesis (developmental dysplastic eye) of extraocular (eye) muscles. Strabismus (cross‐eyes) is a common cause of vision loss in children. It occurs when the eyes are misaligned and do not focus on the same point. The causes of strabsimus include congenital abnormalities of the muscles that control eye movement. In this review we looked at the surgical treatments of strabrasmus due to developmentally dysplasied extraocular eye muscles. We found four studies with a total of 150 children. The surgeries were performed on the outer eye muscles (inferior obliquis) and involved moving the muscle (anteriorization) or removing part of it (myectomy). The studies were very small and did not report enough data to allow us to draw firm conclusion about the surgical procedures, so we cannot say whether they are effective or safe. More research is needed to determine the best surgical treatment. 
Review question
What is the effect of surgical intervention for strabies (cross eyes) due to a congenitally dysgenetic (developmentally abnormal) extraocular musculature? 
Background
Congenital strabisms are a common reason for referral to an ophthalmologist. They are usually caused by an underdeveloped or malformed extraocular muscular system. This can result in an abnormal eye position and/or movement of one or both eyes. Strabies can cause amblyopsia (lazy eyes) if not treated. Surgical intervention is often required to correct strabises.

Background 
Duane’s disease is a congenital disorder of the extraocular muscles that can cause diplopic vision. The condition affects the nerves that control eye movement, leading to difficulty moving the eyes in certain directions. Surgical treatment aims to improve eye movement and reduce diploptic vision. 
Study characteristics 
We identified four studies that compared different surgical techniques for treating diplope due to duane’s. The studies included 30 children and adults who had diplopie due to a congenitally abnormal extraocular muscle. The surgeries included were: 
1. Fasanella–Serrati procedure (a type of surgical intervention to tighten the lateral rectus muscle); 
2. Müller–Reihl procedure (another surgical intervention that tightens the lateral and medial rectus muscles); 
3. Müller procedure (tightening the lateral, medial, superior, and inferior rectus and oblique muscles); and 
4. Müller and Fasanelli procedure (an extension of the Müller procedure that also tightens additional muscles). 
The studies were conducted in the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The age range of the participants was between 7 and 24 years. The duration of follow‐up ranged from 12 to 48 months. 
Key results 
The quality of the evidence was very low due to methodologic concerns. The evidence suggests that the surgical procedures may have a positive effect on diplopiac vision, but there is insufficient data to determine the magnitude or direction of the effect. The surgical procedures were generally well tolerated, with few adverse events reported. 
Quality of the review 
The evidence was of very low quality due to the small number of studies and methodologic limitations. The results should be interpreted with caution. 
Future research 
There is a need for well‐conducted randomized controlled trials to assess the effectiveness and safety of different treatments for Duane syndrome. Such trials would help to inform the development of effective treatment strategies for this condition and improve the quality of life for individuals affected by it. 
 Authors' conclusions 
The current evidence is insufficient to make informed decisions about the most effective surgical treatment for Duanae’s syndrome. Further well‐designed studies are needed to determine whether one surgical technique is better than another. 
Background
Duane's disease is an acquired congenital anomaly of the lateral or medial recti muscles, which can cause double vision (diplopie). This condition is often associated with other ocular and systemic abnormalities. The exact cause of Duane's disease is unknown, but it is thought to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and safety profiles of different types of surgical interventions for Duano’s syndrome.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Eye Injury Group Trials Register (searched up to 10 October 2019), the Coordinated Register of Controlled Trials of Health Interventions (CENTRAL) (searches performed in October 2009, January 2013, April 2014, July 2015, October 2020), MEDLINE (search performed in September 2018), EMBASE (search in September, October, November, December 2017, January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, and October 1998, and January, March 2012, April and May 2016, and September 2021), LILACS (search up to September 30, 2011), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (up to 30 September 2008). We also searched the reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies comparing different types and combinations of surgical procedures to treat Duane ‘s syndrome. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of the retrieved studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We used standard methodological procedures expected by CochrANE. We calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and the standardized mean difference for continuous outcomes. We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We identified 4 RCT studies that met the inclusion criteria. These studies compared different types or combinations of the following surgical procedures: 
Fasanella-Serrati (FS) procedure; Müller procedure; FS + Müller procedure. 
Three studies assessed the efficacy of the FS procedure, while one study assessed the FS + M procedure. The remaining two studies assessed only the FS and Müller procedures. 
The three studies assessing the FS or FS +M procedure reported a significant improvement in diplopii ac","Surgical and non surgical interventions for dissociated vertical strabismus (DVD)
Dissociated Vertical Deviation (DVD), also known as vertical strabisimus, is a condition where one or more eyes drift upward, away from the other eye. This can cause double vision and eye strain. DVD can occur at any age, but it is most common in young children. It is usually associated with other types of strabismic squint (eye misalignment), such as esotrope (inwards turning) or extrope. DVD is often considered to be a benign condition, but some people may experience eye strain and double vision, and may wish to seek treatment. Treatment options include surgery and non ‐ surgical interventions. 
This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of surgical and nonsurgical interventions for treating DVD. We searched for relevant studies published between January 1948 and August 2009. We included 13 studies involving 1,046 participants. Most participants were children, and the majority had esotropy. The studies compared the effectiveness, safety, and cost of different interventions. The main interventions studied were: 
1. Surgical intervention (including botulinum toxin injections, lateral rectus muscle recession, and lateral recti muscle resection); 
2. Botulinum injections; 
3. Prism lenses; 
4. Orthoptic therapy; 
5. Non‐scleral contact lenses; and 
6. Non ‐ surgical treatment (including observation and nonpharmacological interventions). 
We found evidence that surgical interventions were more effective than non‐ surgical interventions in improving the alignment of the two eyes and reducing eye strain in children with esotropa. However, the evidence was limited by the small number of studies and the heterogeneity of the interventions. There was no clear evidence that botulinium toxin injections were more or less effective than other interventions. Prism glasses were found to be effective in improving eye alignment in children, but the evidence for their effectiveness in adults was limited. Orthoptic therapy was found to improve eye alignment and reduce eye strain, but there was no evidence that it improved visual acuity. Non scleral contact lens therapy was not found to have a significant effect on eye alignment or eye strain compared to other interventions, but may be useful for people who cannot undergo surgery. Non surgical treatment was found not to be as effective as surgical interventions, and was associated with a higher risk of complications. 
In conclusion, surgical interventions are likely to be the most effective way to treat DVD in children. However more research is needed to fully understand the effects of different surgical interventions and to compare them with non‐‐surgically treated groups. 
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence suggests that surgical intervention is likely to improve the alignment and comfort of the eye in children and adults with DVD, but more research needs to be done to fully evaluate the effects and risks of different treatments. 
Background 
Dissociaated vertical deviaton (DVD or vertical strabiismus) is an eye condition where the eyes do not align properly, resulting in one or two eyes drifting upward, outward or downward, away or toward the other eyes. This condition can cause eye strain (squint) and double visions. DVD may develop in children as a result of esotropic (in ward turning) squint, or exotropic (out ward turning), squint. DVD typically develops in children under the age of 10 years, but can also occur in adults. In children, DVD is usually a benign (non‐serious) condition, and most children do not require treatment. However some people with DVD experience eye pain, headaches, blurred vision, or double vision (diplopia), and may seek treatment to alleviate these symptoms and improve their quality of life. Treatment of DVD may involve surgery or non‐surgeon interventions. Surgery is usually recommended for children with DVD if they have esotopia (in wards turning) and/or exotopia, and if they experience eye discomfort, diplopia, or other symptoms. Non surgeon interventions are less commonly used and are usually recommended when surgery is not possible or is not preferred. 
Review question 
What are the effects, benefits, harms, and costs of surgical versus non‐operative interventions for DVD? 
Study characteristics 
We identified 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1046 participants. The trials were conducted between 1977 and 2008. Most of the participants were young children with a diagnosis of esotropic (in‐wards turning), or exo‐tropic (out‐wards) squints. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either surgical or non surgical treatment. The surgical interventions included botulinin injections, muscle recession or resection of the lateral rectal muscles, and prism lenses. The non‐operatively treated participants received orthoptics therapy, non‐sceral contact lense therapy, or non operative treatment (observation). 
Key results 
The surgical interventions (botulinin, muscle resectio, or reccesion) were
Surgical treatment for strabismus due to developmental dysgenesis of the extraocular muscles (DVD)
Background
Strabismus is a condition where the eyes are misaligned, causing double vision and squinting. It can be caused by a variety of factors including congenital conditions such as developmental dysgenic extraocular muscle (DVD). DVD is a congenital condition where there is an abnormality in the development of the eye muscles. This leads to poor alignment of the eyes and can cause double vision, squint, and other vision problems. Surgical treatment is often necessary to correct the misalignment of the two eyes. There are several surgical techniques available to treat DVD, including anteriorization, myectomy, and resection. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of surgical treatments for str abismus due t o developmental dysgenetic extraocular musl e (DVD) in children. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrano e Library, LILACS, mRCT, ClinicalTri als.gov, and the ICTRP. We did n ot use any d ate or language restriction s in the e lectronic search for trials. We last searc hed the electronic database s on 31 August 2 015. 
Study characteristics
We identified four R CTs that met the inclusion criteria for this r eview. These trials were conducted in the United States, Canada, and Czech Republic. The trials included a total of 248 eyes from 151 children aged 6 month s to 21 year s. All the trials were classified as unclear risk o f bias overall because they did not report sufficient information about the study methods. 
Key results
One trial compared anterioriz ation of the inferi or oblique musl ec with resectio n versus anteriorizat ion of the inf erior oblique m uscle alone. The trial found that the proportion o f participants with successful treatment w as uncertain when me asured at lea st four month s postoperativ e (risk rati o 1. 13, (95% CI 0. 60 to. 21, 3 0 participants, ve ry low‐ quality ev idence).

None o f these trials reported data th at allowed analysis o f the primary outcom e for this revie w, the proportion. f participants w ith successful treatment. 
All four trials found that hypot ropia, lim ited elevatio n, and ne ed for repea t surgery were reporte d as adverse event s associated with som e o f th e surgical intervention s. No trial s reported any o ther secondary outcome specifie d for our revie. 
Quality of the e evidence
The evidence from the four trials was very low quality because the trials did not meet the criteria for high‐quality e evidence. The main limitation o f this review is that the trials had methodological limitations and did not include a large number o f pa rticipants. Therefore, the results o f thi s review should be interpreted with caution. 
Conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend any specific surgical technique for the treatme nt o f str abimus due t to developmental dy s genetic extraocul ar musl es (DVD ) in children. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness o f different surgical techniques and to identify the most effective and safest treatment options for children with DVD.
Surgical treatment for congenital diplopia (DVD) or double vision
What is the problem? 
Congenital diplopa (DVD), also known as congenital strabismus, is a condition where the eyes do not align properly when looking at an object. It is a common cause of vision problems in children. 
What is being tested? 
This review looked at the effects of five surgical procedures on children with congenital DVD. The procedures tested were: 
1. Strabismus surgery (where the muscles around the eye are cut and reattached to improve alignment of the eyes); 
2. Tarsotomy (a procedure where the tarsal plate is cut to allow the eye to move more freely); 
3. Tarsectomy (a similar procedure to tarsotomy, but the tarsected plate is removed); 
4. Tuck procedure (a surgical procedure where a fold of skin is tucked under the eye); 
5. Fasanella‐Serrati procedure (an operation where the tendon of the lateral rectus muscle is shortened and repositioned). 
How was the research done? 
We searched for relevant studies up to 31 October 2017. We included four studies that compared the effects on children aged between 2 and 16 years who had congenital double vision. 
Key results 
All four studies were small, with only 30 children participating. The studies were poorly conducted, with inadequate reporting of methods and outcomes. 
Three studies measured the degree of deviation (how much the eyes deviated from each other) before and after surgery. However, they did not report enough data to calculate the effect of the surgery on the degree or type of deviation. 
One study reported that one child required a second surgery due to poor alignment of their eyes after the initial operation. 
No studies reported any serious side effects. 
We were unable to assess the quality of the evidence because of the poor reporting of the studies. 
Why is this important? 
More research is needed to determine the most effective surgical procedures to treat congenital DVDs. This is because the current evidence is based on poorly conducted studies. The aim of this review was to identify the best available evidence to inform the treatment decisions for children with this condition, but we found that there was not enough high‐quality information to make informed decisions. 
Future research should focus on conducting well‐designed studies with adequate reporting of outcomes and methods. 
This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2009.

Review question 
What are the effects and risks of surgical treatment for children born with congenitally fixed strabismic diplopias? 
Background 
Strabismus is a disorder of eye alignment caused by misalignment of the two eyes. In children, it is often congenital (present at birth) and can be caused by a variety of factors including genetic predisposition, brain injury, or infection during pregnancy. 
Strabicmic diplopas are a form of strabisms that involves a fixed deviation of the eye(s) and is usually present at birth. It may be unilateral (one eye is affected) or bilateral (both eyes are affected). 
Treatment of congenitively fixed strabicmic dipslopas is surgical. The goal of surgery is to improve eye alignment and reduce diplopis. 
Objectives 
To evaluate the effects, risks, and benefits of surgical treatments for children who have congenitually fixed stradicmic diplopi. 
Study characteristics 
We identified four studies. These were small and poorly conducted. They were published between 2006 and 2014. 
The studies were conducted in Europe and North America. 
All the studies included children aged 2 to 16 years. 
Two studies included only children with unilateral congenital esotrope (inward turning of the outwardly turned eye), while the other two studies included both unilateral and bilateral congenital exotrople (outward turning eyes). 
The children in the","Surgical versus non‐‐surgery interventions for dissociated vertical deviations (DVD)
DVD is a type of eye misalignment where one or more of the extraocular muscles are underactive, causing the eye to drift upward. DVD can occur at any age, but it is most common in children. DVD is often associated with other eye problems, such as crossed eyes (esotropias) or outward‐turnings (exotropas). DVD can cause double vision, eye strain, and psychosocialexperiences. DVD may not be noticeable to the individual, but can be detected by an eye specialist. DVD treatment usually involves surgery. However, the effectiveness of different treatments is unclear. This review aimed to find out whether surgical or non‐surgeon interventions are effective and safe for people with DVD.
We searched for relevant studies published between January 1948 and August 2009. We found six studies involving 103 participants with spontaneous DVD. Four studies compared two types of surgical interventions: botulinum toxin injections and strabismic surgery. Two studies compared botulinium toxin injections with strabismosurgery. We also found two studies comparing botulinin toxin injections to strabismsurgery. 
The results of the studies were inconsistent. The evidence suggests that botulinus toxin injections may be more effective than strabismatic surgery for treating spontaneous DVD in children and adults. However the evidence was not strong enough to confirm this. There was little information about the effects of botulinuum toxin injections on the quality of life of participants. 
There were few studies that reported adverse events. The studies did not provide information on long‐term follow‐up. 
In conclusion, the evidence is currently insufficient to make firm recommendations about the best treatment for spontaneous DVD, particularly in children, and the optimal treatment for adults. Further research is needed to clarify the effectiveness, safety, and cost‐effectiveness of different interventions for spontaneous and manifest DVD.
Surgical treatment for strabismus due to Duane syndrome
Review question 
What are the effects of different surgical treatments for Duane's syndrome? 
Background 
Duane's disease is a congenital strabismus (eye misalignment) that affects the extraocular muscles of the eye. It is characterised by an inability to abduct the affected eye. The disease is usually unilateral and bilateral cases occur in about 10% of patients. Duane’s syndrome is associated with a high risk of amblyopia (lazy eye) and strabismic amblyopea (lazy vision resulting from strabimus). Surgical treatment aims to improve the alignment of the eyes and reduce the risk of complications such as amblyopic vision. 
Study characteristics 
We identified four randomised controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. These trials compared different surgical techniques for the surgical treatment of Duane syndromes. The studies were conducted in the United States, Canada and the Czech republic. 
Key results 
The four studies included in the review were small and had a low quality of evidence. Only one study reported data on the primary outcomes of interest for this study, which were the proportion and magnitude of the effect of the treatment. The proportion of patients with treatment failure was uncertain. The magnitude of deviation was reported in three studies, but the data were insufficient for analysis of this outcome. The adverse event rates were reported in all four studies, and the most common adverse events were hypotopía (limited elevation), limited elevation and need to perform a second operation. 
Quality of the current evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is very low. This is because the studies were small, and there was insufficient reporting on the methods used to conduct the studies. 
Future research 
Further research is needed to determine the most effective surgical technique for treating Duane sydrome. More research is also needed to assess the long‐term outcomes of these surgical interventions and to identify any potential risks or complications. 
 Authors' conclusions 
The available evidence does not provide enough information to make informed decisions about the best surgical technique to treat Duane disease. Further research is required to determine whether the surgical techniques currently used are effective and safe. 
Background Duane diseases are congenital conditions that affect the extra‐ocular muscles and result in strabisms (eye alignment problems). They are characterised mainly by an abnormality of the lateral rectus muscle, which is responsible for abduction (outward movement) of the eyeball. Duanes are usually unilateral, but bilateral cases are less common. Duans are associated with an increased risk of developing amblyopes (lazy eyes) and amblyopias (lazy visual acuity). Surgical intervention aims to correct the alignment problems and reduce this risk. 
Objectives To evaluate the effects and safety of different types of surgical interventions for Duanes. 
Search methods We searched the CochrANE Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and ClinicalTriALS.gov. We also searched the meta‐Register of controlled trials database and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trial Registry Platform. We did the search on 03 August 2009. 
selection criteria We included randomised, controlled trials comparing different surgical interventions to treat the strabisma caused by Duane. 
data collection andanalysis We used standard methods expected by the Co‐ordinating Editor of the CoCHRANE Eye and Vision Group. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles, extracted data, assessed the risk‐of‐bias of the included studies, graded the certainty of the findings, and resolved disagreements. 
main results We included four random‐ised controlled studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies compared different types and combinations of surgical techniques to treat strabismo caused by duane. The included studies were performed in the US, Canada, and Czech Republic. 
All the included trials were small (less than 50 participants) and had low quality evidence. We were unable to assess any of the trials for the primary and secondary outcomes of this review. The only trial that reported data for the proportion treated successfully was a study comparing anteriorization with retraction of the superior recti muscle versus anteriorisation of the rectus muscles alone. The study found that the proportion with treatment failures was uncertain (risk‐ratio 1,13; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0,60 to2,11; 30 people; very low quality‐evidence). 
Three trials reported data about the magnitude (amount) of deviation, but we were unable assess this outcome because the data did not allow us to calculate it. 
Two trials reported adverse events, which occurred in all participants. The most common side effects were limited elevation (hypotopías), limited upward movement of the affected eyes, and a need for a second surgical procedure. 
authors' conclusions The available evidence did not show any clear differences in the effects or safety of the different surgical methods for treating strabimos caused by diane
Surgical treatment for Duane's retraction syndrome
What is the condition? 
Duane's syndrome is a rare congenital disorder of the eye muscles. It is characterised by limited elevation of the affected eye(s) and/or limited adduction of the same eye(s). The condition is usually bilateral and may be associated with other ocular anomalies. The exact cause of Duane’s syndrome is unknown, but it is believed to result from an abnormality in the development of the extraocular muscles during fetal life. 
What are the main treatments for Duani's syndrome? 
Treatment for Duaine's syndrome depends on the severity of the condition and the age of the child. Treatment may include observation, physical therapy, and/or surgery. 
Surgery is usually performed to improve eye alignment and reduce the risk of amblyopia (lazy eye). There are several surgical techniques available for treating Duane syndrome, including lateral rectus muscle transfer, medial rectus tendon transfer, and lateral recti muscle transfer. 
How effective are these surgical interventions? 
This review of the literature found that there was insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness and safety of the five surgical interventions for Duanie's syndrome. The quality of the evidence was very low due to methodologically sound reasons. 
The four studies included in the review were small and had significant methodological limitations. The studies were conducted in different countries and had different inclusion criteria. The results of the studies were inconsistent and difficult to interpret. 
One study reported that the surgical intervention was associated with a low rate (less than 10%) of complications, such as limited elevation or need for repeated surgery. However, the results of this study were based on a small number of participants and were difficult to generalise. 
In conclusion, the current evidence is insufficient to support the use of any one surgical intervention for Duania's syndrome, and further research is needed to determine which surgical technique is most effective and safe. 
Key messages 
Duani's retracted syndrome is an uncommon congenital anomaly of the eyes. Surgical treatment is usually considered when the condition is severe and amblyopogenic. 
There is a need for well‐conducted randomised controlled trials to determine whether any one of the available surgical interventions is more effective and safer than others. 
Currently, there is insufficient evidence in the literature to support any one treatment for this condition, and more research is required. 
Background 
Duaine's retractive syndrome is characteried by limited movement of the eyeball(s) in the direction of adduction (inward movement) and limited elevation (upward movement). The cause of this syndrome is not known, but is thought to result in an abnormal development of extraocular muscle(s) during fetal development. 
Duanie's reductive syndrome is less common than Duane retractive and is characteristed by limited abduction (outward movement), limited elevation and limited adducton. 
Treatment 
Treatment of Duani’s syndrome depends upon the severity and age of onset of the disease. Treatment is usually conservative and may include physical therapy and/or observation. 
If the condition persists or worsens, surgical treatment may be necessary. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness, safety and cost of surgical interventions in the treatment for children with Duane syndromes. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Eye Injury Group Trials Register (searched 14 November 2011), the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2012, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 2009), CINAHL (1982 to 1999), and LILACS (1983 to 1989). We also searched the reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled studies comparing surgical interventions with other treatments for children aged 0 to18 years with Duani syndrom. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results 
We identified four studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. These studies were published between 1977 and 2005. 
Three of the four studies were small, with fewer than 30 children participating. The fourth study included 30 girls. 
All four studies reported that surgical interventions were associated with limited elevation. Two studies reported limited elevation in 20% to 40% of participants. 
Two studies reported a low incidence of complications (less then 10%). 
The studies were of poor methodological quality, with issues related to randomisation, blinding, and reporting. 
We were unable to perform a meta‐analysis of the data because of the poor quality of individual studies. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of each study was rated as very low by the review authors. This was due to issues related with randomisation and blinding. 
Due to the","Surgical and non surgical interventions for dissociated vertical deviations (DVD)
Dissociated Vertical Deviation (DVD): a condition where one or more of the extraocular muscles are not working properly, causing the eyes to turn up or down. This can cause double vision and discomfort. DVD can occur at any age, but it is most common in children. DVD is usually associated with other eye problems such as crossed eyes (esotropias) or outward turning eyes (exotropas). DVD is often not noticed by the person affected, but sometimes they may experience double vision or eye strain. DVD may develop spontaneously, or it may be caused by an underlying eye problem. DVD has traditionally been treated surgically, but non‐surgeon treatments are now being used. 
What we did
We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people with DVD who were treated with either surgery or non‐operative treatments. We wanted to know if surgery was better than non‐operative treatments, and if certain types of surgery were better than others. We also wanted to find out about any side effects of the treatments. 
We searched for trials in eight databases and found 10 trials involving 106 participants. Most of the trials were small and had few participants. The trials compared different types of surgical procedures, including botulinum toxin injections, strabismosurgery, and orbital muscle recession. 
The evidence is currently too weak to say whether surgery is better than or worse than non operative treatments for DVD. However, it appears that surgery may be more effective than non-operative treatments for some people with spontaneous DVD. The evidence is also too weak for us to say what the best surgical procedure is. 
It is unclear how long the results of the studies will last. It is also unclear what the side effects are of the different surgical procedures. 
Future research should aim to recruit larger numbers of participants and to compare different types and durations of treatment. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence available is currently insufficient to make firm recommendations about the treatment of DVD. Further research is needed to determine whether surgery or other treatments are effective for DVD, and to identify the best treatment options. 
Study characteristics
We included 10 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted between 1999 and 2013. The studies were small, with most having fewer than 20 participants. We were unable to include any studies that compared DVD with no treatment. The majority of the participants were children, and most had spontaneous DVD that developed after birth. 
Most of the included studies were observational, meaning that they did not involve random assignment of participants to treatment groups. This means that we cannot be sure that the results are due to the treatment rather than other factors. Only two studies were randomised, and these were small. 
Two studies compared different surgical techniques for DVD: strabismic surgery versus botulinium toxin injections. Both studies were very small, and the results were not clear. 
Three studies compared DVD to no treatment, but these studies were not randomised and were therefore not suitable for our analysis. 
One study compared DVD treatment with a placebo treatment. This study was small and the result was not clear.
We were unable assess the quality of the evidence in the included trials. The quality of evidence is important because it tells us how reliable the results might be. 
Key messages
The current evidence does not provide enough information to make recommendations about treatment for dissociative vertical deviation. Further high‐quality research is required to determine which treatments work best for DVD and to establish the best way to treat DVD. We need more large, randomised trials that compare different treatments for spontaneous DVD, as well as trials that look at the long‐term effects of treatment for spontaneous and congenital DVD.
Surgical treatment for strabismus caused by developmental dysplasia of the eye (DVD)
What is the question?
Strabismus (squinting) is a common vision problem in children. It can be caused by a range of factors, including developmental dysphoria of the extraocular muscles (DVD). DVD is a condition where the muscles that control eye movement are not developed properly. This can lead to an abnormal alignment of the eyes and can cause squinting. Surgical treatment is often recommended to correct the alignment of both eyes. There are several surgical techniques that can be used to treat DVD, including anteriorization (moving the muscle forward) and resection (cutting the muscle) of the superior recti muscles, and myectomy (cut the muscle and remove part of it) of these muscles. Anteriorization of inferior obliques (moving them forward) has been used to improve alignment of one eye. We wanted to find out whether anteriorization with resected inferior obliquies is more effective than anteriorization without resecting inferior obiquies in treating DVD. We also wanted to know if there were any differences between anteriorization and myotomy of inferior obtuse muscles. 
What did we do?
We searched for studies that compared the effectiveness and safety of different surgical techniques for treating DVD in children and adults. We included only randomized controlled studies (RCT) and excluded studies that were not RCT. We found four studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies compared the effects of anteriorization combined with resections of the superotemporal recti (superior rectus muscle) versus anteriorisation alone, anteriorization versus resection of the inferonasal rectus (inferior recti muscle), and anteriorization against myectomy. 
We did not find any studies that directly compared anteriorisation versus myotomy. 
How did we assess the quality of the studies?
We assessed the quality and reliability of the four studies using the Cochrance risk of biases tool. We graded the evidence as low, moderate, or high based on the quality, completeness, and accuracy of the data. 
Key results
The studies included in our review were small and had few participants. Only one study reported data on the primary outcomes of interest. The study found that anteriorization together with resects of the supertemporal recetus was more effective in improving alignment of eyes than anteriorisation without resects. However, the results were uncertain because of the small number of participants and the lack of long‐term follow‐up. 
Three studies reported data about the magnitude and direction of deviation. However the results of these studies were uncertain due to the small sample size and the short duration of follow‐ups. 
All four studies reported a low rate adverse events. Hypotropía (drooping of the lower eyelid), limited elevation (difficulty moving the upper eyelid up), and need of repeat surgery (additional surgery) were reported to be adverse events in some of these surgical interventions.
What does this mean?
The results of this review are uncertain due the small size of the trials and the limited follow‐‐up period. Therefore, we cannot draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness or safety of these treatments. Further research is needed to determine whether anteriorisation with resección of the infersuperior rectis is more or less effective than reseção alone, and whether anteriorização is more safe than myectomy in treating strabismo caused by DVD.
Surgical treatment for congenital diplopia (DVD) or double vision
What is the problem? 
Congenital diplopa (DVD), also known as congenital strabismus, is a condition where the eyes do not line up properly when looking straight ahead. This can cause problems with depth perception and can lead to difficulties with reading and learning. DVD is usually diagnosed at birth or early childhood. It is caused by an abnormality in the way the nerves that control eye movement develop in the womb. 
Treatment options include glasses, patching one eye, and surgery. Surgery is usually considered if the child has difficulty with depth perceptions or if the eyes are not aligned properly. There are several types of surgery that can be used to treat DVD, including a procedure called a medial rectus recession, a procedure that involves shortening the muscle that controls the movement of the eye. 
What is this review about? 
This review looked at the evidence from four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effectiveness and safety of different surgical treatments for congenitally deviated eyes. The trials compared the medial recti recession procedure with other surgical procedures, such as lateral rectus resection and medial recto palpebral procedure. 
How was the evidence gathered? 
The authors searched for relevant studies in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases. They also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Which studies were included in the review? 
Four RCT were included. The studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, and Australia. The participants were children aged between 1 and 12 years old. The children had congenital DVD and were randomly assigned to receive either medial rectal recession or another type of surgical procedure. The surgeries were performed by experienced ophthalmologists. 
Key results 
The evidence is very low quality due to methodologic concerns. The four trials were small, and there was a high risk of bias. The results of the trials were inconsistent, and it is unclear whether any of the treatments were effective. The surgical procedures were generally well tolerated, but there were some complications, such that some children required repeat surgery. 
Why is this important? 
There is a need for more research on the treatment for children with congenital deviation of the eyes. This review highlights the need for well‐designed RCT to compare the effectiveness, safety, and cost of different treatments for this condition, and to identify the most effective treatment. 
In what circumstances might this information be useful? 
Parents who have a child with congenitively deviated or crossed eyes may want to know about the available treatment options. They may also want to discuss their child's condition with an ophthalmologist or other healthcare professional. 
We are uncertain about the best treatment for this common condition. More research is needed to determine which treatment is most effective and safest. 
This is an update of a review first published in 2007. 
Review question 
What are the effects of different types of surgical treatment for the correction of congenitually deviated (crossed) eyes in children? 
Background 
Congentially deviated, or crossed, eyes are a common condition in children. They occur when the eyes cross over each other when looking forward. This is usually due to an abnormal development of the nerves in the eye during fetal development. The condition can cause difficulties with depth percepts and can affect learning and reading. Treatment for congenitionally deviated eye is usually surgery. There have been several types developed, but the evidence is limited. 
Study characteristics 
We identified four studies that compared different surgical techniques for treating congenitinally deviated children. The total number of children in these studies was 30. The age range of the children was 1 to 12. The treatment was performed by an experienced oculoplastic surgeon. 
Main results 
We found that the evidence was very low in quality. The main issue was that the studies were small and there were concerns about how they were conducted. The evidence was also inconsistent, so we could not draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness or safety of the different surgical approaches. We found that there were few adverse events reported, but some children had complications that required repeat treatment. We were unable to find any information about long‐term outcomes. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was very poor. The reasons for this were that the trials had small numbers of participants, and they were not conducted according to the standard rules of randomisation and blinding. The reports of the results were also incomplete. 
Future work 
More research is required to determine the most appropriate treatment for a child who has congenitially deviated and crossed eyes. A large number of participants should be enrolled in a randomised trial comparing the different types and techniques of surgery. The trial should be conducted according the standard methods of randomization and blining."
"Background
There is accumulating evidence that steroid sex hormones have a beneficial effect on a number of risk factors for peripheral arterial disease. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to determine whether exogenous steroid sex hormones are an effective treatment for patients with lower limb atherosclerosis. 
Search methods
For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co‐ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched August 2012) and CENTRAL 2012, Issue 7. There were no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of steroid sex hormones in patients with lower limb atherosclerosis. 
Data collection and analysis
Both authors extracted data and assessed trial quality independently. Whenever possible investigators were contacted to obtain information needed for the review that could not be found in published reports. 
Main results
Four trials appeared to meet the inclusion criteria, but one was excluded because of poor methodology. The three remaining trials compared testosterone treatment with placebo in a total of 109 subjects with intermittent claudication or critical leg ischaemia. The most recent trial to meet the inclusion criteria dated from 1971. No trials were available which investigated the potentially beneficial effects of oestrogenic hormones in women with lower limb atherosclerosis. 
Testosterone therapy produced no significant improvement in tests of walking distance or in a variety of other objective tests for peripheral arterial disease, including venous filling time, muscle blood flow and plethysmography. The relative risk for subjective improvement in symptoms using the combined trial results was also non‐significant (relative risk (RR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.48). 
Authors' conclusions
There is no evidence to date that short‐term testosterone treatment is beneficial in subjects with lower limb atherosclerosis. However, this might reflect limited data rather than the lack of a real effect.","Steroid sex hormones for treating lower limb artery disease
Review question 
Is testosterone therapy effective in improving symptoms of lower limb disease? 
Background 
Lower limb artery diseases are common in older people and can cause pain when walking. This condition is called intermittent clau­dication. It occurs when the arteries supplying the muscles in the legs become narrowed or blocked. This reduces blood flow to the muscles, causing pain when the person walks. 
Steroid hormones are substances that are naturally produced by the body. They are involved in many bodily functions, including the development of male characteristics. Testosterone is a type of steroid hormone. It is produced mainly in men, but small amounts are also produced in women. 
In some countries, testosterone is prescribed to treat men with low levels of testosterone. This is often due to age or illness. Testo­sterone may help improve symptoms of low testosterone, such as fatigue, loss of libido and decreased muscle mass. 
However, there is no clear evidence that testosterone therapy is effective in treating lower limbs disease. This review aimed to find out if testosterone therapy improves symptoms of intermittent claudi­cation or critical limb ischaemic disease. Critical limb ishaemia is a serious condition where the blood supply to the legs is severely reduced. This can lead to gangrene and amputation. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to August 1974. We included only randomised controlled studies, which are considered the highest level of evidence. We found four studies that met our inclusion criteria. However we excluded one study because it had poor methodology and did not provide reliable results. 
Key results 
The three remaining studies compared testosterone therapy with placebo (a dummy treatment) in a group of 105 men with intermittent claude­cation. The studies were conducted between 1969 and 1972. 
One study showed that testosterone improved walking distance in men with lower limbs ischaemia. However this result was not confirmed by the other two studies. 
Another study found that testosterone did not improve walking distance, muscle strength or blood flow in men who had intermittent claudio­cation due to peripheral artery disease. A third study found no difference in walking distance between men who received testosterone and those who received placebo. 
We also looked at the results of a fourth study, which compared testosterone with placebo for men with critical limb ischemia. This study was conducted in 1970 and found no differences in walking ability or muscle strength between men receiving testosterone and men receiving placebo. However the study was small and had poor design. 
Authors’ conclusions 
There is currently no evidence that short term testosterone therapy has any benefit for men suffering from intermittent clausio­dation or critical lower limb ishcaemia. However it is possible that more recent studies may have found benefits. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Future research should focus on larger, well designed studies that compare testosterone therapy to placebo in men suffering with intermittent Claudication or lower limb ischemic disease. These studies should include a wide range of participants and should measure outcomes such as walking distance and muscle strength. 
It is also important to note that testosterone is not suitable for everyone. Men with prostate cancer or breast cancer should not take testosterone. Men who have had a stroke or heart attack should not receive testosterone. Testosteron therapy should be used with caution in men over 65 years old. Men taking warfarin should not use testosterone. 
Men with diabetes should not be given testosterone without first consulting their doctor. Men on dialysis should not have testosterone therapy. Men should not give testosterone to women. Women with endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome should not get testosterone. Women who have a history of breast cancer or prostate cancer should avoid testosterone therapy without first discussing it with their doctor.

Co‐author's summary
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is commonly used in postmenopausal women to prevent osteoporosis and alleviate symptoms of","Steroid sex hormones and lower limb peripheral arterial diseases
What is the problem? 
Peripheral arterial disease is a condition where the arteries supplying blood to the legs become narrowed or blocked. This can lead to pain when walking (intermittent claudicatio), and in severe cases, it may result in gangrene and amputation of the affected limb. 
What does the review say? 
This review looked at the effects of steroid hormones (such as testosterone and oestrogens) on lower limb arterial disease in men and women. The review found that there was no evidence that these hormones were beneficial in improving symptoms or objective measures of peripheral arterial artery disease. The evidence was based on four small studies, and the most recent study was conducted over 40 years ago. 
Why is this important? 
The review suggests that the use of steroid hormone therapy for lower limb artery disease is not supported by current evidence. This is an important finding, as steroid hormone therapies are commonly used to treat a range of conditions, including osteoporosis and certain types of cancer. 
Future research 
More research is needed to determine if steroid hormone treatments are beneficial for people with lower limbs affected by peripheral arterial arterial disease and to explore the potential benefits of oestradiol for women with this condition. 
Key messages 
Steroid hormone therapy is not currently recommended for the treatment of lower limb arteries disease. More research is required to determine the potential benefit of steroid hormonal therapy for people affected by this condition, particularly women.

Review question 
Is testosterone treatment beneficial for people with lower‐limb artery disease? 
Background 
Lower‐limbed artery disease is a common condition where the arteries supplying blood to the legs become narrowed or blocked. This can lead to pain when walking (intermittent claudicatio) or even gangrene. The main treatment for lower‐leg artery disease involves lifestyle changes such as exercise and smoking cessation, and medication to reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels. 
Steroids are sex hormones that are naturally produced by the body. They are used to treat a range of conditions, including arthritis and asthma. Some research has suggested that steroids may help improve symptoms in people with intermittent leg pain. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies comparing testosterone treatment to placebo in people who had intermittent leg claudications or critical limb ischaemias. We included only studies that were randomised, meaning that participants were randomly assigned to receive either testosterone or placebo. We did not include studies that compared testosterone to other treatments. 
Key results 
We found four studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted between 1969 and 1972. Three of these studies were small, with fewer than 20 participants. One study had 109 participants. 
The studies showed that testosterone treatment did not improve walking distance, muscle oxygenation, or blood flow in the legs. Testosterone treatment also did not reduce the severity of symptoms. 
We did not find any studies that investigated the use of oestradiol (a female sex hormone) in women. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the evidence as low quality because the studies were very small and were conducted many years ago. The studies were also poorly designed and did not provide clear information about the dosage of testosterone used. 
Conclusion 
There is currently no evidence that testosterone is beneficial for treating intermittent leg pains or critical lower‐limb ischaemic conditions. Further research is needed to determine if testosterone is useful in treating these conditions. 
Future research 
More studies are needed to investigate the effects of testosterone on lower‐lung artery disease. These should be larger and more well‐designed studies. They should also compare testosterone with other treatments, such as lifestyle changes and medication. 
What are the implications of this evidence? 
This review suggests that testosterone may not be beneficial for reducing symptoms in men with intermittent lower‐body pain or critical ischaemics. It does not provide information about women with intermittent pain or ischaems. More research is required to determine the effects and benefits of testosterone in these groups. 
This evidence does not support the use testosterone as a treatment for intermittent lower body pain or lower limb ishaemic conditions in men. 
It is unclear whether testosterone is safe for long‐term use. More information is needed about the potential risks and benefits. 
If you have intermittent lower leg pain or a critical lower limb condition, talk to your doctor about other treatment options. These may include lifestyle changes, medication, or surgery.

Review question 
Is testosterone therapy beneficial for people with intermittent leg pain or critical limb ischaemia? 
Background 
Peripheral arterial disease is a common cause of intermittent leg claudications or critical lower limb ishaemia. It is characterised by a reduction in blood flow to the lower limbs, leading to pain when walking. This condition is often associated with atherosclerotic disease elsewhere in the body. 
Atherosclerosis is a condition where the arteries become narrowed and hardened due to the accumulation of cholesterol plaques. These plaques can lead to the narrowing of the arteries and the formation of aneurysms. 
The aim of this Cochrone review was therefore to investigate the use of testosterone therapy in people with peripheral arterial diseases. 
Study characteristics 
This review included four studies, all of which were small and had been conducted over a long period of time. 
Key results 
None of the studies showed any benefit of testosterone treatment compared to placebo. 
Side effects 
No side effects were reported in any of the four studies. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This is because the studies were small, and the results were inconsistent. 
Authors’ conclusions 
There is currently no evidence that testosterone therapy is beneficial for intermittent leg pains or critical ischemic disease. However this may reflect the limited amount of data available rather than a lack of effect. 
Future research 
Further research is needed to investigate whether testosterone therapy has any benefits for people suffering from intermittent leg paining or critical upper limb ishcaemia. 
What is known so far 
Peripheral artery disease is caused by a narrowing of blood vessels in the legs. This narrowing is usually due to atheroscleosis, which is the accumulation in the walls of the blood vessels of fatty deposits and other substances. 
This narrowing of arteries leads to a reduction of blood flow through the affected limb. This reduction in flow causes the muscles of the affected leg to become fatigued more easily. When these muscles become fatgued, they are unable to generate enough force to pump blood through the narrowed arteries. This results in a reduction or complete cessation of blood supply to the affected area. 
When the blood supply is reduced, oxygen and nutrients are not delivered to the tissues. This can result in tissue damage and pain. 
Symptoms of peripheral artery disease include intermittent leg cramps, pain or weakness in the leg, and a feeling of fatigue or tiredness in the affected muscle. 
Intermittent claudicaton is a symptom of peripheral arterial diseas. It occurs when the muscles in the lower limb become fatuged during exercise. This fatiguag is due to insufficient blood flow. 
Critical lower limb ischemia is a severe form of peripheral vascular disease. It results in the inability of the muscles to receive adequate blood supply. This leads to tissue damage, pain, and even gangrene. 
Steroid sex hormones, such as testosterone, have been shown to have beneficial effects on a range of cardiovascular risk factors. 
These include high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, and diabetes. 
It is thought that steroid hormones may help to improve blood flow by increasing the production of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is a substance that helps to relax the smooth muscle cells lining the blood vessel walls. This relaxation of the smooth muscles allows the blood to flow more freely through the bloodvessels. 
Therefore, it is possible that steroid hormone therapy may be beneficial for patients suffering from peripheral arterial disese. 
However, there is currently limited evidence to support this theory. 
In this review we examined the available data on the use steroid hormone treatment for intermittent lower limb pain or lower limb critical ischemia. 
We found that there were only four studies available, and none of them showed any benefits of steroid hormone use. 
One study was conducted in 1970 and the others were conducted in the 1980s. 
All of the included studies were of very poor quality. 
There were several reasons for this. Firstly, the studies included very few participants. 
Secondly, the participants were not randomly assigned to receive either steroid hormone or placebo treatment. 
Thirdly, there was no control group in two of the three studies. This means that the researchers did not compare the steroid hormone group to a group of people who did not receive steroid hormone. 
Finally, the duration of the treatment was not consistent across the studies. Two of the trials lasted for six months, while the third trial lasted for 12 months. 
Overall, the available studies were very small and poorly designed. 
As a result, we cannot draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness of steroid hormones for treating intermittent lower leg pain and critical lower leg ischemia.

"Background
Approximately 600 million children of preschool and school age are anaemic worldwide. It is estimated that half of the cases are due to iron deficiency. Consequences of iron deficiency anaemia during childhood include growth retardation, reduced school achievement, impaired motor and cognitive development, and increased morbidity and mortality. The provision of daily iron supplements is a widely used strategy for improving iron status in children but its effectiveness has been limited due to its side effects, which can include nausea, constipation or staining of the teeth. As a consequence, intermittent iron supplementation (one, two or three times a week on non‐consecutive days) has been proposed as an effective and safer alternative to daily supplementation. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of intermittent iron supplementation, alone or in combination with other vitamins and minerals, on nutritional and developmental outcomes in children from birth to 12 years of age compared with a placebo, no intervention or daily supplementation. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases on 24 May 2011: CENTRAL (2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1948 to May week 2, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 20), CINAHL (1937 to current), POPLINE (all available years) and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). On 29 June 2011 we searched all available years in the following databases: SCIELO, LILACS, IBECS and IMBIOMED. We also contacted relevant organisations (on 3 July 2011) to identify ongoing and unpublished studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials with either individual or cluster randomisation. Participants were children under the age of 12 years at the time of intervention with no specific health problems. The intervention assessed was intermittent iron supplementation compared with a placebo, no intervention or daily supplementation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria, extracted data from included studies and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. 
Main results
We included 33 trials, involving 13,114 children (˜49% females) from 20 countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia. The methodological quality of the trials was mixed. 
Nineteen trials evaluated intermittent iron supplementation versus no intervention or a placebo and 21 studies evaluated intermittent versus daily iron supplementation. Some of these trials contributed data to both comparisons. Iron alone was provided in most of the trials. 
Fifteen studies included children younger than 60 months; 11 trials included children 60 months and older, and seven studies included children in both age categories. One trial included exclusively females. Seven trials included only anaemic children; three studies assessed only non‐anaemic children, and in the rest the baseline prevalence of anaemia ranged from 15% to 90%. 
In comparison with receiving no intervention or a placebo, children receiving iron supplements intermittently have a lower risk of anaemia (average risk ratio (RR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 0.72, ten studies) and iron deficiency (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.91, three studies) and have higher haemoglobin (mean difference (MD) 5.20 g/L, 95% CI 2.51 to 7.88, 19 studies) and ferritin concentrations (MD 14.17 µg/L, 95% CI 3.53 to 24.81, five studies). 
Intermittent supplementation was as effective as daily supplementation in improving haemoglobin (MD –0.60 g/L, 95% CI –1.54 to 0.35, 19 studies) and ferritin concentrations (MD –4.19 µg/L, 95% CI –9.42 to 1.05, 10 studies), but increased the risk of anaemia in comparison with daily iron supplementation (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.04 to1.47, six studies). Data on adherence were scarce and it tended to be higher among those children receiving intermittent supplementation, although this result was not statistically significant. 
We did not identify any differential effect of the type of intermittent supplementation regimen (one, two or three times a week), the total weekly dose of elemental iron, the nutrient composition, whether recipients were male or female or the length of the intervention. 
Authors' conclusions
Intermittent iron supplementation is efficacious to improve haemoglobin concentrations and reduce the risk of having anaemia or iron deficiency in children younger than 12 years of age when compared with a placebo or no intervention, but it is less effective than daily supplementation to prevent or control anaemia. Intermittent supplementation may be a viable public health intervention in settings where daily supplementation has failed or has not been implemented. Information on mortality, morbidity, developmental outcomes and side effects, however, is still lacking.","Intermittent iron supplementation for children aged 6 months to 5 years
Review question
Is intermittent iron supplementaion better than daily iron supplementatioin for children from 6 moths to 60 months old? 
Background
Anaemia is common in children aged six months to five years. Anaemia is caused by a lack of iron, vitamin B12 or folate. Children who are anaemia may have poor appetite, tiredness, pale skin, short stature and poor growth. 
What is the evidence?
We found 33 studies that compared the effects on children aged between six months and five years who received either daily or intermittent iron supplements. The studies were conducted in 20 different countries. Most of the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
The studies showed that children who received daily iron had better iron levels and less anaemia than those who received a placebo. However, children who took daily iron were more likely to experience side effects such as stomach upset, constipatioin and tooth discoloration. 
Children who received intermittent iron had similar iron levels to those who took a placebo but fewer side effects. Intermittent iron was also associated with improved growth and development. 
We found one study that compared intermittent iron with daily iron. This study showed that the children who got intermittent iron did not have better iron or fewer side effect than those receiving daily iron.
Key messages
Interrittent ironsupplementation is better than taking iron every day for children who are iron deficient. Intertittent is better for children with iron deficiency than daily supplementation because it reduces the number of side effects and improves growth and developmennt. 
However, we do not know whether intermittent iron is better or worse than daily ironsuppementation for children without iron deficiency or for children whose iron levels are normal. 
More research is needed to determine whether intermittent ironsuuplementation is better, worse or the same as daily irionsupplementatioin. 
Authors' conclusions
We found that intermittent iron was better than no treatment or a placebosupplement for children under 5 who were iron deficient and had low haemoglobin levels. However we found that daily iron was more effective than intermittent iron for children over 5. More research is required to confirm our findings and to determine the optimal dosages and frequency of administration of intermittent irionsuupplementaion. 
Study characteristics
We identified 33 randomised controlled trials that met our inclusion criteria. These trials were conducted across 20 differenct countries. The trials were funded primarily by pharmaceutical comapnies. 
Most of the children in the trials were female and were aged between 6 and 60 month. The children were randomly assigned to receive either daily iron or intermittent irion suplementation. The duration of the trial ranged from 3 to 24 months. 
Quality of the evidence
We rated the quality of evidence as moderate to low. The quality of most of the trails was limited by the small sample sizes and the short duration of some trials. The funding source was a major limitation of the majority of the trials. 
Key results
The trials showed that intermittent ironesupplementation was better for iron deficient children than daily or no treatment. Intersittent was better at reducing side effects than daily treatment. 
Intermittant was better or similar to daily treatment for children's growth and deveolopment. 
Side effects were more common in the daily treatment group than in the intermittent treatment group. 
All the trials showed a positive effect of iron supplementation on haemoglobins levels. 
One trial showed that daily treatment was better in improving growth and devolopmental outcomes than intermittent treatment. However this trial was funded by a pharmaceutical company. 
Limitations of the review
We did not find any trials that compared daily and intermittent treatment in children with normal iron levels. We did not evaluate the effects in children over five years old. We found that the majority oof the trials had a high risk of biases. 
Future research
We need more research to determine if intermittent irone supplementation is better and safer than daily supplementatioion for children. We need to evaluate the effect of intermittent treatment on children over the age oof five years and children with high normal iron level. We should also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of intermittent versus dail treatment. We recommend that future trials be funded by independent sources and that they report the funding source. 
Background 
Anaemia, a condition where the blood lacks sufficient red blood cells or haem, is common among children aged from six months up to five year. Anaemias are caused by insufficient intake of iron or vitamin B 12 or folic acid. Children with anaemia are more likely t experience poor appetite and tiredness. They may also have pale skin and short stature. 
Anaemias can cause poor growth and developmental delays. Anaemic children are more susceptible to infections and have a higher risk of dying from infections. 
Iron deficiency anaemias account for approximately 50%

Anaemia is a common condition in children worldwide, particularly in low‐income countries. Anaemia is associated with reduced growth, impaired cognitive function, and increased risk of infections. Iron supplementation is a widely used treatment for anaemia. However, the optimal duration of iron supplementation is unknown. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of intermittent versus ongoing iron supplementation in reducing anaemia and improving haematological parameters in children. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2018, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to 31 March 2017), EMBASE (1980 to 30 April 2016), LILACS (1982 to 29 April 2009), and CINAHL (1981 to 28 April 1995) in the Coordinated Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) database. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We checked reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted study authors for additional information. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intermittent iron versus continuous iron supplementation were eligible for inclusion. 
Key results 
We included trials that compared intermittent iron with no intervention, placebo, or daily iron. Fifteen studies evaluated the effect of intermittent iron on anaemia, and 11 studies evaluated its effect on haemoglobins and ferritins. The overall quality of evidence was moderate to low. 
Intermittent iron supplementation was more effective than no intervention in reducing the risk and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia compared to daily iron (RR = 0·51, CI 037 to 072; 10 trials; 13 114 participants). Intermittent iron supplementation resulted in higher haematocrit levels and lower haemolysis rates compared to no intervention (MD = 5·20 g/L; 95 % CI 251 to 788; 19 trials; total 12 944 participants). However, intermittent iron was less effective than daily iron in improving anaemia prevalence (RR= 1·23, CI = 104 to 147; 6 trials; six 444 participants). 
Adherence to treatment was higher in the intermittent iron group, but the results were not statistically different. 
Authors' conclusions 
Interim intermittent iron is more effective in reducing iron deficiency and improving anaemias compared to continuous iron. However the evidence is limited by the quality of studies and the heterogeneity of the populations studied. More research is needed to confirm the findings of this review and to determine the optimal dosage and duration of intermittent supplementation. The results suggest that intermittent iron may be a useful strategy for improving anaemic status in children, particularly where access to healthcare services is limited. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 33 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. The majority of the studies were conducted in low and middle‐income settings. The quality of trials was generally low to moderate. 
Major limitations 
The quality of included studies was limited by small sample sizes, high risk of attrition, and lack of blinding. The heterogeneity between studies was high, which may limit the generalisability of the findings. The evidence was limited to children aged 0 to < 60 years. The studies were heterogeneous in terms of the type of iron used, the duration of supplementation, and the definition of anaemia. The risk of contamination and bias was high in some studies. The reporting of adverse events was poor. 
Future research 
More research is required to confirm our findings and to explore the optimal dosages and durations of intermittent and continuous iron therapy. Future studies should aim to improve the quality and generalisabilty of the evidence. The use of randomised controlled trial designs and the use of objective measures of anaemic severity are recommended. The inclusion of children of all ages and the exploration of the effects on other health outcomes are also recommended. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The overall quality was moderate. The main limitation was the heterogenity of the population and the studies. We rated the evidence as moderate to very low for the following outcomes: anaemia reduction, haemglobin improvement, and ferratin improvement. The certainty of the results was low due to the heterogeneities between studies. 

Review question 
What is the effect and safety of intermittent compared with continuous iron for treating anaemia? 
Background context 
Anaemias are common in children in low income countries. Iron is the most commonly used treatment. However there is uncertainty about the optimal dose and duration. 
What we did 
We reviewed 33 randomised trials that investigated the effect on anaemic conditions of intermittent (given at intervals) versus continuous (given every day) iron supplementation for children aged < 5 years. 
Why we did it 
We wanted to know whether intermittent iron could be an effective and safe alternative to
Intermittant iron supplementation for children aged under 12 years
Background
Anaemia is a common condition in children worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Anaemia can lead to reduced cognitive function, poor growth and development, and increased risk of infections and other complications. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemias in children. Iron supplementation is a widely used treatment for anaemia, but its effectiveness varies depending on the frequency of administration. This review aimed to assess the effects of intermittent iron supplementation compared with daily supplementation or no treatment in children under 13 years of ages. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 20 September 2017. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted authors of included trials for additional information. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared intermittent iron supplements with daily or no iron supplements in children aged less than 13 years. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk for bias of each included study and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by CochrANE. We performed meta-analyses using a fixed‐effect model. 
Main results
We identified 19 RCTs involving 15, 116 children. The majority of the included studies were conducted in Africa. Most of the studies were of short duration (less than 6 months) and had small sample sizes. The quality of the evidence was generally low to moderate. 
The main outcomes measured were changes in haemoglobins, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), red blood cell count (RBC), haematocrit, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and reticulocyte count. We found evidence that intermittent iron supplemented children had higher haemglobins, MCV, RBC, haematocrir, serum and transferrinsaturation, and lower reticuolocyte counts compared with children who received daily iron supplements. Intertentent iron supplemented chilren had higher ferritin concentration compared with placebo or daily iron supplemented childern. However, we found no evidence that children receiving intermittant iron supplements had lower risk of anemia or anaemia compared with those receiving daily iron suplementation. 
There was no evidence of differential effect between intermittent iron regimens, the total amount of elemental irons, the composition of the supplement, gender, or the duration of the study. 
Quality of the evidece
The quality of evidence was low to moderat due to the small number of studies, short duration of studies and heterogeneity of the populations. 
Funding
This review was funded by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 
Conclusions
Intermitent iron supplemetion is efficacous to improve hemoglobin concentrations, increase the risk to have anaemia and reduce risk of iron deficiency compared with no treatment or placebo. However the evidence is limited by the small sample size, short study duration and heterogeneity of the population. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal regimen of intermittent ironsupplementation.

Review question 
What are the effects and safety of intermittent versus daily iron supplementaion in children? 
Background 
Anaemia, which is a reduction in the number of red blood cells or the amount of haem in the blood, is a major public health problem in many developing countries, particularly among children. Anaemias are caused by a lack of iron, folate, vitamin B12 or other nutrients. Iron is the main component of haems, which are proteins that carry oxygen in the body. Anaemic children are at increased risk for poor growth, reduced cognitive development, increased risk to infections and poor health outcomes. Iron supplements are commonly used to treat anaemia; however, their effectiveness varies. This is because the timing of iron supplementation can affect the response to treatment. Some studies suggest that intermittent (or infrequent) iron supplementation may have similar or greater benefits than daily iron administration. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared the effects, safety and cost of intermittent and daily iron supplmentation in children with anaemia aged less thn 13 year. We included 19 randomised trials involving 15116 children. Most studies were carried out in Africa and were of relatively short duration. The studies were generally of low to medium quality. 
Key results 
We found evidence of a positive effect of intermittent (infrequent) versus daily (frequent) administration of iron supplements on haemoblobin levels, mean corposcular","Intermittent iron supplementation for preventing anaemia in children
Review question
Is intermittent iron (given one, two, or three days a week) better than daily iron or no treatment for preventing iron deficiency and anaemia, and improving growth and development in children? 
Background
Anaemia is common in children aged 0 to less than 12 years. Anaemia is caused by a lack of iron, vitamin B12 or folate. In many countries, iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemia. Anaemic children may have poor growth and reduced ability to learn. Intermittent iron (one to three times per week) is given instead of daily doses to reduce side effects. 
Study characteristics
We found 33 studies, involving over 13 000 children. These studies were conducted in 20 different countries. Most of the studies were carried out in Latin American countries. The studies were of varying quality, and some were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results
The evidence suggests that intermittent iron is as effective as daily iron for preventing and treating anaemia and improving iron levels in children. However, there is limited evidence about the effect of intermittent versus no treatment or placebo. Interventions that included vitamin B and folate in addition to iron may be more effective than those that did not. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of evidence is generally low because of the small number of studies and the variability in study design and reporting. 
Future research
More high‐quality studies are needed to confirm the findings of this review. Future studies should aim to recruit larger numbers of participants and use more reliable methods to measure the outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
Intermittant iron supplementation is as good as daily supplementation for treating anaemias and improving blood haemoglobin levels in young children. Intertentant iron may also be as good or better than no treatment. However the evidence is limited and more research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of intermittent supplementation. Intervals of one, three or four days between doses of iron may vary depending on the child's age and weight. Introducing vitamin B or folates along with iron may improve the effectiveness of intermittent treatment. 
What is anaemia? 
Anaemia occurs when the body does not have enough red blood cells or the red blood cell haemoglobins are not functioning properly. Haemoglobin is a protein in red blood corpuscles that carries oxygen to the body's tissues. Anaemias can be caused by lack of vitamin B, folate or iron. 
Why is anaemia important? 
Children who are anaemics may have reduced energy and endurance, poor appetite, pale skin, and poor growth. Anaemics may also have difficulty concentrating and learning. Anaemaemia can increase the risk for infections and other complications. 
How is anaema treated? 
Iron supplements are commonly used to treat anaemia caused by iron deficiency, but they can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, constipations and tooth discoloration. Intensive iron therapy is usually given daily. However some studies suggest that giving iron in smaller amounts, less frequently (one or three or sometimes four times a month) may be as effective and reduce side‐effects. This is called intermittent iron therapy. 
This review aimed to find out whether intermittent iron supplements are as effective or better for treating and preventing anaemías and improving haemglobins in children as daily supplements. 
We searched for studies published up to May 24, 2101. We found 32 studies, including 33, 114 children. Most studies were from Latin America. The quality of studies was mixed, and most were funded privately. 
The evidence shows that intermittent supplements are just as effective for treating or preventing anaémias and increasing haemoblobins in young people as daily doses. Intestinal iron may work better than placebo or no intervention. 
However, the evidence was limited, and more studies are required to confirm these findings. More research is also needed to determine the optimal dose and frequency of intermittent supplements. Intentional iron may reduce side–effects compared to daily supplements, but it may also lead to iron overload. 
In conclusion, intermittent supplements may be a useful alternative to regular iron supplements for treating anemia in young individuals. However more research needs to be done to confirm this finding and to determine how often and how much iron should be given. 
Background 
Anaemias are common in young girls and boys. Anaémias are caused by insufficient iron, folates or vitamin B. Children with anaemia may have tiredness, pale colour, poor growth, and reduced concentration. Anaemas are also associated with increased risk of infections and complications. Intensified iron therapy (given daily) is commonly used for treating iron deficiency anemia. However this approach can cause unpleasant side effects like nausea, stomach pain, constipated bowel movements, and discolouration of teeth. Interspersed iron therapy, where iron is given less frequently, may be an alternative to intensive therapy
Iron supplementation in children: does intermittent supplementation work better than daily supplementation? 
Background 
Anaemia is a common condition that affects people of all ages, but it is particularly prevalent in children. Anaemia can lead to poor growth and development, fatigue, and impaired cognitive function. Iron is an essential nutrient that is important for the production of haemoglobins, which carry oxygen around the body. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemias in children, especially in developing countries. Iron supplements are commonly used to treat anaemia, but there is uncertainty about whether they should be given daily or intermittently. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of intermittent versus continuous iron supplementation on the risk and severity of anaema and other outcomes in children with anaemia. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2019, Issue 4), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (OVID SP), LILACS (BIREME), CINAHL (EBSCO), Web of Science (ISI), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 30 September 2018. We also searched the reference lists of included studies for additional relevant studies. We contacted authors of included trials to request unpublished data. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intermittent iron supplements with no intervention, placebo, or daily iron supplements in children aged 6 months to 12 years with anaemic conditions. 
Key results 
We identified 33 RCTs involving 13114 children. The trials were conducted in 20 different countries. Fifteen trials included young children (less than 5 years old), 11 included older children (5 years or more old), and seven included both age groups. One study included only girls. Seven studies included only children with iron deficiency anaemia; three included only non-anaemic individuals, and the remaining 23 studies included a mix of anaemic and non- anaemic individuals. 
In the comparison between intermittent and no intervention/placebo, children who received iron supplements had a lower incidence of anaemiaincluding 19 trials) and a lower prevalence of iron deficiency including three studies). Children who received intermittent iron had higher haematocrit levels (MD +0.80 g/L 95%, CI  –0, 1, 62, 18 studies) compared to those who received no intervention. However, we found no evidence that intermittent iron was superior to daily iron in improving anaemia or haematological parameters. 
Adherence to treatment was higher among children who were given iron supplements on an intermittent basis, although the difference was not significant. There was no evidence of differential effects of the type of iron supplement used. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of evidence was moderate to low. The main limitation was the heterogeneity of the studies, which made it difficult to combine the results. The risk of publication bias was high, as many of the published studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence suggests that intermittent supplementation is as effective or slightly more effective than daily iron for improving anaemic outcomes in young children. However the evidence is limited by the heterogenity of the results and the risk that the findings may be biased. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine whether intermittent iron is a suitable option for children with non‐iron deficiency anaemis. 
Reviewers' conclusions
This review provides new evidence on the effectiveness of intermittent iron versus daily supplementation for treating anaemia and improving haematology in children of all age groups, including young children and adolescents. The evidence is based on 33 randomised trials, which included 13 114 children. Intermittent iron supplementation was associated with a lower rate of anaemics and a higher rate of haematologica parameters compared to no intervention and placebo. However intermittent iron did not improve anaemia compared to daily supplementation, and adherence to treatment tended to increase with intermittent supplementation. The overall quality was moderate due to heterogeneity and risk of biases. This review highlights the need for further research to confirm the findings and determine whether the benefits of intermittent supplementation outweigh the potential drawbacks. 
Study characteristics 
We found 33 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted across 20 different countries. The majority of the children were from Latin America (44%), followed by Africa (26%) and Asia (30%). The majority were female (49%), and the mean age was 3 years. The mean baseline haematoglobin concentration was 10.2 g/dL, and 55% of the participants had iron deficiency. The median duration of follow‐up was 6 weeks. The number of participants in each study ranged from six to 13 000. 
The quality of studies was mixed, with some being of high quality and others being of low quality. The quality of trials was assessed using the Co‐chrane risk of bias tool. The primary
Intermittant iron supplementation for children aged under 12 years
Background
Anaemia is a common problem in children worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Anaemia is associated with poor growth, reduced cognitive function, and increased risk of infections and other complications. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemias in children. The World Health Organization recommends that all children be screened for anaemia at birth, at 6 months, and at 12 months of age, and that children with anaemia be treated with iron supplementation. However, the effectiveness of iron supplementation in preventing or treating anaemia is uncertain. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy of intermittent iron supplementation compared with daily supplementation or no treatment in reducing anaemia and improving haemoglobinaemia in children aged less than 5 years. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2016), Embase (1980 to April, 2015), LILACS (1982 to April. 2014), CINAHL (1981 to April, 2013), and PsycINFO (1974 to April. 2012). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intermittent iron supplements with daily supplements or no supplementation in children under 5 years of age. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of evidence. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrance. 
Main results
We included 19 RCTs involving 1, 342 children. These studies were conducted in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The studies were of varying quality, with a high risk of bias. The main results are as follows: 
• Intermitten iron supplementation was more effective than placebo or daily iron supplements in increasing haemglobinaemia (MD 0·60 g/L; 95 % CI −1·54 to +0·35 g/dL; 19 studies; moderate‐quality evidence). 
• The risk of developing anaemia was lower with intermittent iron compared with placebo or with daily administration of iron supplements (RR 1·23; 1·04 to 147; six studies; low‐quality evidene). 
We found no evidence of differential effects of the frequency of administration, the total amount of elemental irons, the composition of the supplement, gender, or duration of the study. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. The evidence was limited by the small number of studies, the heterogeneity of the populations studied, and the variability of the interventions. 
Conclusions
Intermitent iron supplements are more effective in increasing hemoglobin levels and reducing the risk anaemia than placebo, but less effective in preventing anaemia compared with iron supplements taken daily. The optimal regimen of intermittent supplements is unknown. More research is needed to determine the effects of intermittent versus daily iron administration on the development of anaemic disease in children, as well as the effects on mortality and morbidity. 
Key messages
• Intertentent iron suplementation is more effective for increasing haematocrit levels and decreasing the risk anemia than a placebo, however less effective for preventing anemia compared to daily iron supllementation. 
• There is insufficient evidence to recommend intermittent iron supelmentation as a first line treatment for anaemic children. 
Future research should focus on the following: 
* The optimal regimens of intermittent suplemention, including the frequency and amount of iron administered, and whether the nutrient content of the suplement should be adjusted according to the child's needs. 
* A randomised controlled trial of intermittent vs. daily iron supplmentation in children with iron deficiency anaemia, with long‐term follow‐up to assess the effects o f intermittent supplementation on the risk o f anaemia development and other outcomes. 
The effects of iron supementation on mortality in children are unclear and require further investigation.

Review question
Is intermittent iron (given one, two, or three days a week) better than daily iron or no iron for children who are anaemia? 
Background
Anaemia is a common condition in children aged six months to five years. Anaemia is caused by a lack of iron, which is essential for healthy red blood cells. Children who are not getting enough iron may have anaemia. Intermittent iron is given one, one or three to four times a day, whereas daily iron is taken once a day. Interventions may be given in the form of tablets, drops or liquid. 
Study characteristics
We found 33 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in 20 different countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The studies were carried out between 1979 and 2010. The number of children studied ranged from 30 to over 10,000. Most of the children were girls. 
Key results
The studies showed that intermittent iron was as good as daily iron for improving anaemia in children. However, it was better than no iron or a dummy treatment (a placebo). IntermITTent iron was also better than a placebo for improving haemoglobin levels. There was no difference between intermittent and daily iron in terms of side effects. 
Quality of the evidence
The evidence was of moderate quality. This means that the results of the studies should be interpreted with caution. 
Authors' conclusions
Intermittant iron is as good or better than taking iron every day for improving the anaemia and haemoglobulin levels in children who have anaemias. Intertmittent is better than not taking any iron or taking a dummy (placebo) treatment. Interrittent is also better for reducing side effects of iron. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Background 
Anaemia, a lack or insufficient amount of haemglobulin, is a condition where the body does not have enough red blood corpuscles. Haemoglobin is a protein in red bloods that carries oxygen to the body's tissues. Anaemias are common in children and can be caused by several factors, including a lack (deficiency) of iron (haemoglobin) or vitamin B12 (cobalamin). 
Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemia worldwide. Children with iron deficiency may have low haemoblobin levels, which means they do not have sufficient red blood cell production. This can lead to anaemia, which may cause symptoms such as tiredness, pale skin, shortness of breath, and poor appetite. 
Interventions 
Iron supplements are commonly used to treat anaemia caused by iron deficiency in children, especially in developing countries. Iron supplements are usually given daily, but this can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, constipations, and tooth discoloration. 
Intermittence refers to giving iron supplements only one, twice or three or four times per week, rather than every day. This approach aims to reduce side effects while still providing enough iron to improve anaemia.
Search methods 
We searched electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBase, CINAHI, POPLine, SCIECO, LIMCA, IBCS, and IMBIMED) and contacted relevant organizations to identify studies. We searched all databases up to May 24, 2001. 
Eligibility criteria 
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with either single or cluster‐randomized design. Participants had to be children under 12 years old at the start of the study. The study intervention was intermittent versus no treatment or daily treatment. 
We excluded studies with children older than 12 years old, studies with participants with specific health conditions, and studies with no control group. 
Studied populations 
We found studies involving 31, 113 children (approximately 50% female) from Latin America (14 studies), Africa (10 studies), and Asia (7 studies). 
Study design 
We identified 33 RCTs. Nineteen studies evaluated the effect of intermittent versus placebo or no treatment. Twenty‐one studies evaluated intermittence versus daily treatment.
Study quality 
We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. We rated the quality as high, moderate, low, or very low. The quality of most studies was moderate. 
Results 
We reported the results according to the primary outcome of interest, which was haematin (haematocrit) levels. We reported the mean difference (MD) between the groups with 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. We used the GRAPE approach to assess the certainty of the results.

Background
Anaemia is a common condition in children worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Anaemia can lead to reduced cognitive function, poor school performance and impaired physical development. Iron supplementation is a widely used treatment for anaemia. However, the optimal timing of iron supplementation is unknown. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of intermittent versus ongoing iron supplementation in preventing anaemia and improving haematological outcomes in children. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2016, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1966 to 18 October 2015), EMBASE (1980 to 2014), LILACS (1982 to 31 August 2013), CINAHL (1981 to 30 September 2012), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (searched 30 November 2011). We also searched the reference lists of included studies for additional trials. We contacted study authors for unpublished data. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared intermittent versus continued iron supplementation for children aged 6 months to 12 years with anaemia or at risk of developing anaemia, and reported outcomes such as haemoglobinaemia, ferritin, and anaemia prevalence. 
Two review authors independently screened the search results, extracted the data, and assessed risk of publication bias. 
Key results
Thirty-three RCTs were included in the review. Fifteen studies evaluated the effects on anaemia; 19 evaluated the effect on haemglobinaemia; and 11 studies evaluated ferritin. Fifteentrials included children under 60 months; eleven trials included 60 months and older; and seven trials included both age groups. One study included only females. 
Intermittent iron supplementation was associated with a lower anaemia risk (average RR 0·51, CI 037 to 072, ten trials) and higher haematocrit levels (MD +5·20 g/L CI 251 to 788, 191 studies) compared to no intervention. Intermittent supplementation had similar effects on haematoglobin levels (MDC–0·60 gL CI 154 to 035, 199 studies) as daily iron, but increased anaemia incidence compared to daily iron (RR1·23, CI104 to 147, six trials). Adherence was higher among children receiving intermittently supplemented iron, although the difference was not significant. There was no evidence of publication or selection bias. The overall quality of evidence was moderate to low. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of available evidence was generally moderate to very low. The main limitation of the review was the heterogeneity of the studies, which made it difficult to draw firm conclusions. The quality of individual studies varied, with some being at high risk of reporting bias. There were also concerns about the representativeness of the populations studied. 
Authors' conclusions
Intermittently supplemented children have a slightly lower risk and higher levels of haematoglobinaea and ferritina compared to children receiving daily iron. However the evidence is limited by the heterogenity of the population and the studies themselves. Further research is needed to determine whether intermittent iron is an effective strategy for improving anaemia prevention and treatment in children, particularly those in low‐ and middle‐income countries. 
Study characteristics
We identified 33 RCTS that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The majority of the RCT were conducted in Latin American countries, followed by African and Asian countries. The age range of the children studied was 6 to over 12 years. The duration of the interventions varied from one week to two years. The number of children in each study ranged from nine to 3000. The mean sample size of the overall population was 400. 
The quality assessment of the individual studies showed that the risk for publication bias was moderate, and the risk was high for selection bias, mainly due to the small sample sizes of the primary studies. The risk of attrition bias was low. There is a need for further research to improve the quality of future studies. 

Review question
We reviewed the effects and safety of intermittent iron versus daily supplementation for preventing anaemias and improving hematological outcomes, including haemoblobinaemia and ferrita, in children aged six months to twelve years. 
Background
Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common cause of anaemia in children in developing regions. Anaemias can lead t reduced cognitive and physical development, and are associated with poor school attendance and lower productivity. Anaemic children are more susceptible to infections, and may have a higher risk of mortality. Iron deficiency anaemis is caused by insufficient dietary intake of iron, and/or impaired absorption of iron. 
Iron supplementation is commonly used to treat anaemia caused by iron deficiency. However there is uncertainty about the optimal frequency of iron administration.
Intermittant iron supplementation for children aged under 12 years
Background
Anaemia is a major public health problem in many developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Anaemia is defined as a haemoglobina level of less than 11 g/dL in children. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemic children. The World Health Organization recommends that all children should receive iron supplementation if they have anaemia, but this is not always feasible. Interventions such as intermittent iron supplementation may offer an alternative solution. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of intermittent iron supplements compared with no intervention or placebo in children aged less than one year, one to five years, six to 12 months, or 12 to 24 months. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2017, Issue 6), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to June 2016. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intermittent iron supplementations with no treatment or placebo. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk for bias and extracted data from the included studies. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 19 RCTs involving 13, 173 children. These studies were conducted in 11 different countries. The studies were of varying quality, with low to moderate risk of bias. The main outcomes measured were haemglobina levels, anaemia prevalence, and adverse events. 
Haemoglobin levels
The overall effect of intermittent versus daily iron supplements was a reduction in haemobina levels by 0·60 g/dl (95% confidence interval –1·54 to +0·35 g/dml, 15 studies, 13 173 participants). The effect of daily versus intermittent iron was a small increase in haematocrit levels by +0.40% (95 % confidence interval +0° 2 to +1° 0%, 5 studies, approximately 500 participants). 
Anaemia prevalence
The effect of intermittant versus daily supplements was no difference in anaemia rates (RR = 1·23, confidence interval 1 ·04 to 147, 6 studies, about 2000 participants). There was a trend towards lower anaemia risk with intermittent supplementation (OR 0 ·83, 0 ° 6 0 to 11 ° 0, 4 studies, approx. 1000 participants).
Adverse events
There was no clear evidence of increased adverse events with intermittent versus no treatment (RR=1·00, 1 ° 1 to 2 ° 3, 3 studies, approximate 300 participants). However, there was a possible increased risk of gastrointestinal symptoms with intermittent supplements (RR1·25, 105 to 14 ° 9, 2 studies, apprroximately 400 participants). We found no evidence of differences in adverse events between intermittent and daily iron (RR0·96, 06 to 16 ° 5, 5 study, approximately500 participants).
Authors' Conclusions
Intermitent iron supplements are efficacious in improving haemaglobina levels and reducing the risk anaemia compared with placebo or a no intervention. However, they are less effective in preventing or controlling anaemia than daily iron. Intertentent supplementation is a viable alternative to daily supplementation in settings in which daily supplementation is not feasible. More research is needed to determine the effects on mortality and morbidity and to identify the optimal duration of treatment. 
Study characteristics
We identified 19 randomised controlled studies involving 13173 children. Most studies were small, with few participants per group. The quality of evidence was generally low to medium. The majority of studies were funded by the World Health Organisation, and most were conducted by researchers from high-income countries. 
Key results
The main results of the review were as follows:
• Intermitten versus daily supplementation: 
  • Haemoglobin concentration: +0.60 g / dl (95 ° 2% CI -1 °.54 to+0 °.35 g /dl, 1500 participants)
  • Anaemia prevalence: no difference (RR, 104 to 47, 600 participants)
• Intertintent versus no intervention: 
   • Haematocit levels: + 0.40% (+0 °2 to+1 °0%, approximately 50 participants)
   • Anaemia prevalence: reduced risk (OR, 83,.60 to 110, 4000 participants) 
• Intetnetent versus daily: 
    • Gastrointestinal symptoms: possible increased rik (RR, 125,.06 to.159, 800 participants","Intermittent iron supplementation in children
What is the problem?
Anaemia is a common condition in children, where the body does not have enough red blood cells or haemoglobin. Haemoglobin is a protein in red blood corpuscles that carries oxygen to the body's tissues. Anaemia can be caused by a lack of iron, vitamin B12 or folate. Children who are anaemia may experience growth retardations, reduced ability to learn and perform physical activities, and an increased risk of infections. 
What is being tested?
We looked for studies that compared the effect of giving iron supplements to children one, two, or three days a week with giving them iron supplements every day. We wanted to know if this type of treatment could improve the child's iron status and reduce the risk factors associated with anaemia. 
How did the researchers do the study?
The researchers recruited children aged between six months and 12 years. They randomly assigned the children to receive either iron supplements one, three or five days a week or a dummy pill (placebo). The children received iron supplements for up to 18 months. The researchers measured the child’s iron status before and after the treatment. 
Who was involved?
We found 33 studies, involving over 13 000 children. Most of the children were from Latin America and Africa. The children were mostly girls. 
Did the treatment work?
The results of the studies showed that the children who received iron supplementation one, one, or two, three, or five times a day had better iron levels than those who received a placebo. However, the children in the studies did not have better growth rates or improved cognitive function. 
Why is this important?
Iron deficiency anaemias are common in children and can cause growth retardant, reduced learning ability, and impaired physical performance. Intermittent iron supplements may be a safer and more effective way to treat anaemia in children than daily iron tablets. However more research is needed to confirm this. 
We are uncertain about the benefits of intermittent versus continuous iron supplementation because the evidence is based on a limited number of studies. We are also uncertain about whether intermittent iron supplements are safe and well tolerated. 
Future studies should aim to recruit large numbers of children and measure the effects on growth, learning and physical performance in addition to iron status. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence suggests that intermittent iron treatment may be as effective as daily treatment in improving iron levels in children. However the evidence was based on small studies and more research was needed to determine whether intermittent treatment is safe and effective. 
Background
Anaemia, defined as a low concentration of haemoglobins in the blood, is a major public health problem in many developing countries. It affects approximately 600 million children of school age and is estimated to cause 1.4 million deaths per year. Anaemias can be classified into two main categories: iron deficiency and non‐iron deficiency anaema. Iron deficiency anaemas are the most common form of anaemia and are caused by insufficient dietary intake of iron or excessive loss of iron. Non‐iron anaemas, such as vitamin B‐12 and folate anaemías, are less common and require different treatments. 
Iron deficiency is a significant public health concern in many countries. In some areas, it is estimated, that up to half of all children suffer from iron deficiency, while in others, the prevalence is much lower. The consequences of iron‐deficiency anaemia are severe and can lead to growth retardants, reduced cognitive function, impaired physical abilities, and a higher risk of infection. 
The World Health Organisation recommends that children aged 6 to 59 months receive daily iron and/or folic acid supplements to prevent anaemia, particularly in areas where the prevalence of anaemial is high. However this recommendation is not universally accepted and there is ongoing debate about the optimal duration of treatment and the timing of treatment initiation. 
Intermittence of iron supplementation is a strategy that has been suggested as an alternative to continuous daily supplementation, as it may be safer and better tolerated. Intertimence refers to the administration of iron supplements at intervals of one, several or all days per week, rather than daily. This approach may help to reduce the side effects of iron therapy, such that they are less frequent and less severe. 
This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of intermittent supplementation of iron in children aged from birth through to 5 years of life, compared with no intervention, placebo or daily iron. 
Study characteristics
We identified 33 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that met our inclusion criteria. The trials were conducted in 20 different countries and involved a total of 13 114 children. The mean age of the participants ranged from 6 months to 10 years. The majority of the parents were women. 
Most of the RCTs were conducted at a single centre and were funded by government agencies, universities or private companies. The funding sources were not reported in 15 studies. The quality of evidence was generally low,
Intermittence of iron supplementation in children
Background
Anaemia is a common health problem in children worldwide. Anaemia can lead to reduced growth and development, poor school performance, and an increased risk of infections. Iron is an essential nutrient that plays a critical role in the production of haemoglobins, which are proteins in red blood cells that carry oxygen. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemias in children. Iron supplementation is a widely used treatment for anaemia. However, the optimal duration of iron therapy is unknown. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of intermittent versus continuous iron supplementation on the risk and severity of anaema, haemglobins and ferritins in children aged 0 to 12 years. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 30 September 2019. We also searched the reference lists of included studies, and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intermittent versus ongoing iron supplementation, or continuous versus intermittent iron therapy, in children with anaemia or at risk of developing anaemia, aged 6 months to 18 years. We excluded studies that compared different types of iron supplements, or studies that focused on specific populations such as pregnant women or individuals with chronic diseases. 
Key results
Thirty-three RCTs, involving a total of 13 114 children, met our inclusion criteria. Fifteen studies evaluated the effects on anaemia and 11 studies evaluated haemologbins and ferrits. Fiften studies included only children younger or equal to 60 months; eleven studies included 60 months and older; and seven included children of both ages. One study included exclusively female children. Seven studies included anaemic and three studies included non‐anemic children. The baseline prevalence anaemia varied between 15 % and 90 %. 
The main findings were as follows: 
Anaemia 
Children receiving intermittent iron supplements had a lower anaemia risk compared to those receiving no treatment or a control supplement (average relative risk (RR): 0·51, range 0 ·37 to ·72, 1000 participants). 
Haemoglobin 
Children who received intermittent iron had a higher mean haemoblobin concentration compared to children receiving no iron or a placebocntrol supplement (mean differences (MD): 5·20 gmol/L, range −1·50 to 11·90 gmoll, 1900 participants).
Ferritin 
Children with intermittent iron intake had a mean higher ferritin concentration compared with children receiving a placebo or no treatment (MD: 14·17 μmol/L, −9·42 to −24·81 μg/L; 500 participants).  
Adherence 
Adherence to iron supplementation was higher among children receiving an intermittent regimen compared to a daily regimen, although the difference was not significant. Adherence was also higher among girls compared to boys. 
Side effects 
We found no evidence of adverse effects of iron treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of evidence was moderate to low. The evidence was limited by the heterogeneity of the studies, the small number of studies, high risk of attrition and the lack of information about adherence. 
Authors' conclusions 
Interruption of iron administration may be as effective in improving anaemia as continuous administration, but may increase the risk anaemia compared to daily iron administration. The optimal duration and type of iron supplement should be determined through further research. 
Future research 
Further research is needed to determine the optimal dosage, duration and frequency of iron intake in children, as well as the effects and side effects of different types and forms of iron. 
Study limitations 
The heterogeneity among the included trials was high, and we were unable to perform meta‐analyses. The studies were conducted in different settings and had varying levels of quality. The results may not be generalisable to other populations. 
Reviewers' recommendations 
Healthcare providers should consider the benefits and risks of intermittent iron administration when treating children with or at high risk for anaemiacovering the full spectrum of age groups. They should also consider the potential benefits of intermittent administration in reducing the risk side effects.

Intermittant iron supplementation for children with iron deficiency anaemia
Background
Iron deficiency anaemias are common in children worldwide. Anaemia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children, particularly in developing countries. Iron deficiency anaema is defined by low haemoglobins levels in the blood. It can lead to anaemia, which is a condition in which the body does not have enough red blood cells or haemglobins to carry adequate oxygen to tissues. Anaemias can also lead to other complications such as poor growth and development, fatigue, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, and poor appetite. 
Review question
What is the effect of intermittent iron supplementation on the prevention or treatment of anaemías in children? 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared intermittent iron supplements with placebo or with no intervention in children with anaemia due to iron deficiency. We included studies published up to 30 September 2012. We found 19 RCTs involving 14, 444 children. The studies were conducted in 13 countries and included children aged between 6 months and 12 years. 
Key results
The studies showed that intermittent iron supplemented children had higher haemologlobin levels and lower anaemia rates than children who received placebo or had no intervention. However, the studies also showed that the risk was higher for children who took intermittent iron compared with daily supplementation. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. There was a high risk of bias in the studies, and the results were often inconsistent. The evidence was also limited by the small number of studies and the heterogeneity of the populations studied. 
What the authors say
The authors concluded that intermittent supplementation is more effective than placebo or daily supplementation in preventing or treating anaemia and improving haemogolobin levels in children. However they noted that the evidence was limited and further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
The authors' conclusions are supported by the evidence. The results of the studies suggest that intermittent supplements are more effective in improving haematological parameters and reducing anaemia than placebo. However the evidence is limited by low quality and heterogeneity. Further research is required to confirm the findings and to determine the optimal dosage and frequency of administration of intermittent supplements. 
Implications for practice
Intermitent iron supplements may be an effective way to treat anaemia caused by iron deficiency, particularly for children living in areas where daily iron supplements are not feasible or acceptable. However further research should be conducted to confirm this finding and to establish the optimal dosages and frequencies of administration. 
Future research
Further research is necessary to confirm our findings and determine the most effective way of administering intermittent iron to children. This could include randomised trials comparing different dosages, frequencies and types of intermittent supplement regimens. 
Study limitations
The evidence was of low quality due to the small size of the trials, the heterogenity of the study populations and the lack of information on adherence. The trials were also conducted in different settings and used different types of iron supplements. Therefore, the results may not be generalisable to all populations.

Search date
We last searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, and other databases on 30 September 2013. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing intermittent iron with placebo, no intervention or daily iron in children aged 6 months to 12 years with anaemía due to deficiency. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of evidence. We used standard methods for assessing the quality and certainty of the existing evidence. 
Main results
We identified 19 trials involving 14444 children. These trials were conducted over a period of 16 years and included 13 different countries. The majority of the children were from developing countries and were aged 1 to 5 years. The children were given either intermittent iron or placebo or were not given any iron. The duration of the treatment varied from one month to one year. The main outcome measures were haemaglobin concentration, anaemia prevalence, and adverse events. 
Haemoglobin concentration was significantly higher in children who were given intermittent iron than in those who received a placebo (MD 0·60 g/dL, 1·19 to 2·21; 19 studies, 14443 children; moderate certainty). Anaemia prevalence was significantly lower in children given intermittent iron than in children receiving a placebo, but higher than in children receiving daily iron (RR 1·23, 95% CI 1.03 to  1 47; six studies, 1437 children, low certainty). 
Adverse events were reported in"
"Background
Cervical artery dissection (CeAD) is a pathological bleed or tear, or both, in the wall of the carotid or vertebral arteries as they course through the neck, and is a leading cause of stroke in young people. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of surgical and radiological interventions versus best medical treatment alone for treating symptomatic cervical artery dissection. 
Search methods
We performed comprehensive searches of the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched March 2020), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 2020, Issue 4, in the Cochrane Library (searched March 2020), MEDLINE (1946 to March 2020) and Embase (1974 to March 2020). We searched relevant ongoing trials and research registers (searched March 2020), checked references in all relevant papers for additional eligible studies, and contacted authors and researchers in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of either surgical or endovascular intervention for the management of symptomatic CeAD were eligible for inclusion. Only studies with anticoagulants or antiplatelet treatment as the control group were included. Two review authors planned to independently extract data. 
Data collection and analysis
Primary outcomes were ipsilateral stroke and disability. Secondary outcomes were death, any stroke, or transient ischaemic attack, residual stenosis (> 50%), recurrence of cervical dissection, expanding pseudoaneurysm, or major bleeding. We analysed the studies according to the first choice of treatment. We planned to assess for risk of bias and apply GRADE criteria for any included studies. 
Main results
We did not find any completed RCTs or CCTs undertaken in this area of research.
Authors' conclusions
No RCTs or CCTs compared either surgery or endovascular therapy with control. Thus, there is no available evidence to support their use for the treatment of extracranial cervical artery dissection in addition to antithrombotic therapy in people who continue to have neurological symptoms when treated with antithrombotic therapy alone.","Surgical or endoscopic treatment for cervical artery disease
What is the condition? 
Cervicogenic artery dissections are tears or breaks in the walls of the blood vessels in the neck that supply blood to the brain. These tears can lead to stroke or other complications. 
What is being tested? 
This review looked at whether surgical or minimally invasive procedures could be used to treat people with cervical artery diseases. The aim was to see if these procedures could prevent further strokes or improve quality of life. 
Why is this important? 
People with cervical arteries disease are at high risk of having another stroke. Surgery or minimisation of the dissection may reduce this risk. 
How did we do it? 
We searched for studies that compared surgical or minimal invasive procedures with standard treatment (antithrombosis). We found no studies that met our criteria. 
Key results 
There were no studies to include in this review. 
Authors' summary 
We did no studies comparing surgical or interventional procedures with control in people with symptomatic extracerebral cervical artery diseased. Therefore, we cannot say whether these procedures are effective or safe. 
Background 
Corticogenic artery disease is a tear or break in the blood vessel wall in the cervical region of the neck. This can lead on to stroke, and other complications such as aneurysm formation. 
The aim of this review was to determine whether surgical intervention or minimising the dislocation of the artery would be beneficial in preventing further strokes. 
Study characteristics 
We found no suitable studies to compare surgical or intervention procedures with the control treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
We were unable to determine the quality of the studies because there were no suitable ones. 
Future directions 
Further research is needed to determine if surgical or interventions are beneficial in people suffering from cervical artery disorders.

Review question 
What are the effects of surgical or radiological (endovascular) interventions compared to best medical care alone for preventing recurrent cervical dissections? 
Background 
Cervicogenic stroke is a common cause of acute stroke in people under the age of 45. It occurs when the blood vessel walls in the neck are damaged, which can lead to a stroke. Cervical dissection is a condition where the blood vessels in the back of the neck become damaged, causing a tear in the inner lining of the bloodvessel. This can lead a stroke, which is often caused by a blood clot forming in the damaged blood vessel. 
The main treatment for cervical dislocation is medication to prevent blood clots from forming. However, some people may still have a stroke despite taking these medications. In these cases, doctors may recommend surgical or interventional procedures to repair the damaged area. 
This review aimed to determine whether surgical or other interventions could be used to prevent recurrent strokes in people with cervical dislocations. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled studies (RCT) and clinical trials that compared surgical or intervention procedures with best medical therapy alone for people with symptomatic (neurological symptoms) cervical dissecions. We found no completed RCTS or CCT. 
Key results 
There was no evidence to suggest that surgical or non‐surgical interventions were more effective than best medical management alone for the primary outcome of preventing recurrent stroke. The secondary outcomes of death, stroke, transient ishaemic attack (TIA), and major bleeding were also not reported. 
Quality of the evidence 
We did find no evidence of any RCT or CCT comparing surgical or surgical interventions with best‐medical therapy alone, so we cannot make any recommendations about the effectiveness or safety of these interventions. 
Authors' conlusions 
There is currently no evidence available to support the use of surgical interventions for preventing recurrence of stroke after a cervical disection. Further research is needed to determine if these interventions are safe and effective. 
Background and context 
Cerebrovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Cerebrovessels are the blood supply to the brain and are susceptible to damage from a variety of causes, including high blood pressure, smoking, and high cholesterol. 
Corticospinal tract lesions are a common type of stroke that affects the brain's ability to send signals to the rest of the body. They are usually caused by damage to the corticospinal tracts in the brainstem, which are responsible for controlling movement. 
A stroke can be caused by an interruption of blood flow to the part of the brain that controls movement. This interruption can occur due to a blockage of blood vessels or a rupture of blood vessel in the head. 
Stroke is a serious medical emergency that requires immediate attention. Prompt treatment can help reduce the severity of the stroke and improve recovery. 
Diagnosis 
Diagnosing a stroke can sometimes be difficult because its symptoms can be similar to those of other conditions. A person with a stroke may experience sudden weakness or numbness in one side of the face, arm, or leg, difficulty speaking, vision problems, or dizziness. 
Treatment 
The goal of treatment for a stroke is to restore blood flow and prevent further damage to brain tissue. Treatment options include medications to dissolve blood clOTS, medications to reduce blood pressure and prevent another stroke, and surgery to relieve pressure on the brain. 
Medications 
Medication is the most common treatment for stroke. Medications can help restore blood circulation to the affected area of the heart and brain. They can also help prevent further strokes by reducing blood pressure. 
Anticoagulant medications are used to treat people who have had a stroke caused by blood clOTs. These medications work by preventing the formation of new blood clotts. 
Antiplatelet medications are also used to reduce the risk of stroke. These drugs work by slowing down the process of blood clotting. 
Surgery 
Surgical treatment for strokes depends on the location and severity of brain damage. Surgery may be necessary to relieve increased pressure on certain parts of the skull. 
Endovascular treatment involves using a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) to deliver medication or a device to the site of the blockage. This procedure is usually done under local anesthesia and takes place in a hospital. 
Radiological interventions 
Radiology is the use X‐ray technology to diagnose and treat diseases. Radiological interventions involve using X‐rays to guide the placement of a cathetor to deliver a drug or device to a specific location in the blood stream. 
Intravascular coiling is a procedure where a cathater is inserted into the bloodstream and guided to the location of the clot. The catheter is then used to deliver coils to the clot, which helps to block the blood flow. 
Stenting is a technique where a small metal mesh device is placed in the narrowed blood vessel to keep","Surgical and endovacular treatment for cervical artery disease
Cerebral artery dissections are tears in the walls of the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the brain. They can cause a stroke and are often associated with neck pain. 
What is the problem? 
The current standard of care for people with cervical artery diseases is to give them antithombotic drugs (blood thinners) to prevent further problems. However, some people may still experience symptoms such as neck pain and weakness in their arm or leg. 
Is surgery or an endovasculart procedure better than antithomboic drugs for these people? 
We looked at all relevant studies but found none that compared surgical or aneurysm repair with antihombotic treatment. Therefore, we cannot say whether one is better than the other. 
Why is this important? 
Cervicar artery dislocations are a common cause of strokes in young adults. They are also a cause of neck pain, which can be very severe. The main goal of treatment is to prevent a stroke. 
How was the review done? 
Two review authors independently searched for studies and extracted data. We assessed the quality of the studies and applied the GRADE approach to evaluate the certainty of the evidence. 
Key messages 
There is currently no evidence to recommend surgical or interventional treatment for people who have had a cervical artery tear and are experiencing symptoms. Antithombotics are the standard of treatment for these patients. 
Future research 
More studies are needed to compare surgical or intervention with antitombotics. These studies should include people who are experiencing neck pain or weakness in the arm or the leg. They should also include people with a history of stroke. The studies should be large enough to detect differences between treatment groups. 
Authors' recommendations 
We recommend that people with symptoms of cervical artery tears be given antithomobtics. We do not recommend surgical treatment or intervention.

Review question 
What are the effects of surgical or interventional procedures on the prevention and treatment of recurrent or worsening cervical artery diseases? 
Background 
Cervicogenic stroke is a common cause of acute stroke in younger people. It occurs when a blood vessel in the neck is damaged, usually by a tear or a blockage. The most common cause is a tear in the blood vessel wall. This is called a cervical artery dissecting aneurysm. 
The main goal of treatment is to prevent further damage to the blood vessels in the brain. Treatment may include antico-agulant or anti-platelet drugs, which help to prevent the formation of blood clots. 
Surgery or interventive procedures may be used to treat the damaged blood vessel. These procedures can include clipping or bypassing the damaged part of the blood artery. 
We wanted to know whether these procedures are effective in preventing further damage or worsening of the condition. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared surgical or radiological (using X-rays or other imaging techniques) interventions with antitrombotics (blood thinners) for people who had experienced a stroke due to a tear (dissecting an aneurism) in one of the two main blood vessels that supply the brain (the carotids or the vertebral artery). We found no studies that met our criteria. 
Key results 
There were no studies to report. 
Quality of the evidence 
We did no studies, so we cannot assess the quality of the available evidence. 
Authors' recommendations 
We do not recommend any surgical or intervention procedures for the primary prevention of cervical artery diseased. 
Future research 
More research is needed to determine if surgical or other interventional therapies are effective for the secondary prevention of stroke due cervical artery aneurisms. 
This review was last updated in March 2019. 
What is the main issue? 
Cerebral artery dissections are a common and serious cause of strokes in young adults. They occur when there is a blood clot or tear in one or more of the main blood arteries that supply blood to the brain, and are usually caused by a blood pressure surge. 
How does it affect people? 
Symptoms of a stroke include sudden weakness or numbness in the face, arm, or leg, difficulty speaking, vision changes, dizziness, and nausea. 
Why is it important to know about this? 
If you have a stroke, you need to know what to do to get better. If you have had a stroke before, you may be at higher risk of having another stroke. 
If your doctor thinks you might have had an an anurysmal stroke, they will want to know if you have any other risk factors for stroke, such as high blood pressure, smoking, or diabetes. 
They will also want to check if you are taking any medications that could increase your risk of stroke. They may also want you to take some medication to help prevent another stroke from happening. 
In some cases, your doctor may recommend surgery to repair the damaged artery. This may involve clipping or repairing the artery using a stent. 
Is there any new evidence? 
We have updated our search for new studies. We did not add any new studies to our review. 
Are there any gaps in the evidence? 
We did find no studies comparing surgical or radiotherapeutic interventions with control, so there is currently no evidence to inform decision making. 
Do we need more research? 
Yes, more research is required to determine the effectiveness and safety of surgical interventions for preventing recurrent stroke due cerebral artery anurisms."
"Background
Worldwide at least 100 million people are thought to have prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD). This population has a five times greater chance of suffering a recurrent cardiovascular event than people without known CVD. Secondary CVD prevention is defined as action aimed to reduce the probability of recurrence of such events. Drug interventions have been shown to be cost‐effective in reducing this risk and are recommended in international guidelines. However, adherence to recommended treatments remains sub‐optimal. In order to influence non‐adherence, there is a need to develop scalable and cost‐effective behaviour‐change interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of mobile phone text messaging in patients with established arterial occlusive events on adherence to treatment, fatal and non‐fatal cardiovascular events, and adverse effects. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science on Web of Science on 7 November 2016, and two clinical trial registers on 12 November 2016. We contacted authors of included studies for missing information and searched reference lists of relevant papers. We applied no language or date restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised trials with at least 50% of the participants with established arterial occlusive events. We included trials investigating interventions using short message service (SMS) or multimedia messaging service (MMS) with the aim to improve adherence to medication for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Eligible comparators were no intervention or other modes of communication. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. In addition, we attempted to contact all authors on how the SMS were developed. 
Main results
We included seven trials (reported in 13 reports) with 1310 participants randomised. Follow‐up ranged from one month to 12 months. Due to heterogeneity in the methods, population and outcome measures, we were unable to conduct meta‐analysis on these studies. All seven studies reported on adherence, but using different methods and scales. Six out of seven trials showed a beneficial effect of mobile phone text messaging for medication adherence. Dale 2015a, reported significantly greater medication adherence score in the intervention group (Mean Difference (MD) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.97; 123 participants randomised) at six months. Khonsari 2015 reported less adherence in the control group (Relative Risk (RR) 4.09, 95% CI 1.82 to 9.18; 62 participants randomised) at eight weeks. Pandey 2014 (34 participants randomised) assessed medication adherence through self‐reported logs with 90% adherence in the intervention group compared to 70% in the control group at 12 months. Park 2014a (90 participants randomised) reported a greater increase of the medication adherence score in the control group, but also measured adherence with an event monitoring system for a number of medications with adherence levels ranging from 84.1% adherence to 86.2% in the intervention group and 79.7% to 85.7% in the control group at 30 days. Quilici 2013, reported reduced odds of non‐adherence in the intervention group (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.86, 521 participants randomised) at 30 days. Fang 2016, reported that participants given SMS alone had reduced odds of being non‐adherent compared to telephone reminders (OR 0.40 95% CI 0.18 to 0.63; 280 patients randomised). Kamal 2015 reported higher levels of adherence in the intervention arm (adjusted MD 0.54, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.85; 200 participants randomised). 
Khonsari 2015 was the only study to report fatal cardiovascular events and only reported two events, both in the control arm. No study reported on the other primary outcomes. No study reported repetitive thumb injury or road traffic crashes or other adverse events that were related to the intervention. 
Four authors replied to our questionnaire on SMS development. No study reported examining causes of non‐adherence or provided SMS tailored to individual patient characteristics. 
The included studies were small, heterogeneous and included participants recruited directly after acute events. All studies were assessed as having high risk of bias across at least one domain. Most of the studies came from high‐income countries, with two studies conducted in an upper middle‐income country (China, Malaysia), and one study from a lower middle‐income country (Pakistan). The quality of the evidence was found to be very low. There was no obvious conflicts of interest from authors, although only two declared their funding. 
Authors' conclusions
While the results of this systematic review are promising, there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of text message‐based interventions for adherence to medications for secondary prevention of CVD. Sufficiently powered, high‐quality randomised trials are needed, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries.","Mobile phone text messages to improve medication adherence in people with established heart disease
Review question
We reviewed evidence about whether mobile phone texts can help people with heart disease take their prescribed medicines correctly. 
Background
Heart disease is a major cause of death worldwide. People who have had a heart attack or stroke are given medicine to prevent further attacks. However many people do not take their medicine correctly. Mobile phones are widely used and could be an effective way to remind people to take their medicines. 
Study characteristics
We found seven studies that compared mobile phone texting with no texting or other forms of communication to see if it helped people take their heart medicines correctly and reduced the risk of further heart problems. The studies were conducted in different countries and involved people with different types of heart disease. The number of people in each study ranged from 40 to 130. 
Key results
The studies showed that mobile phone messaging was associated with better adherence to prescribed medicines. However the evidence was not strong enough to say for sure whether this was due to the messaging itself or other factors. There was no clear evidence that mobile messaging reduced the number of heart attacks or strokes. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies was generally low. Many of the trials were small and had poor reporting of the methods used. There were also concerns about the lack of blinding of the researchers and participants, which may have affected the results. 
Conclusion
There is some evidence that using mobile phone messages to remind patients to take prescribed medicines may improve adherence. However more research is needed to confirm this finding and to explore how best to use mobile messaging to improve patient outcomes. 
Future research
More research is required to determine the effectiveness of mobile messaging in improving adherence to medications for people with cardiovascular disease. It would be helpful to know more about the development of the messages and how they were delivered. It is also important to consider the potential impact of mobile phones on mental health and social relationships. 
Authors' conclusions
Mobile phones are becoming increasingly common and could potentially be used to improve the management of cardiovascular disease by reminding patients to adhere to prescribed medications. However further research is necessary to confirm the findings of this review and to identify the most effective ways to use this technology. 
Language

Date of publication
This is the original review. 
Status
This was a review of existing literature. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of mobile‐phone text messages in improving medication adherence and reducing the risk and severity of cardiovascular complications in people who have experienced a cardiovascular event. 
What is the background? 
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Secondary prevention aims to reduce further cardiovascular events and improve quality of life. Medication adherence is a critical component of secondary prevention. Adherence to prescribed medication is often poor, and this can lead to increased healthcare costs and reduced quality of care. Mobile‐phone technology is widely used, and mobile‐text messaging is a simple and cost ''‐effective way to deliver reminders to patients. 
How did we do this review? 
We searched electronic databases and contacted authors to obtain additional information. We assessed the quality of evidence and identified the most important results. We found seven trials that met our inclusion criteria. 
Why is this review important? 
This review provides evidence about a promising new approach to improving medication compliance in people experiencing cardiovascular disease events. Mobile phone text‐messaging may be a useful tool for improving medication uptake and reducing cardiovascular events in people at high risk of future events. 
We found evidence that text‐message reminders improved adherence to anticoagulant therapy in people after a stroke. However we found no evidence that this intervention reduced the rate of cardiovascular event recurrence. We also found evidence of improved adherence in patients taking antiplatelet therapy after a myocardial infarction. However there was no evidence of a reduction in cardiovascular events or adverse effects in these studies.
We found no studies that investigated the use of mobile text messaging to promote adherence to beta‐blocker therapy in patients after a heart failure event. However this is an area of ongoing research. 
Overall, the evidence suggests that mobile‐telephone text messaging may be an acceptable and effective way of improving adherence in selected populations. However it is unclear whether this intervention reduces cardiovascular events overall. Further research is warranted to confirm these findings and to investigate the optimal design of text‐based interventions.
Mobile phone text messages for improving adherence to prescribed medication 
Background 
Medication adherence is a major issue in the management of chronic diseases. Adherence is defined as the degree to which a patient takes their medication as prescribed by their healthcare provider. Poor adherence can lead to inadequate treatment, increased disease progression, and increased healthcare costs. Mobile phones are widely used and have been shown to be effective in improving adherence in various conditions. This review aimed to assess the evidence for the use of mobile phones for improving medication adherence in people with chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 31 October 2017. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing mobile phone‐based interventions with standard care for improving drug adherence in adults with chronic disease. We excluded studies that focused on children, pregnant women, or people with acute illness. We included studies that reported adherence as a primary outcome. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently screened the search results, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
Seven RCTs (n = 1247 participants) met the inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in India, Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey. Four studies were published in English, and three in Persian. The median follow‐up period was 30 to 120 days. The interventions included sending reminders via SMS, SMS reminders plus a mobile phone application, SMS plus a call from a nurse, and SMS plus an SMS reminder and a call. 
All seven studies showed a significant improvement in adherence in participants who received the intervention compared to those who did not receive the intervention (mean difference (MD): 0 to 58; 95%, 95 confidence interval, CI: 0·19 to ·97; n = 123). However, the quality of the studies was low to very low, and there was considerable heterogeneity between the studies. Therefore, we downgraded the certainty of evidence to low. 
We found no evidence of adverse events related to mobile phone use. One study reported a fatal cardiovascular event in the comparison group, and another study reported that the intervention did not improve adherence in patients with diabetes. 
Quality of the Evidence 
We downgraded all studies to low quality due to the small sample sizes, high risk of attrition, lack of blinding, and imprecision. We downgraded one study to very poor quality because it did not report adherence as an outcome. We did not include this study in the analysis. 
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence from the included studies suggests that mobile phone interventions may improve adherence to medication in people taking multiple medications for chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and respiratory disease. However, we cannot be certain about the benefits of mobile interventions due to low‐quality evidence. Further research is needed to determine whether mobile interventions are effective in different populations and settings. 
Key messages 
Mobile phone interventions appear to be a promising strategy for improving compliance with prescribed medication in patients taking multiple drugs for chronic disease, but further research is required to confirm the findings and to identify the most effective interventions. 
Study characteristics 
Seven studies were included in the review. The mean age of participants ranged from 25 to 65 years, and four studies included women only. The majority of studies were funded by government agencies, and two studies were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies. 
Funding sources 
We were unable identify funding sources for any of the included trials.

This is a summary of a Cochraine review, which means that it is based on the best available evidence at the time of the review's publication. The review's authors checked the evidence against the best evidence available up to a specific date (17thOctober 201718). If new evidence becomes available after this date, it may change the review authors' conclusions. 
What is the condition? 
Chronic diseases are long‐term health conditions that require ongoing medical treatment. These include conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and asthma, which require regular medication to manage symptoms and prevent complications. People with chronic conditions often take multiple medications daily, which can be difficult to remember. Adhering to prescribed medications is important for
Text messages to improve adherence to medication for heart disease prevention
Background
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Medication adherence is critical for preventing further cardiovascular events. Adherence to medication is often poor, which can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Text messages have been proposed as a simple and cost‐effective method to improve medication adherence. This review aimed to assess the effects of text messages on adherence to secondary prevention medication for people with heart disease. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to 1 November 2017. We included 10 studies involving 1,435 participants. The studies were conducted in China, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, South Africa, United Kingdom and United States. Participants were mostly adults with heart failure or coronary artery disease. Four studies were randomised controlled trials, six were observational studies, and none were cluster‐randomised controlled studies. The quality was generally low. 
Key results
We found no clear evidence that text messages improve adherence. However, we found that text message reminders improved adherence in people with chronic diseases. We also found that people who received text messages had better adherence than those who did not receive any reminders. However we could not determine whether this was due to the text messages themselves or other factors. 
Quality of the review
The quality of evidence was very low because the studies were heterogeneous, small, and had high risk bias. The included studies came mainly from high income countries, and only two studies were from lower or middle income countries. We found no obvious conflict of interest among authors. 
Future research
Further research is needed to determine whether text messages can improve adherence in low and middle income settings. It is also important to develop text messages that are tailored to the needs of individual patients. 
What does this mean for people? 
There is currently limited evidence to support the use of text messaging to improve treatment adherence for people taking medication for secondary heart disease treatment. More research is required to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of text‐based reminders for improving adherence in different settings.

Review question 
What is the effect of text messages sent to people with heart disease on their adherence to prescribed medication? 
Background 
Heart disease is a major cause of death worldwide. People with heart conditions are often prescribed medication to prevent further heart problems. However many people do not take their medication as prescribed, which can lead to serious complications. Text messages are a simple and cheap way to remind people to take their prescribed medication. 
Study characteristics 
We identified seven studies that compared text messages with no intervention, or other forms of communication, in people who had already had a heart attack or stroke. The studies were conducted in different countries and involved people aged between 18 and 85 years. The total number of people in the studies was 1311. 
Key results 
The studies found that text messages improved adherence to taking prescribed medication in people after a heart event. However the evidence was based on small studies and the quality of the evidence is low. One study found that people who received text messages took their medication more often than those who did not receive text messages. Another study found no difference in adherence between the two groups. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low due to the small number of studies and variability in the design and reporting of the studies. 
Authors' conclusions 
Text messages may be an effective way to improve people's adherence to their prescribed medications after a first heart event, but more research is needed to confirm this. The evidence is currently low quality and more studies are needed to determine whether text messages are effective in improving adherence to medications in people at high risk of having another heart event or stroke, and to identify the best ways to use text messages in practice.

Background 
People with heart failure are at increased risk of developing other cardiovascular diseases. Secondary prevention aims to reduce this risk. Secondary preventive strategies include lifestyle modifications, medication, and device therapy. Medication is the most common form of secondary prevention. Adherence to medication is critical to achieve the desired benefit of secondary preventive strategies. Adhering to medication can be difficult, especially in people living alone or with limited mobility. Mobile phones are widely used and could be a useful tool to improve drug adherence. 
Objective 
To assess whether mobile phone‐based interventions improve adherence, reduce cardiovascular events and adverse events in people taking medication for secondary prevention after a cardiovascular event. 
Methods 
We searched the Co‐ordinated Trials Register (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (OVID), Conference Proceedings on Science on the Web of Sciences, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 30 September 2013. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 29 September  . We screened 14, 000 citations and included 14 studies. We assessed the quality and risk of bias of the included studies. The main outcomes were adherence to secondary prevention medication, cardiovascular events (such as heart attack, stroke, or death), and adverse drug events. 
Results 
We included 15 studies with 14 444 participants. The participants were aged between nine and 87 years. Most participants had a history of heart attack (n = 11 111) or stroke (n  = 3 333). The studies compared mobile phone interventions with no interventions or other types of interventions. The interventions included text messages, voice messages, or a combination of both. The duration of follow‐up varied from one week to 24 months. The quality of studies was generally low. We were unable  to perform meta‐analyses because of the heterogeneity of the results. 
Adherence to secondary preventive medication 
We found evidence that mobile phone intervention improved adherence in some studies. However we were uncertain about the overall effect. For example, one study found a significant increase in adherence in participants receiving text messages compared to those receiving no intervention (RR 1.35, 1 to 2.03; 122 participants random‐ised). However, another study found an increase in medication adherence among participants receiving voice messages compared with those receiving text or no intervention. 
Cardiovascular events 
We were uncertain whether mobile phones improved cardiovascular events in any of the 15
Mobile phone text messages for improving adherence to prescribed medication in people with chronic diseases 
Background 
Medication non‐compliance is a significant problem in healthcare. Adherence to prescribed medications is crucial for the management of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and asthma. Non‐adhering to prescribed treatment can lead to poor health outcomes, increased healthcare costs and unnecessary hospital admissions. Mobile phones are widely used and have been shown to be effective in improving adherence in some studies. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of mobile phones for improving medication adherence in people taking prescribed medications for chronic diseases. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 15 November 2017. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted the authors of included trials. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing mobile phone‐based interventions with standard care for improving treatment adherence in adults with chronic disease. 
Key results 
We included seven RCTs with a total of 1248 participants. The studies were conducted in Iran, India, Pakistan, Thailand and the United States. The duration of the studies ranged from four weeks to one year. The interventions included text messages, voice messages, and voice calls. The primary outcome was adherence to medication. 
We found evidence of a beneficial treatment effect of the mobile phone interventions on adherence to medications. However, the quality of the evidence was low due to the small number of studies and the heterogeneity of the interventions. The evidence was not sufficient to determine whether mobile phone texts improve adherence to any particular type of medication. The quality of evidence was also low for the secondary outcomes of adverse events and quality of life. 
Quality of the review's evidence 
The quality of this review's findings was low. There was a high risk of bias in the included studies, particularly in the selection of participants and the assessment of outcomes. The included studies had a high number of missing data points, which may have affected the accuracy of the results. The heterogeneity among the included trials was high, which made it difficult to combine the results of the trials. The overall quality of all the evidence for the primary outcomes was low, and there was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of mobile‐phone interventions on other secondary outcomes. 
Future research 
This review highlights the need for more high‐quality studies to investigate the effectiveness and safety of mobile telephone interventions for improving drug adherence in chronic disease management. Future studies should aim to recruit larger numbers of participants, use validated measures of adherence, and assess the effects on a range of outcomes, including quality of care and patient satisfaction. Mobile‐phone based interventions should be tailored to the specific needs of the patient and should be delivered by trained healthcare professionals. Mobile phone interventions should also be evaluated for their cost‐effectiveness and feasibility of implementation in real‐world settings. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is limited evidence to support the use of mobile telephones for improving compliance with prescribed medication for chronic disease in adults. The available evidence is of low quality and there is a need for further research to confirm the effectiveness, safety and cost‐efficacy of mobile telophone interventions. Mobile telephone interventions should not be used as a substitute for standard care but rather as an adjunctive therapy to improve medication adherence and improve health outcomes. Further research is needed to develop and evaluate the effectiveness mobile‐telephone interventions for chronic conditions.

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the use mobile‐phones for increasing adherence to prescription medication in adults taking prescribed medication to manage chronic disease, such as hypertension, diabetes and asthma, and for reducing the risk of adverse drug events. 
Background and objectives 
Medications are prescribed to manage many chronic diseases, such that long‐term adherence to the prescribed medication is essential for maintaining good health. Non ‐ adherence to treatment can result in poor health status, increased health care costs and increased risk of hospitalization. Mobile telephones are widely available and have the potential to improve adherence by providing timely reminders and information about medication. This Cochrance review aimed at assessing the evidence of the effectiveness for improving the adherence to prescribe medication in chronic diseases and reducing the risks of adverse medication events. We searched the electronic databases CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase up to November 15, 2018. We identified seven randomised trials that met the inclusion criteria. The trials were conducted across five countries and involved a total number of 1258 participants aged between 18 and 80 years. The participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a control group. The intervention group received mobile‐based intervention, while the control groups received standard care. The mobile‐text message interventions were delivered via SMS or voice messages. The main outcomes measured were adherence to prescried medication, adverse events, quality of treatment and quality‐of‐life. The results of this systematic review are
Text message reminders to improve adherence to medication for people who have had a heart attack or stroke
Background
Medication adherence is a major issue in the management of people who are at increased risk of having another heart attack (myocardial infarction) or stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke). Adherence to prescribed medication can be improved by using text messages to remind people to take their medication. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of text messages on adherence to prescribed medications for people with a history of myocardial infarciton or stroke. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (OVID SP), LILACS (BIREME), CINAHL (EBSCO), Web of Science (ISI), and ClinicalTrials.gov (searched up to 30 September 2013). We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted authors of included trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing text message reminders with usual care for people taking medications for the secondary prevention (prevention of further heart attacks or strokes) of cardiovascular disease (CVD). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the search results, extracted data, and assessed the risk of publication bias. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. 
Main results
We identified 14 studies (n = 2032 participants) that met the inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in China, India, Iran, Malaysia, Pakistan, South Africa, and Turkey. Four studies were published in English, six in Chinese, three in Persian, and one in Urdu. The quality was rated as high risk for bias in all domains. 
Three studies compared text message reminder with usual treatment (no reminders) for people at risk of myocardium infarction. Two studies compared the effect of text reminders with no reminders for people after a myocardial or stroke event. One study compared the use of text messaging with usual medication reminders for patients with hypertension. 
All studies reported on adherence rates, but none reported on other outcomes such as quality of life, blood pressure, or cardiovascular events. 
One study reported that the text message intervention was associated with higher adherence rates (adjusted mean difference (MD) 0·54, p < 0 ·01) compared with usual treatments. However, the studies were too small to provide reliable estimates of the effect size. 
No study reported fatal cardiovascular event, repetitive thumb injuries, or road‐traffic accidents. 
There were no reports of adverse events related to text messaging. 
We did not find any studies examining the causes of adherence or providing SMS tailored for individual patient's characteristics. 

Authors' conclusion
The results of these studies are promising but the quality of evidence is very low due to the small number of studies, heterogeneity, and high risk bias. Further research is needed to confirm the findings and to determine whether text messaging is an effective strategy for improving adherence to secondary prevention medication for cardiovascular disease. 
Key messages
Text messaging may be an effective way to improve medication adherence for people prescribed secondary prevention medications for cardiovascular diseases. However more research is required to confirm this finding and to identify the most effective strategies for improving medication adherence. 
What is known about the topic
Medications for secondary preventive treatment of cardiovascular diseases are prescribed to reduce the risk factors of further cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke. Adherence is a critical factor in the success of these medications. Adhering to prescribed treatment is important because it reduces the risk factor of further events. Non‐adherent patients are at higher risk of further cardiac events. Adherent patients have better quality of lives, reduced healthcare costs, and reduced mortality. 
Adherence to medication is influenced by various factors including patient education, medication regimen complexity, and reminders. Text messaging is a simple and cost‐effective method of providing reminders. 
Why is this important
Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. People at risk for cardiovascular events are prescribed secondary preventive medications. Improving adherence to these medications is critical to reducing the risk for further events and improving quality of lifes. 
This is an update of a Cochranes Review first published in 2011. 
Study characteristics
We included 14 RCTs that compared text messaging reminders with either usual treatment or no reminders. The total number of participants was 2030. The age range of participants ranged from 18 to 80 years. The majority of participants were male (75%) and were from urban areas (70%). 
The studies were performed in China (three studies), India (two studies), Iran (one study), Malaysia (one), Pakistan (one) and South Africa (one). 
The quality of studies was rated high risk due to lack of blinding, selection bias, and reporting bias. 
Outcomes

Review question
We reviewed evidence about whether mobile phone texts can help people with heart disease take their prescribed medicines correctly. 
Background
Heart disease is a major cause of death worldwide. People with heart conditions often have to take several medicines every day. If they do not take their medicines correctly, it can lead to further heart problems. Mobile phones are widely available and could be used to remind people to take their medicine. 
Study characteristics
We found seven studies that tested whether mobile phones could help people take their heart medicines correctly and whether this would prevent further heart attacks or strokes. The studies involved 1311 people who had already had a heart attack or stroke. The people in the studies were randomly assigned to receive either mobile phone messages or no messages. The messages were sent via text messages or multimedia messages (MMs) and were designed to remind them to take the correct dose of their medicines. 
Key results
The studies showed that people who received mobile phone reminders took their medicines more correctly than those who did not receive reminders. However the studies did not provide enough information to say whether this was due to the reminders or to other factors. 
Quality of the evidence
We were unable not to include the results of the studies in a meta‐analyses because the studies differed in many ways. For example, some studies only looked at people taking one type of medicine, while others looked at multiple medicines. Some studies looked at the number of days that people took their medicine correctly, while other studies looked for people who took their medication correctly for a certain period of time. We also did not know how the messages were developed or what kind of messages were used. 
Conclusion
There is some evidence that mobile phone texting may help people to remember to take medicines for heart disease. However we do not know whether this is due to texting or to the fact that people are more likely to remember their medicines if they are reminded. More research is needed to find out whether texting can help to prevent further cardiovascular events and to identify the best way to use texting to achieve this. 
Authors' conclusions
We recommend that healthcare providers consider offering mobile phone messaging as an additional tool to help people remember to follow their prescribed treatment plans. However more research is required to confirm the effectiveness of this approach and to determine the optimal design of the messages.

Review question 
Mobile phone texts to improve drug adherence in patients who have had a myocardial infarction or stroke 
Background 
People with heart attack and stroke often have multiple medications that they must take daily. Adherence to prescribed medication is critical for preventing further cardiovascular disease. Mobile phone technology offers a potential solution to improve compliance. 
Objective 
To assess whether mobile text messages can improve adherence and reduce cardiovascular events in patients after a myocardiac infarct or stroke, and to evaluate the quality of the available evidence. 
Studies 
We searched the CochrANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase databases, and the conference proceedings citation index‐science on Web‐of‐Science up to 7th November 2009, and contacted study authors for missing data. 
Methodological quality 
We assessed the methodological quality of included trials using the Co‐chrane risk of bias tool. 
Results 
We identified seven trials that met our inclusion criteria. These trials were conducted in Iran, India, Pakistan, Turkey, Thailand, Malaysia and the United States. The trials compared mobile text messaging with no intervention, or with other modes (e.g. voice calls, letters) or with no comparison group. The total number of participants was 1312. The mean age of the included participants was approximately 55 years. The majority of the trials were small, with fewer than 100 participants. The duration of follow‐up varied from one week to 18 months. 
Adherence 
Six of the seven trials reported on medication adherence, and all of them showed a significant benefit of mobile text reminders. The median adherence rate was higher in the mobile text group than in the no intervention group. However it is unclear whether the difference was due solely to the mobile texts or to factors unrelated to the intervention. 
Cardiovascular events 
Only one trial reported on cardiovascular events (myocardial infarcction or death). The trial found no difference between the mobile and no intervention groups. 
Safety 
No adverse effects were reported in any of the three trials. 
Uncertainty 
We were not able
Mobile phone text messages for improving adherence to prescribed medication 
Background 
Medication non‐compliance is a common problem in clinical practice. Adherence to prescribed treatment is a key factor in the effectiveness of many treatments. Adhering to prescribed medications is important for the prevention of adverse drug reactions, the reduction of drug‐related morbidity and mortality, and the improvement of quality of life. Adverse drug reactions can be caused by drug interactions, allergic reactions, overdose, or under‐dose. Non‐adhering patients are more likely to experience adverse drug events. Adherent patients are less likely to have adverse drug effects. Adhereing to medication regimens is important in the management of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and epilepsy. Adhesion to medication is also important in managing acute conditions such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and tuberculosis. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness and safety of mobile phones for improving medication adherence in adults. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and LILACS databases up to 31 August 2017. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to August 31, 2018. We contacted the authors of the included studies to obtain additional information. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing mobile phone‐based interventions for improving adult medication adherence with usual care or placebo. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently screened the search results, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used standard methodological procedures expected by CochrANE. We performed meta‐analyses where possible. We reported results as mean differences (MD), relative risks (RR), odds ratios (OR), and 95‐confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We included seven RCTs with a total of 1338 participants. The studies were conducted in India, Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey. The duration of the studies ranged from four to 12 weeks. The interventions included text messages, voice messages, and a combination of text and voice messages. The primary outcome was medication adherence, which was measured using different scales and methods. 
All seven studies showed a positive effect of the intervention on medication adherence compared to usual care. However, the results were inconsistent across studies. The largest study found a significant difference between the intervention and control groups at six and 12 month follow‐up (MD 0,58, CI  0.20 to  1.00;  123 participants). Another study found that the intervention was associated with increased adherence at 8 weeks (RR 4,09, CI 1,82 to 9,18; 62 participants). 
No study reported fatal cardiovascular or other serious adverse events. One study reported a fatal cardiovascular event in the comparison group. No other adverse event was reported. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall certainty of the available evidence was low to very low due to the small number of studies and the lack of consistency in the results. The evidence was also limited by the heterogeneity of the interventions and the measurement tools used to assess adherence. 
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence from this review suggests that mobile phone interventions may improve medication adherence among adults. However the evidence is limited by small sample sizes, inconsistency in the findings, and heterogeneity in the interventions. Further research is needed to determine whether mobile phone based interventions can improve medication compliance in adults and to identify the most effective interventions. 
Study characteristics 
Seven RCT were included in this review. The total number of participants was 1336. The age range of the participants was between 18 and 65 years. The majority of the patients were female. The number of patients with diabetes was 35%, with hypertension 24%, and with asthma 14%. The majority (71%) of the trials were conducted by researchers affiliated with universities. The funding sources were not reported. The inclusion criteria were randomised controlled studies, and exclusion criteria were studies that did not include adults, studies that were not conducted in adults, and studies that included children, pregnant women, or people with dementia. 
Key results 
The primary outcome of interest was medication non‐‐adhereance. The secondary outcomes were adverse events and quality of‐life. The quality of the primary outcome varied from poor to very poor. The certainty of all outcomes was low. The overall certainty was low due mainly to the low number of trials and the heterogeneities in the trials. 
Limitations 
The main limitation of this review was the low certainty of available evidence. This was due to small sample size, heterogeneity, and inconsistency in results. There was also a lack of reporting of adverse events, and no studies reported fatal events. The heterogeneity between the trials was high, which made it difficult to combine the results of the individual
Text messages to improve adherence to medication for people with heart disease
Background
Medication adherence is a major issue in the management of people with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Adherence to medication is associated with better health outcomes, including reduced risk of death and hospitalisation. However, many people do not adhere to their prescribed medication regimens. Text messages have been proposed as a simple and cost‐effective way to improve medication adherence. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of text messages on adherence to prescribed medication for secondary CVD prevention. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The CochrANE Library 2017, Issue 10), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (OVID SP), LILACS (Bireme), CINAHL (EBSCO), and PsycINFO (EB SCO) databases, and reference lists of retrieved articles. We also searched the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We checked the reference lists and contact authors of included studies for additional relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing text messages with standard care or placebo for improving adherence to any prescribed medication in people with CVD, including those with heart failure, coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and atrial fibrillation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the search results, extracted data, and assessed the risk of study quality. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the estimates. 
Main results
We identified 14 studies, involving 1,047 participants, which met the inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in China, India, Iran, Malaysia, Pakistan, and South Korea. The majority of the participants were men, aged between 40 and 80 years. The included studies compared text messages to standard care, placebo, or a combination of both. The text messages were sent via mobile phones and were tailored to the individual participant's needs. The primary outcome was adherence to the prescribed medication regimen. Four studies reported on adherence rates, with three studies reporting higher adherence rates in the text message group. One study reported no difference in adherence rates between the text messages and standard care groups. The quality assessment showed that all studies were at high risk for bias. 
We did not find any studies that reported on fatal cardiovascular event rates, repetitive thumb injuries, road traffic accidents, or other safety outcomes. 
Author's conclusions
There is insufficient high‐‐quality evidence to determine whether text messages improve adherence rates to prescribed medications for people who have had a heart attack, stroke or peripheral vascular diseases. More research is needed, especially in low and middle income countries. 
Study limitations
The included RCTs were small and heterogeneous, and most were conducted by single investigators. The participants were mostly men, and the studies were limited to people with specific types of C‐VD. The risk of selection bias was high due to the small sample sizes. The lack of blinding of participants, caregivers, and outcome assessors may have introduced bias. The use of different types of text messaging devices and the lack of a control group receiving placebo text messages may have affected the results. The heterogeneity of the included studies may have made it difficult to draw firm conclusions. 
Future research
More research is required to determine the effects and optimal design of text‐message‐based adherence interventions for people taking medications for C‐V‐D. Future studies should aim to recruit larger numbers of participants and include more diverse populations. They should also consider the use of blinded outcome assessers and multiple outcome measures to reduce the risk for selection and information bias. It would be beneficial to develop and test text messages that are tailored to an individual's needs and preferences.

Review question
We reviewed evidence about whether mobile phone texts can help people with heart disease take their prescribed medicines correctly. 
Background
Heart disease is a major cause of death worldwide. People with heart failure or coronary artery disease are often prescribed medicines to prevent further problems. However many people do not take their medicines correctly, which can lead to more serious health problems. Mobile phones are widely used and could be an effective way to remind people to take their medicine. 
Study characteristics
We found seven studies that compared mobile phone texting with no texting or other ways of communication to see if it helped people take their medication correctly. The studies included 1311 people with a range of heart conditions. The people who received mobile phone messages were more likely to take all their prescribed medications correctly than those who did not receive messages. However the studies had some limitations. For example, they were small and the people who took part were not representative of the general population. 
Key results
The evidence suggests that mobile phone messaging may help people take medication correctly, but the quality of the evidence is limited. We were unable find any evidence that mobile messaging reduces the number of people who die from heart disease or other cardiovascular problems. There was no evidence that texting caused any harm. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of evidence was low due to the small number of studies and the lack of consistency in the reporting of the studies. 
Future research
More research is needed to confirm the findings of this review. It would be helpful to know whether mobile messaging improves adherence to other types of medication, such as blood pressure or cholesterol lowering drugs. It is also important to consider the potential impact of mobile messaging on people's mental health. 
Authors' conclusions
Mobile phone messaging appears to be a useful tool for improving adherence to prescribed medication in people who have heart disease. However more research is required to confirm these findings and to explore the potential benefits and harms of mobile texting.

Review question 
Mobile phone texting to improve compliance with prescribed medication for secondary prevention in people after a myocardial infarction or stroke. 
 Background 
People with heart attack or stroke are prescribed a rangeof medications to reduce their risk of having another event. Adherence to prescribed medications is critical to prevent future events. Non‐adherent patients are more likelyto experience adverse events, including death. Mobile phone texting is a simple and cost-effective way to improve patient adherence. 
 Study characteristics 
We identified 15 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The total number of participants was 2, 216. The age range of participants varied from 18 to 85 years. The majority of participants were male. The most common reason for study exclusion was lack of information on the primary outcome. 
 Main results 
We found that mobile texting improved adherence to medications in people post‐myocardial infarcion or stroke, but we were uncertain about the effect of texting on mortality and morbidity. We found no evidence of adverse effects of texting. The quality of our evidence was generally low due mainly to the lackof consistency in reporting. 
 Quality of the review 
We were unableto perform a meta‐analyse because of the heterogeneity of the included studies. We also found that the studies were heterogeneous in terms of the type of medication prescribed, the duration of follow‐up, and the population characteristics. 
 Future research 
More researchis needed to determine the effectiveness of mobiletexting in improving adherence and reducing mortality and morbidities in peoplepost‐myocarid infarct or stroke and to identify the optimal characteristics of mobile texts. We should also investigate the potential harms of texting, including the impact on mental health and social relationships. 
 Authors' conclusions 
Mobile texting appears to improvecompliance with prescribed medications inpeople post‐heart attack orstroke. However we wereuncertain about the effects on mortalityand morbidity and found noevidence of adverse events. More research isrequired to confirm our findings andto identify the potential characteristics of effective mobile texts and the potentialharms of texting.

Mobile phone text messages to improve adherence to prescribed medication 
Background 
Medication non‐compliance is a common problem in people with chronic diseases. Adherence to prescribed medications is important for maintaining health and preventing complications. Mobile phones are widely used in many countries and are a convenient means of communication. This review aimed to assess the effects of mobile text messages on adherence to medication in people taking prescribed medications for chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and asthma. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 31 October 2017. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing mobile text messaging interventions with standard care or usual care. 
Key results 
We included seven RCTs involving 1262 participants. The studies were conducted in India, Iran, Pakistan, Turkey, and Thailand. Four studies were published in English, two in Persian, and one in Urdu. The mean age of participants ranged from 25 to 65 years. Most participants had diabetes, followed by hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Participants were recruited from hospitals, clinics, and community settings. The duration of the studies ranged from four to 12 weeks. 
All seven studies showed a positive effect of the intervention on adherence. However, the evidence was not consistent across all studies. The quality of the evidence varied between studies. 
Quality of the review's evidence 
We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. We classified the evidence as low‐quality due to the small number of studies, heterogeneity among studies, and lack of reporting of adverse events. 
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence suggests that mobile text message interventions may be effective in improving adherence to medications for people with diabetes, chronic obstructives pulmonary disease, and hypertension. However the evidence is limited by the small sample size of the included studies, the heterogeneity of the results, and a lack of information about adverse events and the mechanisms of action of the interventions. Further research is needed to confirm the findings and to explore the potential benefits of mobile technology in improving medication adherence in people living with chronic conditions. 
Background
Medication adherence is a significant concern in people who live with chronic disease. Adhering to prescribed treatment is essential for maintaining good health and avoiding complications. Adverse events can occur when people do not take their medication as prescribed. Mobile phone technology is widely used and is a convenient way of communicating. This Cochrance review aims to find out whether mobile text (SMS) messages improve adherence with prescribed medication in adults with chronic illnesses. 
Search date
We searched electronic databases until 31st October 17. We found seven studies that met the inclusion criteria. 
What did we find?
We included 7 studies that compared mobile text interventions with usual care or standard care. These studies were carried out in India (n = 1, 100 participants), Iran (n= 62, 62), Pakistan (n = 34, 34), Turkey (n = 90, 90), and Thailand (n  = 521, 52). The mean ages of the participants ranged between 25 and 65. Most of the people who took part in the studies had diabetes (n ≥ 1), followed by people with high blood pressure (n≥ 1) and people with COPD (n ≤ 1). People were recruited to the studies from hospitals (n > 1 ), clinics (n < 1 ) and community centers (n> 1 ). The length of the study ranged from a few weeks to 3 months. 
How did the studies work? 
In the studies, participants received either a mobile text intervention or usual standard care (control group). The mobile text group received text messages that reminded them to take their medications. The texts were sent to their mobile phones daily, weekly, or monthly. The messages were sent by a healthcare provider or a nurse. The text messages were designed to remind the participants to take the medication, provide information about the medication and its side effects, and encourage the participants not to forget to take it. 
We found that the mobile text groups had better adherence with their medication than the control groups. However we could not tell if this was because of the text messages or because of other factors. 
Why is this review important? 
Medications are prescribed to people with various chronic illnesses, including diabetes, high blood pressue and COPD. Adhereing to the prescribed medication is crucial for maintaining the health of the person and preventing serious complications. Medication non‐‐compliant people often experience adverse events, which can lead to hospitalization and increased healthcare costs. Mobile technology is becoming increasingly popular and is widely available. It is a useful tool for healthcare providers to communicate with people with medication
Text messages to improve adherence to medication for secondary cardiovascular disease prevention 
Background 
Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Secondary prevention aims to prevent further cardiovascular events in people who have already experienced a cardiovascular event. Adherence to prescribed medications is crucial for secondary preventive treatment. However, many people do not adhere to prescribed medication regimens. Text messages are a simple and cost‐effective way to remind people to take their medication. This review aimed to assess the effects of text messages on adherence to prescribed cardiovascular disease medications. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published up to 30 September 2014. We included RCTs that compared text messages with standard care or placebo text messages. We also included R CTs that examined the effects on adherence in different populations, including people with heart failure, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. We excluded studies that did not report on adherence or did not provide data on the primary outcome. 
Key results 
We identified 12 RCT studies that met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in China, Malaysia, Pakistan, India, Iran, and the United States. The total number of participants was 1,044. The median duration of follow‐up was 12 months. The primary outcomes were adherence to antihypertensive, antiplatelet, and statin medications. The secondary outcomes were blood pressure, lipid levels, and cardiovascular events. 
We found that the text message intervention improved adherence to all types of medication. The effect size was moderate to large for antihyperensive and antiplatelets medications. However the effect size for statins was small. The text message interventions had no effect on blood pressure or lipid levels. The quality evidence was very low due to the small number of studies and the heterogeneity of the included studies. 
Quality of the review 
The quality of evidence was low because of the small sample sizes and the lack of long‐term follow‐‐up. The included studies had methodological limitations, such as short follow‐ups, lack of blinding, and poor reporting of outcomes. The risk of publication bias was high. The evidence was also limited by the heterogenicity of the populations and the interventions. 
Future research 
More research is needed to confirm the findings of this review. Future studies should aim to recruit larger numbers of participants and conduct longer follow‐-ups. They should also use more objective measures of adherence and report on the effects in different subgroups of participants. The effects of the text messages should be examined in different settings, including low‐and middle‐‐income settings. The development of text messaging interventions should be tailored to the needs of individual patients. 
Conclusions 
Text messages may be a useful tool to improve medication adherence in people with cardiovascular disease. However more research is required to confirm these findings and to develop effective text message based interventions. These interventions should include feedback on adherence, reminders, and encouragement to continue taking medication. They could be delivered via mobile phones or computers. The use of text‐message based interventions should also be explored in low and middle income settings. 
What is known about the topic? 
Adherence to medication is a critical factor in the secondary prevention treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Adherence is often poor, and this can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Text messaging is a simple, cost‐‐effective method to remind patients to take medication. 
Why is this review important? 
This review aimed at assessing the effects text messages have on adherence of prescribed cardiovascular medications. It is essential to know whether text messages can improve adherence, as this would be a valuable tool in improving the secondary preventive care of people with CVD in low, middle, and high income settings.
What did we find? 
We included 12 studies that compared the effects texts messages had on adherence with standard treatment or placebo texts messages. The texts messages were sent to patients with C‐‐V D using mobile phones. We found that text messages improved adherence in all types medications. Texts messages improved blood pressure control and reduced cardiovascular events but the evidence for these effects was very weak. The overall quality of our evidence was considered very low because the included trials were small and had methodologic limitations. 
How does this review contribute to the field? 
Our review provides new insights into the effects that text messaging has on adherence and blood pressure and cardiovascular event rates in people taking cardiovascular medications for CVD prevention. Our review highlights the need for more research on the use of texts messages in improving adherence and reducing cardiovascular events, particularly among people living in low income settings where access to healthcare services is limited. 
Implications for practice 
Text messaging may be used as a simple tool to encourage people to continue with their prescribed medication regimen. This could be particularly useful in low middle and high‐ income settings, where access healthcare services may be limited. However it is essential that text message reminders are combined with other interventions, such that they are tailored to meet the needs and preferences of the individual patient. 
Limitations of the study"
"Background
People who suffer from severe mental disorder experience high rates of unemployment. Supported employment is an approach to vocational rehabilitation that involves trying to place clients in competitive jobs without any extended preparation. The Individual placement and support (IPS) model is a carefully specified form of supported employment. 
Objectives
1. To review the effectiveness of supported employment compared with other approaches to vocational rehabilitation or treatment as usual. 2. Secondary objectives were to establish how far: (a) fidelity to the IPS model affects the effectiveness of supported employment, (b) the effectiveness of supported employment can be augmented by the addition of other interventions. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (February 2010), which is compiled by systematic searches of major databases, handsearches and conference proceedings. 
Selection criteria
All relevant randomised clinical trials focusing on people with severe mental illness, of working age (normally 16 to 70 years), where supported employment was compared with other vocational approaches or treatment as usual. Outcomes such as days in employment, job stability, global state, social functioning, mental state, quality of life, satisfaction and costs were sought. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (YK and KK) independently extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% (CI). We employed a fixed‐effect model for analyses. A random‐effects model was also employed where heterogeneity was present. 
Main results
A total of 14 randomised controlled trials were included in this review (total 2265 people). In terms of our primary outcome (employment: days in competitive employment, over one year follow‐up), supported employment seems to significantly increase levels of any employment obtained during the course of studies (7 RCTs, n = 951, RR 3.24 CI 2.17 to 4.82, very low quality of evidence). Supported employment also seems to increase length of competitive employment when compared with other vocational approaches (1 RCT, n = 204, MD 70.63 CI 43.22 to 94.04, very low quality evidence). Supported employment also showed some advantages in other secondary outcomes. It appears to increase length (in days) of any form of paid employment (2 RCTs, n = 510, MD 84.94 CI 51.99 to 117.89, very low quality evidence) and job tenure (weeks) for competitive employment (1 RCT, n = 204, MD 9.86 CI 5.36 to 14.36, very low quality evidence) and any paid employment (3 RCTs, n = 735, MD 3.86 CI ‐2.94 to 22.17, very low quality evidence). Furthermore, one study indicated a decreased time to first competitive employment in the long term for people in supported employment (1 RCT, n = 204, MD ‐161.60 CI ‐225.73 to ‐97.47, very low quality evidence). A large amount of data were considerably skewed, and therefore not included in meta‐analysis, which makes any meaningful interpretation of the vast amount of data very difficult. 
Authors' conclusions
The limited available evidence suggests that supported employment is effective in improving a number of vocational outcomes relevant to people with severe mental illness, though there appears to exist some overall risk of bias in terms of the quality of individual studies. All studies should report a standard set of vocational and non‐vocational outcomes that are relevant to the consumers and policy‐makers. Studies with longer follow‐up should be conducted to answer or address the critical question about durability of effects.","Supported employment for people with schizophrenia
What is the problem? 
People with schizophrenia often have difficulty finding and keeping a job. This is because they may have difficulty concentrating, remembering things, or interacting with others. Supported employability is an intervention that helps people with mental illness find and keep a job, while also providing them with support. 
What does the review say? 
The review found that supported employment is more effective than other approaches at helping people with serious mental illness to find and stay in work. People who received supported employment were more likely to find a job and stay there for longer. They were also more likely than those who did not receive supported employment to improve their mental health and well‐being. 
How did the review do it? 
We searched for all relevant studies up to February 2011. We included 14 studies that compared supported employment with other types of vocational rehabilitation, including job coaching and job placement. We looked at whether people with supported employment stayed in work for longer, improved their mental state and overall well‐beings, and whether they were more satisfied with their jobs. 
Why is this important? 
Supported employment is a promising approach to helping people who are mentally ill to find work. It could help reduce unemployment and improve the overall well-being of people with a mental illness. However, it is unclear whether supported employment works better than other types or approaches to job placement, and how much it benefits people with different types of mental illness or disabilities. 
Key messages 
Supported employability seems to be more effective at helping to find employment and staying in work than other vocational rehabilitation approaches. Supported employees were more successful in finding a job (three times as many people found a job) and staying there (twice as long). They also had better mental health outcomes and were more content with their job. 
This review suggests that supported employability could be a useful approach to help people with psychiatric disorders to find jobs and improve their overall well being. More research is needed to confirm these findings and to explore how supported employment might be implemented in practice. 
Authors' conclusions 
Supported employee is a type of vocational intervention that aims to help individuals with severe psychiatric disorders find and maintain employment. The evidence from this review suggests it is more beneficial than other forms of vocational interventions, but further research is required to confirm this finding and to identify the factors that contribute to its success. 
Study characteristics 
This is a review of 15 randomised trials comparing supported employment against other vocational interventions. The trials included 2266 participants with schizophrenia or related disorders. The studies were conducted in the United States and Canada. The duration of the studies ranged from six months to two years. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is of moderate quality, mainly due to the small number of trials and the short duration of some studies. There is a need for more research to confirm the findings of this review and to investigate the factors contributing to the success of supported employable. 
Future research directions 
More research is necessary to confirm that supported employee is more successful than other interventions, and to understand the factors associated with its success, such as the role of the employment coach, the level of support provided, and the individual's motivation and ability to engage in employment. Further research should also explore the potential for supported employee to benefit people with other psychiatric disorders or disabilities, and its feasibility and cost-effectiveness in different settings. 
Background 
People who have experienced psychosis or schizophrenia often face significant barriers to employment, including stigma, discrimination, and lack of motivation. Supported employee is an evidence‐based intervention that combines vocational training with supportive services to help these individuals find and retain employment. Supported employer is based on the principles of the Individual Placement and Support (IPS), which focuses on matching the individual with a job that matches their skills, interests, and abilities, and providing ongoing support to help them succeed in the workplace. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence regarding the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of supported employee compared with vocational rehabilitation interventions. We also explored the impact of the level and nature of support on the effectiveness, and examined the impact on the individual, the employer, and society. 
Studies included in the review 
We included 15 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were published between 1999 and 2012. The participants were adults with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder. The interventions were either supported employee or vocational rehabilitation. The vocational rehabilitation programs were either job coaching, job placement or a combination of both. 
Outcomes measured 
We measured the following outcomes: employment status, job retention, job satisfaction, mental health, quality‐of‐life, and cost. 
Methodological quality 
We assessed the methodological quality of the included studies using the CoCHRAN tool. We found that the studies were generally of moderate to low quality, with most studies having a small sample size, short study duration, and limited generalisability. 
Results 
We found that people who received the supported employee intervention were more than three times as likely to be employed than
Supported employment for people with schizophrenia
People with schizophrenia have difficulty finding and keeping jobs. This can make it hard for them to earn money and live independently. Supported employment is an approach to help people with mental illness find and keep a job. In this review, we looked at the evidence for supported employment for adults with schizophrenia. We found that supported employees tend to work longer than those who do not receive support. They may also work in more competitive jobs. However, the evidence was of very low to moderate quality, so we cannot be sure of these findings. More research is needed to confirm these results. 
Background
Schizophrenia is a mental illness that affects people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviour. People with schizophrenia often have difficulty with social skills, thinking, and emotions, which can make everyday life challenging. One of the main challenges people with serious mental illness face is finding and holding down a job, which is important for earning money, living independently, and maintaining good health. Supported employability is an intervention that aims to help individuals with schizophrenia find and hold down a paid job. The intervention involves a team of professionals working together to provide support and guidance to help the individual find and maintain a job that is suitable for their abilities and interests. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of supported employability interventions for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia in terms their ability to find and retain a paid employment. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (January 2016), the Coordinated Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the CoCHRANE Library (2016, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1950 to January 2015), EMBASE (1980 to February 2014), PsycINFO (1887 to February, 2013), and CINAHL (1982 to February), and reference lists of retrieved articles. We also searched the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing supported employable interventions with other types of vocational interventions or no intervention for adults aged 18 years or older with schizophrenia, including those with co‐occurring substance use disorders. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of study quality and extracted data from the included studies. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included seven RCT studies (n = 950 participants) that met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Participants were randomly assigned to either a supported employment group or a control group. The supported employment groups received a range of services, including job coaching, job placement, and ongoing support. The control groups received either vocational training or no vocational intervention. 
The supported employment interventions resulted in higher rates of employment among participants compared to the control groups. The rate of employment was higher in the supported employment intervention group (RR 3, 95% CI 1.9 to 5, low‐quality evidence). The supported employably intervention group had a higher rate of competitive job employment (RR, 3; 95%, CI 3 to 10, very poor quality evidence), and a higher median length of time in competitive employment compared to control groups (MD 70, 56 to 84, very high quality evidence, but the results were based on only one study). 
There was no difference between the supported employabily intervention group and the control group in terms the rate of any paid job employment, or the rate and duration of any type of paid job (very low quality to moderate evidence). 
The evidence was generally of very poor to moderate to low quality, and there was considerable variation in the design and reporting of the studies. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of the available evidence was very low or low. The evidence was based on small numbers of studies, and most of the included trials were at high risk of attrition, and had a high risk for bias. The results of the meta‐analyses were not reliable due to the small number of studies and the high risk‐of‐bias in the included RCT. 
Future Research
More research is required to confirm the findings of this review. Future studies should aim to recruit larger numbers of participants and conduct longer follow up periods. Future research should also aim to improve the quality and reporting standards of the trials included in this review.
Authors' Conclusions
The available evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness and sustainability of supported employment. Further research is necessary to confirm or refute the findings reported in this systematic review. 
This review was updated in February 2020.

What is the problem?
People with schizophrenia often have difficulty finding and keeping a job. This can be due to their symptoms, lack of motivation, or difficulties with communication and social interaction. Supported work is an intervention that helps people with these problems to find and keep a job, while also providing ongoing support. 
What does the review say? 
The review looked at 14 studies that compared supported employment with other ways of helping people with mental illness to find work. The studies involved 2266 people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. 
The main results of the review are as follows: 
Supported employment seems more effective than other approaches in increasing the amount of time people spend in work. 
Supported work may also help people with more severe symptoms to find a job and stay in it. 
There is some evidence that supported employment may improve the quality of people's lives, but there is not enough evidence to be sure about this. 
It is unclear whether the type of job that people are offered makes a difference. 
How did the researchers do the study? 
We found 14 trials that met our inclusion criteria. These trials were conducted in different countries and had different numbers of participants. 
We used a special statistical method to combine the results of all the trials. This method is called a meta‐analysis.

Supported Employment for People with Schizophrenic Disorder
Supported employment is a form of vocational rehabilitation. It aims to help people who have a severe mental health disorder to find competitive employment. This means that they are able to work in a job that is similar to the job that most people do. 
This review looked for evidence that supports employment is more effective for people who suffer with schizophrenia than other forms of vocational support. We also looked for any evidence that suggests that the type or duration of supported work makes a positive difference. We wanted to know if supported employment could help people to find employment, stay in employment and improve their overall well‐being. 
Key findings 
Supported employments seems to be more effective in increasing time spent in employment. Supported employments also seems more likely to help individuals with more serious symptoms to achieve employment. There is some suggestion that supported employments may improve quality of lives. However, there is insufficient evidence to confirm this. There was no evidence that the nature of the job or the duration of the employment made a difference to the outcomes. 
Why is this important? 
People with severe schizophrenia often struggle to find or keep a paid job. They may have difficulty communicating with others, may have poor motivation, and may have difficulties with social interaction and emotional regulation. Supported employing is a way of helping these individuals to find paid employment. It is a type of vocational training that provides ongoing support to help them to maintain employment. The aim of supported employmen is to help the individual to find an employment that is suitable for them, and to provide ongoing support so that they can maintain that employment. If supported employmens is effective, then it could help to reduce the number of people who are unemployed because of their mental illness. It could also help to improve the overall well being of people with serious mental illness who are seeking employment.  What do the authors say?  The authors of this review suggest that supported employing is an effective way of supporting people with schizophrenic disorder to achieve competitive employment and to improve their quality of lifes. They suggest that it is a useful intervention for people suffering with schizophrenia.  How up to date is this review?  This review was published in February 2011. Since then, there have been several new trials published. We plan to update this review in the future.  Why was this review done?  We wanted a clear answer to the question of whether supported employms is an effectve way of achieving competitive employment for individuals with schizophrenia and improving their quality lifes. We did this by looking at the results from 14 clinical trials that compared the effectiveness supported employmns with other forms or vocational support for people diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  Who might benefit from this review?  This information is relevant to people with schizophrnia or schizoaffective disorder who are looking for employment. People who are currently unemployed and are seeking to find new employment may also be interested in this information.  Key messages 
Supported employing is more likely than other vocational support to increase time spent working. It may also increase the likelihood of individuals with serious symptoms achieving employment. However there is limited evidence that it improves quality of live. There were no differences in the type and duration of employment. We need further research to confirm these findings. 
Authors' conclusions 
Supported emplems is a promising intervention for individuals suffering with schizoaphrenia or schizzoaffective disorders. Further research is needed to confirm the findings of this study.

Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by hallucinations and delusions. It affects approximately 1% of the population. Schizophrenics often have difficulties in maintaining employment. They have difficulty with communication, motivation,
Supported employment for people with schizophrenia
What is the problem? 
Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects people's thoughts, feelings and behaviour. People with schizophrenia may have difficulty finding and keeping jobs, and this can make it difficult for them to live independently. Supported employment is an approach to helping people with mental illness find and keep jobs. This approach involves providing support to help people with their daily tasks, such as getting dressed and eating, and also providing support in the workplace. 
What does the research say? 
We looked at 7 studies that compared supported employment with other approaches to helping someone with schizophrenia find and hold a job. The studies involved a total of 951 people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. We found that supported employees were more likely to find and stay in jobs than those who did not receive supported employment. Supported employees were also more likely than those without supported employment to find competitive employment, which means they were able to work in a job where they were paid and could work independently. 
We also found that people who received supported employment tended to stay in their jobs longer than those with other types of employment support. However, we do not know whether this is because the supported employment was effective or because the people who were given supported employment were different from those who were not. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
This review was last updated in November 2018. 
Why is this important? 
People with schizophrenia often struggle to find jobs and keep them. This can make life difficult for both the person with schizophrenia and their family. Supported employability is an important approach to addressing this issue. If supported employment can help people find and retain jobs, it could improve their quality of life and reduce the need for hospital treatment. 
Key messages 
Supported employment is a promising approach to supporting people with serious mental illnesses to find employment. More research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of supported employment and to identify the factors that contribute to its success. 
Background 
Schizoprenia is one of the most disabling mental illnesses. It is characterised by hallucinations and delusions, and can cause significant impairment in social and occupational functioning. Employment is an essential component of rehabilitation for people diagnosed with schizophrenia. However the process of finding and maintaining employment is often challenging for people who have schizophrenia. 
Supported employability refers to the provision of support to individuals with schizophrenia to facilitate their employment. This support can take many forms, including vocational training, job coaching, and ongoing support in employment. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness and safety of supported employability for people aged 18 years or older with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (March 2017), CENTRAL (2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1946 to March 2016), Embase (1980 to March, 2015), PsycINFO (1887 to March. 2014), CINAHL (1982 to March, 2013), and LILACS (1981 to March. 2012). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing supported employa‐bility with other forms of vocational support for people 18 year or older diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizo‐affective disorder, or with schizophrenia spectrum disorder. We included studies that reported on the primary outcome of employment, but we excluded studies that focused on other outcomes, such a quality of work, or on the impact of supported em‐ploymen on family members. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality and certainty of the evidence. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) for dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively. We performed meta‐analyses using the fixed‐effect model. 
Main results 
We identified 7 RCTS that met the inclusion criteria. These studies had a total sample size of 1511 participants. The participants were randomly assigned to either supported employabilty or another form of vocational intervention. The supported employabiliy interventions were provided by trained staff, and the interventions were delivered in a variety of settings, including community mental health centres, hospitals, and private practices. 
The studies reported on a range of outcomes, including employment, length of employment and time to find a job, and quality of employment. We were ableto perform meta‐analisys for the following outcomes: length of any employment, time to any employment and length of paid competitive employment. The meta‐analyse of length of employed competitive employment showed a positive effect of supported employmenet (RR 3, 95% CI 1.8 to 5, low quality evideince). The meta-analysis of time to employment showed no effect of the intervention (RR1,","Supported employment for people with schizophrenia
What is the problem? 
People with schizophrenia often have difficulty finding and keeping a job. This is because they may have difficulty understanding and following instructions, may be unable to cope with stress, or may have poor communication skills. People with schizophrenia are more likely to be unemployed than those without the condition. 
What is supported employment? 
Supported employment is a type of job placement that involves helping people with mental health problems to find and keep a job in their community. It is based on the idea that people with a mental health problem can work in a job that is meaningful to them, but need help to do so. 
How does it work? 
The process of supported employability is similar to the process of finding a job for someone without a mental illness. However, the process is tailored to meet the needs of people with serious mental illness and includes several key elements. These include: 
1. A person with a serious mental health disorder is identified as being ready to start looking for a job, and is referred to a supported employment programme. 
2. An assessment is made of the individual's strengths and needs, including their ability to work, their motivation, and their ability and willingness to learn new skills. 
3. A job search plan is developed, which outlines the steps that will be taken to find a job and to maintain employment. This plan should include specific goals, strategies, and timelines. 
4. The individual is provided with ongoing support and guidance throughout the job search process. This support may include assistance with job searching, interviewing, and job placement. 
5. Once a job has been found, the individual is given ongoing support to help them maintain employment, including assistance with time management, communication skills, and problem solving. 
6. The programme is monitored and evaluated regularly, and the individual and their family are kept informed about progress. 
Key results 
Our review of 15 randomised trials involving 2266 people with psychosis found that supported employment increased the number of days spent in competitive work (job that pays money) compared to other vocational programmes (RR 3, 95 % CI 1.9 to 5.1). Supported employability also increased the length of time spent in any form paid work (MD 70 days, 43 to 97 days). 
In terms of secondary outcomes, supported employment seemed to improve the quality of work, increase the amount of time worked, and reduce the amount spent on hospital care. However the evidence was very low. 
We did not find any evidence that supported employabilty was more effective than other vocational rehabilitation programmes. 
It is unclear whether the benefits of supported empowerment are due to the specific components of the programme, or to the fact that people who are selected for the programme are already more motivated and able to engage in work. 
Future research should aim to address these questions. 
Why is this important? 
Employment is an important aspect of recovery from mental illness for many people. Employment can provide a sense of purpose, improve self‐esteem, and provide financial independence. However many people with psychotic disorders are unable to find or keep a paid job. Supported employabililty is one way to help people with this problem. 
This review provides evidence on the effectiveness and potential benefits of this approach. 
Authors' conclusions 
Supported employability seems to be an effective approach to helping people who have schizophrenia to find work. However more research is needed to understand why this is the case, and to identify the most effective ways to implement this approach in practice. 
The evidence suggests that supported emploability may be more effective for people who already have some level of education and training, and who are motivated to work. Further research is required to confirm this. 
Overall, supported employablity is a promising approach to improving employment outcomes for people diagnosed with schizophrenia. More research is necessary to fully understand its effects and to develop effective strategies for implementing it in practice.
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on supported employment for adults with schizophrenia, comparing it with other forms of vocational rehabilitation. 
Background 
People who have a diagnosis of schizophrenia are at higher risk of unemployment than people without the disorder. Employment is an essential part of recovery for many individuals with schizophrenia and is associated with improved quality of well‐being, social integration, and overall health. However people with the disorder often face barriers to employment, such as stigma, discrimination, and cognitive and emotional impairments. 
Supported Employment (SE) is a model of vocational intervention that aims to help individuals with severe and persistent mental illness to obtain and maintain competitive employment. SE is based upon the principles of the Job Development Model of Vocational Rehabilitation, which focuses on the individual’s strengths and abilities, rather than deficits. SE involves a collaborative relationship between the individual, their family, and a vocational rehabilitation specialist. The specialist helps the individual to identify and pursue employment opportunities that match their interests, skills, abilities, and preferences. 
SE is designed to be flexible and adaptable to the individual needs of each person. It may involve
Supported employment for people with schizophrenia or other severe mental illnesses
Background
Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviour. People with schizophrenia may have difficulty finding and keeping a job, and may experience social isolation and poverty. Supported employment is an approach to help people with mental illness find and keep a job. This review looked at the effectiveness of supported employment for adults with schizophrenia. 
Study characteristics
We found six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared supported employment with other approaches to help adults with severe schizophrenia find and hold a job (including job coaching, job placement, and vocational training). The trials were conducted in the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. The trials involved people with a range of symptoms, including hallucinations and delusions, and were conducted over a period of several months to two years. 
Key results
The trials showed that supported employees were more likely to find and stay in a job than those who did not receive supported employment. Supported employees were also more likely than those in other vocational groups to work in a competitive job, which means that they worked in a regular job with a fixed salary and hours. However, we could not be sure if this was due to the type of job or the fact that the person had received supported employment.
The trials also showed that people who received supported employments were more often paid than those receiving other vocational services. However we could only be certain of this for people who were working in a paid job. 
There was no difference between supported employment and other vocational programs in terms to the length of time people spent in a vocational program. 
Side effects
We could not find any information on side effects of supported employements. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the trials was generally low. This is because the trials were small, and there was a lack of detail about how the trials worked. 
What does this mean? 
The evidence from these trials suggests that people with serious mental illnesses may benefit from supported employment, but the evidence is not strong enough to say for sure. More research is needed to confirm the findings of these trials. 
This review is current to November 2010. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register, which contains references to all RCT and quasi‐RCTs identified up to November, 2011. We also searched the reference lists of articles and reviews, and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included RCT that compared the effectiveness and safety of supported employee programs with other types of vocational programs. We included studies that compared different types of supported employees programs. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data from the trials. We assessed the quality and risk of biases of the included trials. Two review authors assessed the certainty of the estimates of effect. 
Main results
We identified six RCT. The RCT were conducted by researchers in the US, Canada and Australia. The studies were conducted between 1995 and 2008. The participants were adults with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The age range was 18 to 65 years. The mean duration of the studies was 12 months. The number of participants ranged from 20 to 204. The majority of the participants were male. The average age of the study participants was 35 years. Most participants had a diagnosis that was classified as paranoid schizophrenia. The diagnosis was made using the DSM‐IV criteria. 
The studies were of varying quality. The quality of most studies was low. The main reasons for this were the lack of information about the methods used to recruit participants, the lack information about how participants were allocated to the different groups, and lack of details about the outcome measures used. 
We found that supported employee programmes were more effective than other types vocational programs for finding and holding a job for people diagnosed with schizophrenia, but we could be uncertain about this. We could not determine whether the type or length of the job was the reason for this. 
Supported employee programs were more successful than other vocational programmes in terms the length and type of employment. 
One study suggested that supported employement was associated with a lower rate of hospitalisation. 
Overall, the evidence from the included studies was of very low certainty. This means that the results of the review should be interpreted with caution. 
Future research should aim to improve the quality, and increase the number of studies included in the review. This should include studies that compare supported employment programs with different types and lengths of employment, and studies that examine the long‐term effects of these programs. It would also be helpful to conduct studies that are conducted in different countries and cultures. 
Background
People with schizophrenia often have difficulty maintaining a job and may be at risk of poverty and social isolation. Supported employee programs are designed to help individuals with schizophrenia maintain a job by providing them with support and guidance.

To assess the effectiveness, safety, and cost‐effectiveness of supported employer programs for","Supported employment for people with schizophrenia
What is the problem? 
People with schizophrenia often have difficulty finding and keeping a job. This can be due to their symptoms, lack of motivation, or difficulties with communication. People with schizophrenia are more likely to be unemployed than those without the condition. 
What does the review say? 
The review found that supported employment is effective in increasing the amount of time that people with serious mental illness spend in work. Supported employments is a type of job placement program that helps people with mental illness find and keep a job, rather than just providing them with training or education. The review looked at 14 studies involving 2266 people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. 
Key findings 
Supported employment seems more effective than other approaches in increasing employment. Supported employees seem to stay in work longer than those in other programs. Supported employers may also improve the quality of work and overall well‐being of people with the condition, although this was not clear. 
Why is this important? 
Employment is an important aspect of recovery for people suffering from schizophrenia. Employment can help reduce symptoms, improve self‐esteem and overall quality of well‐beings. It can also provide financial independence and a sense of purpose. 
How did the review do it? 
We searched for studies published up to February 2011. We included studies that compared supported employment with other types of job placements or treatment. We looked at the number of days that people spent in work, the length of time they stayed in work and the quality and stability of the work. 
Limitations 
This review only looked at studies that were conducted in the United States. It is possible that the results may differ in other countries. The studies were small and varied in terms of the way they were conducted. Some studies had poor quality evidence, which means that the findings should be interpreted with caution. 
Future research 
More research is needed to confirm these findings and to explore whether supported employment works for people who have other types or severity of mental illness. More research is also needed to understand how to make supported employment more effective. 
Authors' conclusions 
Supported employments seems to be an effective way to help people with psychosis find and stay in a job and improve their overall well-being. More studies are needed to explore how to implement supported employment in different settings and to understand its effects on people who do not have psychosis.

Background 
People who have schizophrenia often experience high levels of unemployment, which can exacerbate their symptoms and reduce their quality of lives. Supported work is a form of vocational rehabilitation designed to help individuals with schizophrenia find and retain employment. The individual placement and supports (IPS), model is one form of this approach. 
Objective 
To assess the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of supported work compared with treatment asusual or other vocational rehabilitation approaches for people diagnosed with schizophrenia. Secondary objective was to examine the impact of fidelity to IPS on the effectiveness, and the effect of adding other interventions to IPS. 
Methods 
We conducted a comprehensive search of the literature, including the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL. We also searched reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. 
We used a random‐effect meta‐analysis to combine the results of included studies. We assessed the risk of publication bias using funnel plots and Egger's test
Supported employment for people with schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses 
What is the problem? 
Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects about 1% of the population. It is characterised by hallucinations and delusions, and can cause significant problems in daily life. People with schizophrenia may have difficulty finding and keeping jobs, and may experience social isolation and poverty. Supported employment is an approach to helping people with mental illness find and keep work. This approach involves providing support and training to help people with the skills they need to find and maintain employment. 
What did we do? 
We searched for all relevant studies on supported employment for adults with schizophrenia or other severe and persistent mental illnesses. We included studies that compared supported employment with other types of vocational interventions, such as job coaching or vocational rehabilitation. We also included studies where supported employment was compared with no intervention. 
We found 15 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in different countries and involved people with a range of mental health conditions. The studies were small, and most of them had a short duration. The quality of the evidence was generally low. 
Key results 
Supported employment may improve a number or type of vocational outcome, such that people with serious mental illnesses are more likely to find a job and stay in that job. However, the quality and quantity of evidence were very low. There was little evidence about the long‐term effects of supported employment. One study suggested that supported employees may take longer to find employment than those who received other types or amounts of vocational support. 
Overall, the evidence suggests supported employment may be effective in increasing the number of people with psychiatric disorders who are employed, but the quality or quantity of the available evidence was very low, and further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Quality of the current evidence 
The quality of this evidence is very low because the studies were few, small, or had a very short duration, and were conducted over a period of time. Most of the studies had a high risk of reporting bias, and there was a lack of information about the participants. 
Future research should aim to conduct larger, well‐designed studies with a longer duration, that provide more information about participants, and that include a wider range of outcomes. 
Background 
Schizoprenia is an important mental illness with a significant impact on the quality‐of‐life of people affected by it. People diagnosed with schizopernia often experience difficulties in finding and maintaining employment. Employment is an essential component of rehabilitation and recovery from mental illness. Employment can improve physical health, reduce social isolation, and enhance self‐esteem. 
Supported employability is an intervention that aims to help individuals with mental illnesses find and retain employment. Supported employability involves providing training and support to help participants develop the skills and confidence they need for employment. This can include job coaching, vocational training, and assistance with finding employment. The goal of supported employability interventions is to help the participant find a paid job and to maintain that job over time. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness of supported employmennt for people diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, or other mental illnesses, in terms to their ability to find paid employment and to remain in paid employment. We wanted to know whether supported employemnent was more effective than other types and amounts of employment support. We were interested in the duration of employment, the type of employment (e.g. part‐time or full‐time), and the level of job satisfaction. 
Search methods 
We conducted a comprehensive search of the literature up to August 2010. We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Specialised Register, the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Social Science Citation Index. We contacted experts in the field and searched reference lists of relevant articles.
