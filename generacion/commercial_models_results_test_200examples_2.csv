"Background
This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2005, Issue 4 (and last updated in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2013 issue 8), on local anaesthetic blockade (LASB) of the sympathetic chain to treat people with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy of LASB for the treatment of pain in CRPS and to evaluate the incidence of adverse effects of the procedure. 
Search methods
For this update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), LILACS (Birme), conference abstracts of the World Congresses of the International Association for the Study of Pain, and various clinical trial registers up to September 2015. We also searched bibliographies from retrieved articles for additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of sympathetic blockade with local anaesthetics in children or adults with CRPS compared to placebo, no treatment, or alternative treatments. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The outcomes of interest were reduction in pain intensity, the proportion who achieved moderate or substantial pain relief, the duration of pain relief, and the presence of adverse effects in each treatment arm. We assessed the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and created a 'Summary of findings' table. 
Main results
We included an additional four studies (N = 154) in this update. For this update, we excluded studies that did not follow up patients for more than 48 hours. As a result, we excluded four studies from the previous review in this update. Overall we included 12 studies (N = 461), all of which we judged to be at high or unclear risk of bias. Overall, the quality of evidence was low to very low, downgraded due to limitations, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, or a combination of these. 
Two small studies compared LASB to placebo/sham (N = 32). They did not demonstrate significant short‐term benefit for LASB for pain intensity (moderate quality evidence). 
One small study (N = 36) at high risk of bias compared thoracic sympathetic block with corticosteroid and local anaesthetic versus injection of the same agents into the subcutaneous space, reporting statistically significant and clinically important differences in pain intensity at one‐year follow‐up but not at short term follow‐up (very low quality evidence). 
Of two studies that investigated LASB as an addition to rehabilitation treatment, the only study that reported pain outcomes demonstrated no additional benefit from LASB (very low quality evidence). 
Eight small randomised studies compared sympathetic blockade to various other active interventions. Most studies found no difference in pain outcomes between sympathetic block versus other active treatments (low to very low quality evidence). 
One small study compared ultrasound‐guided LASB with non‐guided LASB and found no clinically important difference in pain outcomes (very low quality evidence). 
Six studies reported adverse events, all with minor effects reported.
Authors' conclusions
This update's results are similar to the previous versions of this systematic review, and the main conclusions are unchanged. There remains a scarcity of published evidence and a lack of high quality evidence to support or refute the use of local anaesthetic sympathetic blockade for CRPS. From the existing evidence, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding the efficacy or safety of this intervention, but the limited data available do not suggest that LASB is effective for reducing pain in CRPS.","Local anaesthetic sympathetic blockade for complex regional pain syndrome
Background 
Local anaesthetic sympathetic blockade (LASB) is a common treatment for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). It involves blocking the activity of sympathetic nerves alongside the spine. The sympathetic nervous system mainly controls unconscious actions such as heart rate, blood flow, and perspiration. The injection of a local anaesthetic drug around the nerves temporarily blocks the function of the nerves. This updated review aimed to summarise the available evidence regarding whether LASB is effective at reducing pain in CRPS, how long any pain relief might last, and whether LASB is safe. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
In September 2015, we found a limited number of small trials, all of which had design flaws. We did not find evidence that LASB was better than placebo in reducing pain, or that it provided additional pain relief when added to rehabilitation. While a number of small studies compared LASB to other treatments, most did not find that LASB was better. One small study found that injecting the thoracic (upper back) sympathetic nerves with local anaesthetic and steroid was better than injecting the same drugs just under the skin at one‐year follow‐up, but the study may have been prone to bias. Only six studies reported on the type and amount of side effects. These studies reported only minor side effects, but since some studies did not report this information we can draw no firm conclusions about the safety of LASB. The evidence was mostly of low or very low quality. 
Overall, the evidence is limited, conflicting, and of low quality. While we cannot draw strong conclusions, the existing evidence is not encouraging.","# Plain Language Summary: Local Anesthetic Nerve Blocks for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome

## What is this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies on a medical procedure called a local anesthetic sympathetic blockade (LASB). This procedure uses numbing medicine to block certain nerves in the body. Doctors use it to try to help people with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)—a condition that causes long-lasting pain, usually in an arm or leg.

## What did researchers want to find out?

The researchers wanted to know:
- Does this nerve-blocking procedure help reduce pain in people with CRPS?
- What side effects does the procedure cause?

## How did they do this?

Researchers looked at 12 studies that tested this procedure. These studies included 461 people total. They compared the nerve-blocking procedure to:
- Fake procedures (placebo)
- No treatment
- Other treatments

## What did they find?

**Main findings:**
- Studies comparing the nerve block to fake procedures showed **no clear benefit** for pain relief
- When compared to other treatments, the nerve block **did not work better** than the alternatives
- The few side effects reported were **minor**
- The overall quality of evidence was **low**—meaning we can't be very confident in the results

## Bottom line

There is **not enough good evidence** to say whether this nerve-blocking procedure works for CRPS pain. The studies done so far suggest it may **not be effective**, but researchers need better studies to be sure.","### Plain Language Summary

#### Purpose of the Review
This review looked at whether a treatment called local anesthetic sympathetic blockade (LASB) helps people with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). It also checked if the treatment causes any side effects.

#### What They Did
Researchers searched through medical databases and past studies until September 2015. They focused on studies where people with CRPS were treated with LASB and compared it to other treatments, like no treatment or alternative therapies. They wanted to see if LASB decreased pain and if it had any side effects.

#### Who Was Studied
The review included 12 studies with a total of 461 participants. Some studies involved children, and others involved adults with CRPS.

#### Key Findings
- Two small studies (32 people) showed that LASB didn’t have a major short-term effect on pain.
- One small study (36 people) showed some improvement at a one-year follow-up, but not right after the treatment.
- Adding LASB to physical rehabilitation didn’t seem to help with pain.
- Eight studies compared LASB to other treatments and found no differences in pain relief.
- One study found no difference between ultrasound-guided LASB and non-guided LASB.
- Six studies reported only minor side effects.

#### Conclusion
The results were similar to past studies. There isn't enough high-quality evidence to say if LASB works well or not for CRPS. Right now, LASB doesn’t seem to effectively reduce pain in CRPS, based on the limited data available."
"Background
This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in September 2014. The most common primary brain tumours in adults are gliomas. Gliomas span a spectrum from low to high grade and are graded pathologically on a scale of one to four according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. High‐grade glioma (HGG) carries a poor prognosis. Grade IV glioma is known as glioblastoma and carries a median survival in treated patients of about 15 months. Glioblastomas are rich in blood vessels (i.e. highly vascular) and also rich in a protein known as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that promotes new blood vessel formation (the process of angiogenesis). Anti‐angiogenic agents inhibit the process of new blood vessel formation and promote regression of existing vessels. Several anti‐angiogenic agents have been investigated in clinical trials, both in newly diagnosed and recurrent HGG, showing preliminary promising results. This review was undertaken to report on the benefits and harms associated with the use of anti‐angiogenic agents in the treatment of HGGs. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of anti‐angiogenic therapy in people with high‐grade glioma (HGG). The intervention can be used in two broad groups: at first diagnosis as part of 'adjuvant' therapy, or in the setting of recurrent disease. 
Search methods
We conducted updated searches to identify published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 9), MEDLINE and Embase to October 2018. We handsearched proceedings of relevant oncology conferences up to 2018. We also searched trial registries for ongoing studies. 
Selection criteria
RCTs evaluating the use of anti‐angiogenic therapy to treat HGG versus the same therapy without anti‐angiogenic therapy. 
Data collection and analysis
Review authors screened the search results and reviewed the abstracts of potentially relevant articles before retrieving the full text of eligible articles. 
Main results
After a comprehensive literature search, we identified 11 eligible RCTs (3743 participants), of which 7 were included in the original review (2987 participants). There was significant design heterogeneity in the included studies, especially in the response assessment criteria used. All eligible studies were restricted to glioblastomas and there were no eligible studies evaluating other HGGs. Ten studies were available as fully published peer‐reviewed manuscripts, and one study was available in abstract form. The overall risk of bias in included studies was low. This risk was based upon low rates of selection bias, detection bias, attrition bias and reporting bias. The 11 studies included in this review did not show an improvement in overall survival with the addition of anti‐angiogenic therapy (pooled hazard ratio (HR) of 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.02; P = 0.16; 11 studies, 3743 participants; high‐certainty evidence). However, pooled analysis from 10 studies (3595 participants) showed improvement in progression‐free survival with the addition of anti‐angiogenic therapy (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.79; P < 0.00001; high‐certainty evidence). 
We carried out additional analyses of overall survival and progression‐free survival according to treatment setting and for anti‐angiogenic therapy combined with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone. Pooled analysis of overall survival in either the adjuvant or recurrent setting did not show an improvement (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.02; P = 0.12; 8 studies, 2833 participants; high‐certainty evidence and HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; P = 0.90; 3 studies, 910 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence, respectively). Pooled analysis of overall survival for anti‐angiogenic therapy combined with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy also did not clearly show an improvement (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.00; P = 0.05; 11 studies, 3506 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The progression‐free survival in the subgroups all showed findings that demonstrated improvements in progression‐free survival with the addition of anti‐angiogenic therapy. Pooled analysis of progression‐free survival in both the adjuvant and recurrent setting showed an improvement (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.82; P < 0.00001; 8 studies, 2833 participants; high‐certainty evidence and HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.76; P < 0.00001; 2 studies, 762 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence, respectively). Pooled analysis of progression‐free survival for anti‐angiogenic therapy combined with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone showed an improvement (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.77; P < 0.00001; 10 studies, 3464 participants). Similar to trials of anti‐angiogenic therapies in other solid tumours, adverse events related to this class of therapy included hypertension and proteinuria, poor wound healing, and the potential for thromboembolic events, although generally, the rate of grade 3 and 4 adverse events was low (< 14.1%) and in keeping with the literature. The impact of anti‐angiogenic therapy on quality of life varied between studies. 
Authors' conclusions
The use of anti‐angiogenic therapy does not significantly improve overall survival in newly diagnosed people with glioblastoma. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of anti‐angiogenic therapy for people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma at this time. Overall there is a lack of evidence of a survival advantage for anti‐angiogenic therapy over chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma. When considering the combination anti‐angiogenic therapy with chemotherapy compared with the same chemotherapy alone, there may possibly be a small improvement in overall survival. While there is strong evidence that bevacizumab (an anti‐angiogenic drug) prolongs progression‐free survival in newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma, the impact of this on quality of life and net clinical benefit for patients remains unclear. Not addressed here is whether subsets of people with glioblastoma may benefit from anti‐angiogenic therapies, nor their utility in other HGG histologies.","Drugs that target blood vessels in malignant brain tumours
Background The commonest primary brain tumours of adults are gliomas which comprise about two‐fifths of all primary brain tumours. Gliomas span a spectrum from low to high grade, and are graded pathologically on a scale of one to four, according to a classification by the World Health Organization (WHO) that was last updated in 2016. High‐grade glioma, including glioblastoma, are difficult to treat and carry a poor prognosis. 
These tumours produce a protein that promotes the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) to help them grow. Drugs have been developed to reduce the formation of new blood vessels and slow tumour growth. Bevacizumab, cediranib and cilengitide are anti‐angiogenic drugs that directly or indirectly target blood vessel formation and have been studied in glioblastoma in randomised clinical trials.  
Study characteristics After a comprehensive search up to October 2018, we identified 11 eligible randomised clinical trials (totaling 3743 participants). All eligible studies were restricted to glioblastomas; there were no eligible studies that included other brain tumour types. The largest trials were conducted in newly diagnosed people with glioblastoma, treated with anti‐angiogenic therapy. Overall, the trials included in this systematic review did not show improvement in overall survival with the use of anti‐angiogenic therapy. Overall, the clinical trials in bevacizumab‐treated glioblastoma did prolong the time until tumour growth (progression‐free survival).  Key results Anti‐angiogenic therapy does not significantly prolong life in newly diagnosed people with glioblastoma. In recurrent glioblastoma although there is no evidence of prolonging life over chemotherapy, when anti‐angiogenic therapies are used in combination with certain chemotherapy regimes there may be a small improvement in survival. Anti‐angiogenic agents delay tumour progression on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans but is commonly associated with side effects, such as high blood pressure and protein in the urine.","# Plain Language Summary: Anti-Angiogenic Therapy for High-Grade Brain Tumors

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether a type of medicine called anti-angiogenic therapy helps people with a serious brain tumor called glioblastoma. Researchers searched for and studied 11 different clinical trials involving 3,743 people total.

## Background: What is glioblastoma?

Glioblastoma is the most serious type of brain tumor. These tumors have lots of blood vessels and produce a protein that helps new blood vessels grow. Anti-angiogenic medicines try to stop new blood vessels from forming and shrink existing ones. The idea is that without blood vessels, the tumor can't grow as well.

## What did researchers find?

**The main finding:** Anti-angiogenic therapy did **not** help people live longer overall.

**However:** The medicine **did** slow down tumor growth for a while. This means tumors took longer to get worse, but patients didn't live longer in the end.

**Side effects:** The medicine caused some problems like high blood pressure, protein in urine, and slow wound healing. But serious side effects were uncommon (less than 14%).

## What does this mean?

Right now, there isn't enough proof that this type of medicine helps people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma live longer. Doctors need more research to understand if it helps certain patients or if combining it with other treatments works better.","**Understanding the Study on Brain Tumor Treatment**

**Background:**  
This study focuses on high-grade gliomas, a type of brain tumor in adults. These tumors are serious, especially a type called glioblastoma, where people usually live about 15 months after treatment. Glioblastomas have lots of blood vessels, helped by a protein called VEGF. Scientists are testing drugs that stop new blood vessels from forming to see if they help treat these tumors.

**Objective:**  
The goal is to find out if these anti-angiogenic drugs work well and are safe for people with high-grade gliomas. These drugs can be used right after diagnosis or if the tumor comes back.

**How the Study Was Done:**  
Researchers looked for studies on this topic in medical databases and conference reports up to 2018. They reviewed all the found studies to see if the drugs were tested fairly.

**Key Findings:**  
- **Participants:** 11 studies with 3743 people were looked at.
- **Survival Results:** The studies showed that adding these drugs did not significantly help people live longer overall.
- **Tumor Growth:** The drugs did help delay tumor growth in many cases.
- **Safety:** The drugs had side effects like high blood pressure and poor wound healing, but these were not very common.

**Conclusion:**  
The drugs do not significantly help people live longer, but they might help keep the tumor from growing for a while. It's unclear how much this helps with everyday life. More research is needed to see if they help certain groups of people and other types of tumors."
"Background
Implant overdentures are one of the most common treatment options used to rehabilitate edentulous patients. Attachment systems are used to anchor the overdentures to implants. The plethora of attachment systems available dictates a need for clinicians to understand their prosthodontic and patient‐related outcomes. 
Objectives
To compare different attachment systems for maxillary and mandibular implant overdentures by assessing prosthodontic success, prosthodontic maintenance, patient preference, patient satisfaction/quality of life and costs. 
Search methods
Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 24 January 2018); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 12) in the Cochrane Library (searched 24 January 2018); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 24 January 2018); and Embase Ovid (1980 to 24 January 2018). The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials on 24 January 2018. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over trials on maxillary or mandibular implant overdentures with different attachment systems with at least 1 year follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
Four review authors extracted data independently and assessed risk of bias for each included trial. Several corresponding authors were subsequently contacted to obtain missing information. Fixed‐effect meta‐analysis was used to combine the outcomes with risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence and create 'Summary of findings' tables. 
Main results
We identified six RCTs with a total of 294 mandibular overdentures (including one cross‐over trial). No trials on maxillary overdentures were eligible. Due to the poor reporting of the outcomes across the included trials, only limited analyses between mandibular overdenture attachment systems were possible. 
Comparing ball and bar attachments, upon pooling the data regarding short‐term prosthodontic success, we identified substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 97%) with inconsistency in the direction of effect, which was unexplained by clinical or methodological differences between the studies, and accordingly we did not perform meta‐analyses for this outcome. Short‐term re‐treatment (repair of attachment system) was higher with ball attachments (RR 3.11, 95% CI 1.68 to 5.75; 130 participants; 2 studies; very low‐quality evidence), and there was no difference between both attachment systems in short‐term re‐treatment (replacement of attachment system) (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.71; 130 participants; 2 studies; very low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in short‐term prosthodontic success when ball attachments are compared with bar attachments. 
Comparing ball and magnet attachments, there was no difference between them in medium‐term prosthodontic success (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.10; 69 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), or in medium‐term re‐treatment (repair of attachment system) (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 4.72; 69 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence). However, after 5 years, prosthodontic maintenance costs were higher when magnet attachments were used (MD ‐247.37 EUR, 95% CI ‐346.32 to ‐148.42; 69 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in medium‐term prosthodontic success when ball attachments are compared with magnet attachments. 
One trial provided data for ball versus telescopic attachments and reported no difference in prosthodontic maintenance between the two systems in short‐term patrix replacement (RR 6.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 41.96; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), matrix activation (RR 11.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 177.72; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), matrix replacement (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.71 to 4.31; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), or in relining of the implant overdenture (RR 2.33, 95% CI 0.81 to 6.76; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in short‐term prosthodontic maintenance when ball attachments are compared with telescopic attachments. 
In the only cross‐over trial included, patient preference between different attachment systems was assessed after only 3 months and not for the entire trial period of 10 years. 
Authors' conclusions
For mandibular overdentures, there is insufficient evidence to determine the relative effectiveness of different attachment systems on prosthodontic success, prosthodontic maintenance, patient satisfaction, patient preference or costs. In the short term, there is some evidence that is insufficient to show a difference and where there was no evidence was reported. It was not possible to determine any preferred attachment system for mandibular overdentures. 
For maxillary overdentures, there is no evidence (with no trials identified) to determine the relative effectiveness of different attachment systems on prosthodontic success, prosthodontic maintenance, patient satisfaction, patient preference or costs. 
Further RCTs on edentulous cohorts must pay attention to trial design specifically using the same number of implants of the same implant system, but with different attachment systems clearly identified in control and test groups. Trials should also determine the longevity of different attachment systems and patient preferences. Trials on the current array of computer‐aided designed/computer‐assisted manufactured (CAD/CAM) bar attachment systems are encouraged.","Attachments for implant dentures
Review question 
The aim of this review was to assess different attachments used for upper or lower jaw implant dentures with respect to their success, wear and tear, patient satisfaction, patient preference and cost. 
Background 
For adults with complete tooth loss, the modern approach is implant dentures with attachment systems connecting the implants to the undersurface of the dentures. It is important to do the review as the choice of the number of implants and the design of the attachments influences prosthesis success, the amount of wear and tear, patient satisfaction, preference and costs. 
Study characteristics 
Authors from Cochrane Oral Health carried out this review and the evidence is up to date to 24 January 2018. A total of six trials on adults with complete tooth loss were included with a total of 294 lower jaw dentures (anchored by one or more implants). The review looked at different attachment systems on the same implant systems. The six trials did not each evaluate the same attachment systems. There were no eligible trials with upper jaw implant dentures. 
Key results 
There is insufficient evidence to determine any significant differences between lower jaw implant denture attachment systems and an absence of evidence for upper jaw implant denture attachment systems. Further randomised controlled trials on people with complete tooth loss wearing dentures must pay specific attention to trial design using the same implant system and the same number of implants, but different attachment systems to determine their longevity and patient preferences. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low. In all the included trials there were relatively few participants and few events, and there were serious limitations in the trial designs with data missing or not all outcomes reported.","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Different Attachment Systems for Implant-Supported Dentures

## What is this study about?

This review looked at research comparing different ways to attach dentures to dental implants. When people lose all their teeth, implant-supported dentures (false teeth held in place by implants) are a common treatment. Different attachment systems (like clips or magnets) can hold these dentures in place. The researchers wanted to find out which attachment system works best.

## Who was studied?

The review included six research studies with a total of 294 people who received lower jaw implant dentures. No studies looked at upper jaw dentures, so the researchers couldn't compare those.

## What was being tested?

Researchers compared different attachment systems, including:
- Ball attachments (small round connectors)
- Bar attachments (bar-shaped connectors)
- Magnet attachments
- Telescopic attachments (sliding connectors)

They looked at how well the attachments worked, how often they needed repairs, how satisfied patients were, and the costs.

## What did they find?

The researchers found that:
- Ball attachments needed more repairs than bar attachments in the short term
- There was no clear difference between ball and magnet attachments
- Magnet attachments cost more to maintain over 5 years
- There wasn't enough information to compare ball and telescopic attachments
- Patient preferences were only measured for 3 months in one study, not over the full study period

## Main conclusion

There is **not enough evidence** to say which attachment system is best. The researchers said more and better-designed studies are needed to answer this question.","### Study Summary: Comparing Implant Overdenture Attachment Systems

**Purpose of the Study:**
The study compared different systems used to attach dentures to implants in people without teeth to see which works best in different areas: success of the dentures, upkeep needed, how much people like them, their satisfaction, and costs.

**Who Was Studied:**
The study focused on people using dentures attached to implants in the lower jaw. No studies for upper jaw dentures met the criteria.

**What Was Done:**
Researchers looked at existing studies where dentures were attached using different methods. They wanted to see how well these methods worked over at least one year.

**What They Found:**
- There were six studies on lower jaw dentures, involving 294 people.
- Some studies showed more repairs were needed for ball attachments compared to bar attachments, but not enough information was found to say one type is better.
- There was no clear difference in success between ball and magnet attachments or between ball and telescopic attachments.
- After five years, dentures with magnets cost more to maintain than those with ball attachments.
- There was not enough information to decide which attachment people preferred.

**Conclusion:**
- For lower jaw dentures, there's not enough evidence to say which attachment system is the best overall.
- For upper jaw dentures, no studies met the criteria, so no conclusions can be made.

**Recommendations:**
- Future studies should use a consistent approach and include detailed comparison of different attachment systems.
- New studies should also explore advanced technology in making these attachments.

This study helps dentists and patients understand more about different ways to attach dentures to implants, but more research is needed for clear answers, especially for upper jaw dentures."
"Background
Pit and fissure sealants are plastic materials that are used to seal deep pits and fissures on the occlusal surfaces of teeth, where decay occurs most often in children and adolescents. Deep pits and fissures can retain food debris and bacteria, making them difficult to clean, thereby causing them to be more susceptible to dental caries. The application of a pit and fissure sealant, a non‐invasive preventive approach, can prevent dental caries by forming a protective barrier that reduces food entrapment and bacterial growth. Though moderate‐certainty evidence shows that sealants are effective in preventing caries in permanent teeth, the effectiveness of applying pit and fissure sealants to primary teeth has yet to be established. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of sealants compared to no sealant or a different sealant in preventing pit and fissure caries on the occlusal surfaces of primary molars in children and to report the adverse effects and the retention of different types of sealants. 
Search methods
An information specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 11 February 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies. Review authors scanned the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews for further studies. 
Selection criteria
We included parallel‐group and split‐mouth randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a sealant with no sealant, or different types of sealants, for the prevention of caries in primary molars, with no restriction on follow‐up duration. We included studies in which co‐interventions such as oral health preventive measures, oral health education or tooth brushing demonstrations were used, provided that the same adjunct was used with the intervention and comparator. We excluded studies with complex interventions for the prevention of dental caries in primary teeth such as preventive resin restorations, or studies that used sealants in cavitated carious lesions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. We presented outcomes for the development of new carious lesions on occlusal surfaces of primary molars as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where studies were similar in clinical and methodological characteristics, we planned to pool effect estimates using a random‐effects model where appropriate. We used GRADE methodology to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included nine studies that randomised 1120 children who ranged in age from 18 months to eight years at the start of the study. One study compared fluoride‐releasing resin‐based sealant with no sealant (139 tooth pairs in 90 children); two studies compared glass ionomer‐based sealant with no sealant (619 children); two studies compared glass ionomer‐based sealant with resin‐based sealant (278 tooth pairs in 200 children); two studies compared fluoride‐releasing resin‐based sealant with resin‐based sealant (113 tooth pairs in 69 children); one study compared composite with fluoride‐releasing resin‐based sealant (40 tooth pairs in 40 children); and one study compared autopolymerised sealant with light polymerised sealant (52 tooth pairs in 52 children). 
Three studies evaluated the effects of sealants versus no sealant and provided data for our primary outcome. Due to differences in study design such as age of participants and duration of follow‐up, we elected not to pool the data. At 24 months, there was insufficient evidence of a difference in the development of new caries lesions for the fluoride‐releasing sealants or no treatment groups (Becker Balagtas odds ratio (BB OR) 0.76, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.42; 1 study, 85 children, 255 tooth surfaces). For glass ionomer‐based sealants, the evidence was equivocal; one study found insufficient evidence of a difference at follow‐up between 12 and 30 months (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.49; 449 children), while another with 12‐month follow‐up found a large, beneficial effect of sealants (OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.15; 107 children). We judged the certainty of the evidence to be low, downgrading two levels in total for study limitations, imprecision and inconsistency. 
We included six trials randomising 411 children that directly compared different sealant materials, four of which (221 children) provided data for our primary outcome. Differences in age of the participants and duration of follow‐up precluded pooling of the data. The incidence of development of new caries lesions was typically low across the different sealant types evaluated. We judged the certainty of the evidence to be low or very low for the outcome of caries incidence. 
Only one study assessed and reported adverse events, the nature of which was gag reflex while placing the sealant material. 
Authors' conclusions
The certainty of the evidence for the comparisons and outcomes in this review was low or very low, reflecting the fragility and uncertainty of the evidence base. The volume of evidence for this review was limited, which typically included small studies where the number of events was low. The majority of studies in this review were of split‐mouth design, an efficient study design for this research question; however, there were often shortcomings in the analysis and reporting of results that made synthesising the evidence difficult. An important omission from the included studies was the reporting of adverse events. Given the importance of prevention for maintaining good oral health, there exists an important evidence gap pertaining to the caries‐preventive effect and retention of sealants in the primary dentition, which should be addressed through robust RCTs.","Sealants for preventing tooth decay in baby teeth
Review question 
Can putting sealants over the biting surfaces of baby teeth in the back of the mouth prevent tooth decay forming in them? 
Background 
Tooth decay is one of the most common diseases of childhood that can affect the overall well‐being of the child. The most commonly affected teeth are the back teeth whose biting surfaces are not flat and have grooves (pits and fissures) that can retain food debris and bacteria, leading to formation of cavities (decay). In addition, the opening of these grooves is so small that a toothbrush bristle cannot enter them completely, making them difficult to clean. Sealing the grooves is one of the ways to prevent decay in back teeth. Sealant acts as a protective barrier to food and bacteria, thus preventing their harmful action on tooth surfaces. 
Study characteristics 
We included nine studies that involved 1120 children (aged 18 months to eight years). The studies used a variety of dental sealants to prevent tooth decay in baby teeth. We assessed most studies as being at high risk of bias overall, because the dental professionals who were measuring the outcomes could see whether a sealant had been placed, and also differentiated between sealant materials. 
Key results 
Three studies compared sealants with no sealants, and six studies compared different materials or processes to seal the tooth surface. As there were important differences in the design of the studies in terms of the sealant types, the age of the children at the start of the trial and the length of follow‐up, we were unable to pool the data. Only one trial assessed and reported side effects, the nature of which was gag reflex while placing the sealant material. 
Quality of evidence 
We found low‐quality evidence regarding the effectiveness of sealants in preventing tooth decay on biting surfaces of back baby teeth in children. Hence, we are unable to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of sealants compared to no sealant or a different sealant in preventing development of decay on baby teeth in children. More well‐conducted studies with long follow‐up times are needed. 
How up‐to‐date is the evidence? 
The review includes studies available from a search of the literature up to 11 February 2021.","# Plain Language Summary: Dental Sealants for Baby Teeth

## What is this study about?

This study looked at whether plastic coatings called ""sealants"" can prevent cavities on baby molars (back teeth). Sealants are painted onto teeth to fill deep grooves where food and germs can get stuck and cause decay.

## Why does this matter?

Baby molars have deep pits and grooves that are hard to clean with a toothbrush. Food and bacteria can hide in these spots and cause cavities. Sealants create a protective barrier to stop this from happening. Scientists know sealants work well on adult teeth, but they weren't sure if they work on baby teeth.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for studies comparing:
- Sealants versus no sealant
- Different types of sealants (like glass-based or resin-based)

They looked at 9 studies involving 1,120 children ages 18 months to 8 years old.

## What did they find?

**Sealants vs. no sealant:**
- Results were mixed and unclear
- One type of sealant showed some benefit, but another type showed mixed results
- The evidence wasn't strong enough to say for sure if sealants prevent cavities on baby teeth

**Different sealant types:**
- When comparing different sealant types to each other, cavities were rare in all groups
- No clear winner among the different types

**Side effects:**
- Only one study reported side effects (gagging when the sealant was applied)
- Most studies didn't report on safety

## Bottom line

The evidence is weak and unclear. More and better research is needed to know if sealants really prevent cavities on baby teeth and how long they stay in place.","### Simple Summary for the General Public

**What is the study about?**

This study looks at how well special plastic coatings, called sealants, work to stop cavities in young kids' back teeth. These sealants block food and germs from getting stuck in hard-to-clean spots on the teeth.

**Who participated in the study?**

The study included 1,120 children, aged 18 months to 8 years.

**What did the researchers do?**

They compared different kinds of sealants to see how well they work. Some kids got sealants, while others did not. They looked at the kids' teeth over time to see if they developed fewer cavities.

**Main Findings:**

1. **Sealants vs. No Sealants:**
   - Some studies found that sealants might help reduce cavities, but the evidence was not strong.
   - The results were mixed, meaning not all studies agreed.

2. **Different Types of Sealants:**
   - The study compared various sealant types, like resin-based and glass ionomer sealants.
   - The number of new cavities was low, but the certainty about which sealant works best was also low.

3. **Safety:**
   - Only one study mentioned any problems, like kids feeling like they might gag when the sealant was put on.

**Conclusions:**

The evidence isn't strong enough to clearly tell us which sealants are best for young children's teeth or if they are better than not using sealants at all. More research is needed to find out how well sealants work in preventing cavities for young kids."
"Background
This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review first published in 2008. Scoliosis surgery is often associated with substantial blood loss and potentially detrimental effects in children. Antifibrinolytic agents are often used to reduce perioperative blood loss. Clinical trials have evaluated their efficacy in children undergoing surgical correction of scoliosis, but no systematic review has been published. This review was first published in 2008 and was updated in 2016. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of aprotinin, tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid in reducing blood loss and transfusion requirements in children undergoing surgery for correction of idiopathic or secondary scoliosis. 
Search methods
We ran the search for the previous review in June 2007. For this updated version, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to August week 1 2015), Embase (1947 to 2015 week 38), Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1982 to 14 August 2015), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE; 2015, Issue 2) and reference lists of reviews and retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials in any language. We also checked the clinical trial registry at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov on 8 October 2015. 
Selection criteria
We included blinded and unblinded randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of antifibrinolytics on perioperative blood loss in children 18 years of age or younger and undergoing scoliosis surgery. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data. The primary outcome was total blood loss (intraoperative and postoperative combined). Secondary efficacy outcomes were the number of participants receiving blood transfusion (both autologous and allogeneic) or receiving allogeneic blood transfusion alone, and the total amount of blood transfused. Safety outcomes included the number of deaths, the number of participants reporting any adverse event or a serious adverse event, withdrawals due to adverse events and the number of participants experiencing a specific adverse event (i.e. renal insufficiency, hypersensitivity or thrombosis). We assessed methodological risk of bias for each included study and employed the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We included three new studies (201 participants) in this updated review, for a total of nine studies (455 participants). All but one study employed placebo as the control group intervention. For the primary outcome, antifibrinolytic drugs decreased the amount of perioperative blood loss by 427 mL (95% confidence interval (CI) 251 to 603 mL), for a reduction of over 20% versus placebo. We rated the quality of evidence for our primary outcome as low on the basis of unclear risk of bias for several domains in most studies and the small total number of participants. 
For secondary outcomes, fewer participants receiving antifibrinolytic drugs received transfusion (allogeneic or autologous) versus those receiving placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.85, number needed to treat to prevent one additional harmful outcome (NNTp) 5; very low‐quality evidence). Only two studies specifically evaluated the number of participants transfused with only allogeneic blood (risk difference (RD) ‐0.15, 95% CI ‐0.26 to ‐0.03, NNTp 7; very low‐quality evidence). Antifibrinolytic drugs decreased the volume of blood transfused by 327 mL (95% CI ‐186 to ‐469 mL; low‐quality evidence). 
No study reported deaths in active or control groups. Data were insufficient to allow performance of meta‐analysis for any safety outcome. No studies adequately described their methods in assessing safety. The only adverse event of note occurred in one study, when three participants in the placebo group developed postoperative deep vein thrombosis. 
Authors' conclusions
Since the last published version of this review (2008), we have found three new studies. Additional evidence shows that antifibrinolytics reduce the requirement for both autologous and allogeneic blood transfusion. Limited evidence of low to very low quality supports the use of antifibrinolytic drugs for reducing blood loss and decreasing the risk, and volume, of transfusion in children undergoing scoliosis surgery. Evidence is insufficient to support the use of a particular agent, although tranexamic acid may be preferred, given its widespread availability. The optimal dose regimen for any of these three agents has not been established. Although adverse events appear to occur infrequently, evidence is insufficient to confirm the safety of these agents, particularly for rare but potentially catastrophic events. No long‐term safety data are available.","Antifibrinolytic agents to reduce blood loss in the surgical correction of scoliosis (abnormal curvatures of the spine) in children 
Background 
Scoliosis is a curving of the spine beyond that which is normal. Surgery may be needed to correct scoliosis and is often carried out when the child is young. Substantial bleeding may occur during surgery and can lead to serious complications, such as multiple organ failure. Many methods are used to reduce blood loss, including drugs that modify clotting pathways in the body. Medications known as antifibrinolytic drugs can reduce bleeding by preventing the breakdown of a blood clot. This review is an update of a review published in 2008, which looked at how well these drugs work, and how safe they are. 
Search date 
This review is an update of a review that we first published in 2008. Our latest search for articles took place in August 2015. 
Study characteristics 
The antifibrinolytic drugs evaluated in this systematic review were aprotinin, tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid. We found nine studies that enrolled a total of 455 participants, aged 18 years or younger, who received either antifibrinolytic drugs or a placebo. 
Total enrolment in each study ranged from 36 participants to 80 participants. Two of the studies evaluated aprotinin, four tranexamic acid and four aminocaproic acid. One study compared aminocaproic acid with tranexamic acid. The other studies administered placebo to the control group. Studies that evaluated aprotinin and aminocaproic acid used high doses (when reported). Of the studies that evaluated tranexamic acid, two used high doses, one used low doses and one did not describe the dose given. Five studies evaluated idiopathic scoliosis (scoliosis with no known cause), and four evaluated both idiopathic scoliosis and scoliosis that occurred as the result of another disease, such as cerebral palsy. 
Of the nine included studies, five reported how long patients were assessed. Follow‐up ranged from one to 10 days after surgery, or lasted for the participant's length of stay in the hospital. 
Study funding sources 
Two studies received grants from organizations of healthcare professionals, and one was sponsored by a pharmaceutical company. The remaining studies did not report sources of funding. 
Key results 
Antifibrinolytic drugs reduced the amount of blood lost during, or immediately after, surgery, by 427 millilitres (mL) (more than a 20% reduction in blood loss) and the amount of blood transfused during the same period by 327 mL. The number of children who received transfusions, either through blood from a donor or through a combination of blood from a donor and their own saved blood, was also significantly decreased. We assessed the quality of the evidence for all of these findings as low or very low because of the small numbers of participants, some concerns about study designs and imprecision in study findings. 
No children included in any studies died, and very few adverse events were reported, although three children receiving placebo in one study developed a clot. However, these studies may not have adequately looked for adverse events, or study authors might not have reported them fully. Also, the number of children evaluated was too small and the time of follow‐up too short to allow review authors to draw any conclusions about their safety. 
Conclusion 
This systematic review showed that antifibrinolytic drugs reduce blood loss and decrease the number of children receiving blood transfusions and the amount of blood transfused, but the evidence supporting any of these findings is not very strong. The safety of antifibrinolytic drugs remains unclear.","# Plain Language Summary: Blood Loss Reduction During Scoliosis Surgery in Children

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether certain medicines can help reduce bleeding during surgery to correct scoliosis (a curved spine) in children. Scoliosis surgery can cause a lot of bleeding, and doctors sometimes give children blood transfusions. Researchers wanted to know if three specific medicines could reduce bleeding and the need for transfusions.

## Who was studied?

The review included 9 studies with a total of 455 children (18 years old and younger) who had scoliosis surgery.

## What medicines were tested?

Three medicines were studied:
- Aprotinin
- Tranexamic acid
- Aminocaproic acid

These medicines work by helping blood clot better to reduce bleeding.

## What did researchers find?

**Main results:**
- Children who received these medicines lost about 427 milliliters (roughly 1.5 cups) less blood during and after surgery compared to children who didn't receive the medicine
- Fewer children who received these medicines needed blood transfusions
- Children who received these medicines needed less blood transfused overall

**Safety:**
- No deaths were reported in any group
- Very few side effects were reported
- Doctors did not carefully track side effects in most studies, so we don't know all the risks

## Bottom line

These medicines appear to help reduce bleeding and the need for blood transfusions during scoliosis surgery in children. However, the evidence is not very strong, and more research is needed to confirm safety and find the best dose.","### Summary of Scoliosis Surgery Trial

**Purpose of Study:**
Researchers wanted to find out if certain medicines, called antifibrinolytics, can help reduce blood loss and the need for blood transfusions during and after surgery to correct scoliosis in children.

**Who Participated:**
The study looked at children 18 years old or younger who had scoliosis surgery. A total of 455 children were involved in nine different studies.

**What They Did:**
The researchers compared three medicines—aprotinin, tranexamic acid, and aminocaproic acid—with a placebo (a dummy treatment). They measured how much blood was lost during and after surgery and how many children needed blood transfusions.

**Key Findings:**
- The medicines helped reduce blood loss by about 427 milliliters, which is a bit more than a standard soda can's worth.
- Fewer children needed transfusions when they received these medicines compared to the placebo.
- On average, the medicines reduced the amount of blood transfused by 327 milliliters.
- No deaths were reported in any of the studies.

**Safety:**
- The study did not find enough information to be sure about the safety of these medicines. However, it seems that serious side effects were rare.

**Conclusion:**
Antifibrinolytic medicines might help reduce blood loss and the need for transfusions in children having scoliosis surgery. But, we still don’t know enough about which medicine works best or is safest. More research is needed to answer these questions."
"Background
Smoking bans have been implemented in a variety of settings, as well as being part of policy in many jurisdictions to protect the public and employees from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke (SHS). They also offer the potential to influence social norms and the smoking behaviour of those populations they affect. Since the first version of this review in 2010, more countries have introduced national smoking legislation banning indoor smoking. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of legislative smoking bans on (1) morbidity and mortality from exposure to secondhand smoke, and (2) smoking prevalence and tobacco consumption. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and reference lists of included studies. We also checked websites of various organisations. Date of most recent search; February 2015. 
Selection criteria
We considered studies that reported legislative smoking bans affecting populations. The minimum standard was having an indoor smoking ban explicitly in the study and a minimum of six months follow‐up for measures of smoking behaviour. Our search included a broad range of research designs including: randomized controlled trials, quasi‐experimental studies (i.e. non‐randomized controlled studies), controlled before‐and‐after studies, interrupted time series as defined by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group, and uncontrolled pre‐ and post‐ban data. 
Data collection and analysis
One author extracted characteristics and content of the interventions, participants, outcomes and methods of the included studies and a second author checked the details. We extracted health and smoking behaviour outcomes. We did not attempt a meta‐analysis due to the heterogeneity in design and content of the studies included. We evaluated the studies using qualitative narrative synthesis. 
Main results
There are 77 studies included in this updated review. We retained 12 studies from the original review and identified 65 new studies. Evidence from 21 countries is provided in this update, an increase of eight countries from the original review. The nature of the intervention precludes randomized controlled trials. Thirty‐six studies used an interrupted time series study design, 23 studies use a controlled before‐and‐after design and 18 studies are before‐and‐after studies with no control group; six of these studies use a cohort design. Seventy‐two studies reported health outcomes, including cardiovascular (44), respiratory (21), and perinatal outcomes (7). Eleven studies reported national mortality rates for smoking‐related diseases. A number of the studies report multiple health outcomes. There is consistent evidence of a positive impact of national smoking bans on improving cardiovascular health outcomes, and reducing mortality for associated smoking‐related illnesses. Effects on respiratory and perinatal health were less consistent. We found 24 studies evaluating the impact of national smoke‐free legislation on smoking behaviour. Evidence of an impact of legislative bans on smoking prevalence and tobacco consumption is inconsistent, with some studies not detecting additional long‐term change in existing trends in prevalence. 
Authors' conclusions
Since the first version of this review was published, the current evidence provides more robust support for the previous conclusions that the introduction of a legislative smoking ban does lead to improved health outcomes through reduction in SHS for countries and their populations. The clearest evidence is observed in reduced admissions for acute coronary syndrome. There is evidence of reduced mortality from smoking‐related illnesses at a national level. There is inconsistent evidence of an impact on respiratory and perinatal health outcomes, and on smoking prevalence and tobacco consumption.","Does legislation to ban smoking reduce exposure to secondhand smoke and smoking behaviour?
Since the first national legislation banning indoor smoking in all public places was introduced in 2004, there has been an increase in the number of countries, states and regions adopting similar smoke‐free legislation banning smoking in public places and work places since this review was first published. The main reason is to protect nonsmokers from the harmful health effects of exposure to secondhand smoke. Another reason is to provide a supportive environment for people who want to quit smoking. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that investigated the effect of introducing a ban on any measures of health, or on smoking behaviour (up to February 2015). Since the previous version of this review had shown clear evidence that introducing legislation to ban smoking in public places does reduce exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) in those places, we did not include studies that only reported exposure to SHS. We included 77 studies from 21 countries in this updated review. Studies of health outcomes typically used data from hospitals to look for changes in rates of admissions, discharges or deaths. Most studies looked at illnesses related to the cardiovascular system (heart or blood vessels), such as heart attacks and strokes. Studies also looked at effects on respiratory health, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g. bronchitis), asthma and lung function. Seven studies looked at the health of newborn children. Eleven studies reported death rates. The best‐quality studies collected data at multiple time points before and after the introduction of a ban in order to adjust for existing time trends. Some studies could compare events rates in areas with and without bans, or where bans were introduced at different times. 
Key results 
There is evidence that countries and their populations benefit from improved health after introducing smoking bans, importantly to do with the heart and blood vessels. We found evidence of reduced deaths. The impact of bans on respiratory health, on the health of newborn children, and on reducing the number of smokers and their cigarette use is not as clear, with some studies not detecting any reduction. 
Quality of the evidence 
Legislative bans have not been evaluated by randomized trials, and the quality of the evidence from the types of studies contributing to this review is lower. Changes in health outcomes could be due to other things, such as change in healthcare practices. However, many of the studies used methods of analysis that could control for underlying trends, and increase our confidence that any changes are caused by the introduction of bans.","# Plain Language Summary: Smoking Bans and Health

## What is this study about?

Researchers looked at what happens when governments pass laws that ban smoking inside buildings. They wanted to see if these laws help people's health and whether they change how many people smoke.

## Why does this matter?

Secondhand smoke (smoke from other people's cigarettes) can make people sick. Many countries have created smoking bans to protect people who don't smoke. Scientists wanted to know if these laws actually work.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for studies from around the world about smoking bans. They looked at 77 different studies from 21 countries. Most studies compared health and smoking rates before and after smoking bans were put in place. They looked at what happened over at least six months.

## What did they find?

**Health improvements:** The laws helped people's hearts stay healthier. Fewer people went to the hospital with heart problems after smoking bans started. Fewer people also died from smoking-related diseases.

**Breathing and pregnancy:** The effects on lung health and pregnancy outcomes were mixed—some studies showed improvement, but others didn't.

**Smoking rates:** The results were unclear. Some studies showed fewer people smoked after the bans, but others didn't see much change in smoking rates.

## Bottom line

Smoking bans appear to help protect people's heart health and reduce deaths from smoking-related illnesses. The strongest proof is for heart health improvements.","**Plain Language Summary:**

This study looked at how smoking bans in different countries affect people's health and smoking habits.

**Purpose:**

The aim was to see if these bans help reduce health problems and deaths caused by secondhand smoke, and if they change how many people smoke or how much they smoke.

**How We Did It:**

Researchers checked different studies from around the world. These studies had to include indoor smoking bans and measure their effects for at least six months. We looked at many types of studies.

**Key Findings:**

- We included 77 studies from 21 countries.
- The research showed that smoking bans improve health, especially heart health, and lower death rates related to smoking. However, the effects on lung health and babies' health were less clear.
- Some studies said smoking bans helped reduce smoking, but others didn't find long-term changes.

**Conclusion:**

The evidence strongly supports that smoking bans improve health by reducing secondhand smoke, especially for heart-related problems. The impact on smoking habits and other health areas is less clear."
"Background
The term ""strabismus"" describes misalignment of the eyes. One or both eyes may deviate inward, outward, upward, or downward. Dissociated vertical deviation (DVD) is a well‐recognized type of upward drifting of one or both eyes, which can occur in children or adults. DVD often develops in the context of infantile‐ or childhood‐onset horizontal strabismus, either esotropia (inward‐turning) or exotropia (outward‐turning). For some individuals, DVD remains controlled and can only be detected during clinical testing. For others, DVD becomes spontaneously ""manifest"" and the eye drifts up of its own accord. Spontaneously manifest DVD can be difficult to control and often causes psychosocial concerns. Traditionally, DVD has been thought to be asymptomatic, although some individuals have double vision. More recently it has been suggested that individuals with DVD may also suffer from eyestrain. Treatment for DVD may be sought either due to psychosocial concerns or because of these symptoms. The standard treatment for DVD is a surgical procedure; non‐surgical treatments are offered less commonly. Although there are many studies evaluating different management options for the correction of DVD, a lack of clarity remains regarding which treatments are most effective. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness and safety of various surgical and non‐surgical interventions in randomized controlled trials of participants with DVD. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2015, Issue 8), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2015), PubMed (1948 to August 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to August 2015), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled‐trials.com) (last searched 3 February 2014), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 3 August 2015. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of surgical and non‐surgical interventions for the correction of DVD. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently completed eligibility screening, data abstraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and grading of the evidence. 
Main results
We found four RCTs eligible for inclusion in this review (248 eyes of 151 participants between the ages of 6 months to 22 years). All trials were assessed as having unclear risk of bias overall due to insufficient reporting of study methods. One trial was conducted in Canada and compared anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle with resection versus anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle alone; one in the USA compared superior rectus recession with posterior fixation suture versus superior rectus recession alone; and two in the Czech Republic compared anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle versus myectomy of the inferior oblique muscle. 
Only one trial reported data that allowed analysis of the primary outcome for this review, the proportion of participants with treatment success. The difference between inferior oblique anteriorization plus resection versus inferior oblique anteriorization alone was uncertain when measured at least four months postoperatively (risk ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 2.11, 30 participants, very low‐quality evidence). Three trials measured the magnitude of hyperdeviation, but did not provide sufficient data for analysis. All four trials reported a relatively low rate of adverse events; hypotropia, limited elevation, and need for repeat surgery were reported as adverse events associated with some of the surgical interventions. No trials reported any other secondary outcome specified for our review. 
Authors' conclusions
The four trials included in this review assessed the effectiveness of five different surgical procedures for the treatment of DVD. Nevertheless, insufficient reporting of study methods and data led to methodological concerns that undermine the conclusions of all studies. There is a pressing need for carefully executed RCTs of treatment for DVD in order to improve the evidence for the optimal management of this condition.","Treatment for eyes that drift upwards
Review question  The aim of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of surgical and non‐surgical treatments for dissociated vertical deviation. 
Background  Eye misalignment (strabismus) is the drifting of one or both eyes, which can be inward, outward, upward, or downward. This review evaluated the treatment for a specific type of upward drifting of one or both eyes known as dissociated vertical deviation (DVD). DVD can occur in both children and adults. For some people, DVD is controlled and is only detectable during testing. In others, DVD happens all of a sudden as the eye drifts up of its accord. It can be hard for the person to gain control of the eye, which can cause distress to the person in social situations. The condition also may cause double vision or eyestrain. 
Surgery is the common treatment for DVD. Treatments that do not involve surgery are uncommon. There is limited evidence about the effectiveness of treatments (either surgical or non‐surgical) for DVD. 
Study characteristics  We conducted the search for studies on 3 August 2015. We found four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of surgical treatment for DVD. We found no studies evaluating non‐surgical treatments. One trial was conducted in Canada and compared a surgical repositioning procedure (anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle) with or without resection; one in the USA compared surgical weakening of an eye muscle (superior rectus recession) with or without augmentation with a fixation suture; and two in the Czech Republic compared anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle versus removal of a piece of the inferior oblique muscle (myectomy). 
Key results  Only one of the RCTs examined what we wanted to know: the proportion of participants who had surgical success. There was insufficient information available to determine the differences between any of the surgical procedures with respect to surgical success or any other outcome relevant to our review. The most common adverse events from the surgical procedures were downward drifting of the eye after surgery (hypotropia), limited upward movement of the eye, and need for repeat surgery. 
Quality of the evidence  All four of the included studies had flaws in design, execution, or both that weaken their conclusions. There is a need for well‐designed, rigorously conducted RCTs of treatments for DVD to provide more reliable evidence for the management of this condition.","# Plain Language Summary: Treatments for Dissociated Vertical Deviation (DVD)

## What is DVD?

DVD is a condition where one or both eyes drift upward on their own. It often happens in people who have other eye alignment problems. Some people can hide it, but others notice their eye drifting up, which can be embarrassing or cause eye strain or double vision.

## Why This Study Matters

Doctors usually treat DVD with surgery, but we don't know for sure which surgery works best. This review looked at research studies to find out which treatments work and are safe.

## What the Researchers Did

The researchers searched for high-quality studies that tested different surgical treatments for DVD. They looked for studies where people were randomly chosen to receive different treatments so the results would be fair and trustworthy.

## What They Found

The researchers found only 4 good-quality studies with a total of 151 people (mostly children and young adults, ages 6 months to 22 years). All four studies tested different types of eye muscle surgery.

The studies tested five different surgical procedures:
- Moving and tightening the eye muscle
- Moving the eye muscle alone
- Tightening the upper eye muscle with special stitches
- Removing part of the eye muscle

## Results

Only one study had clear enough information to analyze. That study showed uncertain results—the researchers couldn't tell if one surgery was better than another.

The good news: All surgeries had low rates of serious problems. Some side effects included eyes turning down too much, trouble moving the eye up, or needing another surgery.

## Bottom Line

We don't have enough strong evidence yet to say which DVD surgery works best. Doctors need to do more careful, well-designed studies to find the best treatment.","### Plain Language Summary: Studying Treatments for Eye Misalignment

**What is the study about?**

**What's the goal of the study?**
The goal is to find out how safe and effective different treatments are for fixing DVD. This includes both surgeries and other non-surgical methods.

**Who was in the study?**
The study looked at 151 people, aged 6 months to 22 years, who have DVD.

**What treatments were tested?**
The study tested five different surgeries to fix the eye misalignment. These surgeries involved adjusting certain eye muscles.

**What did they find?**
- Only one trial gave enough data to see how well one of the surgeries worked, but the results weren’t clear.
- All surgeries had some complications, like needing another surgery or difficulty moving the eye.
- Overall, the studies didn’t give enough clear information to decide which treatment is best.

**What’s next?**
More carefully done studies are needed to figure out the best way to treat DVD. 

**Are the treatments safe?**
The surgeries had low rates of problems, but some issues did come up, such as limited eye movement.

This Cochrane Review update aims to assess the effects of engaging community‐based workers, such as primary‐care workers and teachers, to help people with mental disorders or distress. The review focused on studies from low‐ and middle‐income countries and found 95 studies for inclusion (including 23 from the previous review).  
Key messages 
Primary health professionals, lay health workers, teachers, and other community workers may be able to help people with mental health issues if they are trained. However, more evidence is needed.  
What was studied in the review? 
In low‐ and middle‐income countries, many people with mental illness do not receive the care they need because of stigma and difficulty accessing services. One solution is to offer services through ‘primary‐level workers’. These are people who are not mental health specialists but who receive some mental health training, including primary health professionals (e.g. doctors, nurses); lay health workers; community volunteers; and other community members (e.g. teachers, social workers). Primary‐level workers deliver these services alone or in collaboration with specialists. 
What are the main results of the review? 
95 relevant trials from 30 low‐ or middle‐income countries were found. 
The review authors searched for evidence about the effects of these strategies on the number of people who had mental health problems, the number who recovered, their symptom severity, quality of life, day‐to‐day functioning, use of health services, and negative effects of treatment. All results were measured one to six months after treatment completion, except in group 5, in which results were measured immediately after treatment completion. When results are not presented, this is because there was no evidence, or because the evidence was very uncertain. Evidence of the results below is of low to moderate certainty. 
1. Adults with depression and anxiety 
Treatments from lay health workers compared to usual care:
a. may increase recovery;
b. may reduce the number of people with depression/anxiety; 
c. may improve quality of life;
d. may slightly improve day‐to‐day functioning; and
e. may reduce risk of suicidal thoughts/attempts.
Treatments from primary‐level workers in collaboration with mental health specialists compared to usual care: 
a. may increase recovery;
b. may reduce the number of people with depression/anxiety although the range for the actual effect indicates they may have little or no effect; 
c. may slightly reduce symptoms;
d. may slightly improve quality of life;
e. probably have little to no effect on day‐to‐day functioning; and
f. may reduce referral to mental health specialists.
2. Women with depression related to pregnancy and childbirth 
Treatments from lay health workers compared to usual care:
a. may increase recovery;
b. probably slightly reduce symptoms of depression;
c. may slightly improve day‐to‐day functioning; 
d. may have little to no effect on risk of death.
3. Adults in humanitarian settings with post‐traumatic stress or depression and anxiety 
Treatments from lay health workers compared to usual care:
a. may slightly reduce depression symptoms; and
b. probably slightly improve quality of life.
Treatments from primary health professionals compared to usual care:
a. may reduce the number of adults with post‐traumatic stress and depression.
4. Adults with alcohol or substance use problems  
Treatments from lay health workers compared to usual care:
a. may increase recovery from harmful/hazardous alcohol use although the range for the actual effect indicates they may have little or no effect; 
b. probably slightly reduce the risk of harmful/hazardous alcohol use;
c. may have little to no effect on day‐to‐day functioning; and
d. may have little to no effect on the number of people who use methamphetamine;
Treatments from primary health and community professionals compared to usual care:
a. probably have little to no effect on recovery from harmful/hazardous alcohol use;
b. probably slightly reduce risk of harmful/hazardous alcohol and substance use; and
c. probably have little to no effect on quality of life.
5. Adults with severe mental disorders (e.g. schizophrenia) 
Treatments from lay health workers compared to mental specialists alone:
a. may have little to no effect on caregiver burden.
Treatments from primary health professionals alone or in collaboration with mental health specialists: 
a. may improve day‐to‐day functioning.
6. Adults with dementia and their carers 
Treatments from lay and professional health workers, compared to usual care:
a. may have little to no effect on the severity of behavioural symptoms in dementia patients; and 
b. may reduce carers' mental distress.
7. Children in humanitarian settings with post‐traumatic stress or depression and anxiety 
Treatments from lay health workers, compared to usual or no care:
a. may have little to no effect on post‐traumatic stress symptoms;
b. probably have little to no effect on depressive symptoms nor on day‐to‐day functioning; and 
c. may make little or no difference in risk of adverse events.
Treatments from community professionals (teachers and social workers) compared to no care: 
a. may have little to no effect on depressive symptoms; and
b. may make little or no difference in adverse events.

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether community workers can help people with mental health problems in poorer countries. Community workers are regular people from the community (not doctors) who are trained to help others with mental health issues.

## Who was studied?

The review included 95 different studies from 30 poorer countries. These studies looked at:
- Adults with depression and anxiety
- Pregnant women and new mothers with depression
- People who experienced trauma
- People with alcohol or drug problems
- People with serious mental illness
- People with dementia and their caregivers
- Children with trauma or depression

## What did they test?

Researchers compared two approaches:
1. **Community workers providing treatment** (trained lay people, health workers, or other community members)
2. **Regular care** (what people normally received)

They measured whether people got better, had fewer symptoms, improved their daily functioning, and had better quality of life.

## Main findings

**Community workers helped with:**
- Depression and anxiety in adults
- Depression in pregnant women and new mothers
- Trauma-related problems
- Alcohol and drug use problems
- Caregiver stress in families with dementia

**Results were mixed or unclear for:**
- Serious mental illness
- Children's trauma and depression
- Some types of substance dependence

## Important notes

- Most studies had some quality concerns
- Benefits were usually small to moderate
- Community worker programs were often as good as regular care, sometimes better
- More research is needed in some areas

## Bottom line

Community workers can be a helpful way to treat mental health problems in poorer countries where there aren't enough doctors and specialists.","### Study Summary

**Purpose of the Study**
This study looked at how well local community workers help people with mental health issues in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). These workers are not doctors but include primary health workers, lay health workers, and community helpers. The study compared their help to regular care.

**Who Was Studied**
The study included many trials involving adults and children dealing with everyday mental health challenges, those in stressful situations, those with harmful alcohol or drug use, and older people with dementia, along with their caregivers.

**What They Did**
Community workers led various mental health support programs. The study analyzed how these programs affected people's recovery, symptoms, quality of life, daily functioning, and use of health services. They checked results at different times after starting the programs: less than 1 month, 1–6 months, and over 6 months.

**Key Findings**
- For adults with common mental disorders, lay health workers may help improve recovery, reduce symptoms, and enhance quality of life.
- Collaborative care might help increase recovery and slightly reduce symptoms.
- For women with depression around childbirth, lay health workers may help with recovery and reduce symptoms a bit.
- In adults facing stressful situations, lay health workers may slightly improve feelings of depression and quality of life.
- For people using drugs or alcohol harmfully, lay health workers might help a bit with alcohol use, but not much is clear on other substances.
- Community programs may help caregivers of people with dementia feel less stressed.

**Conclusion**
Using community-based workers shows promise in supporting mental health improvements in different groups from low- and middle-income areas. Further studies could help confirm these results and guide future health programs."
"Background
Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia are becoming increasingly common with the aging of most populations. The majority of individuals with dementia will first present for care and assessment in primary care settings. There is a need for brief dementia screening instruments that can accurately detect dementia in primary care settings. The Mini‐Cog is a brief, cognitive screening test that is frequently used to evaluate cognition in older adults in various settings. 
Objectives
To determine the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog for detecting dementia in a primary care setting. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Register of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies, MEDLINE, Embase and four other databases, initially to September 2012. Since then, four updates to the search were performed using the same search methods, and the most recent was January 2017. We used citation tracking (using the databases' ‘related articles’ feature, where available) as an additional search method and contacted authors of eligible studies for unpublished data. 
Selection criteria
We only included studies that evaluated the Mini‐Cog as an index test for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia or related forms of dementia when compared to a reference standard using validated criteria for dementia. We only included studies that were conducted in primary care populations. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted and described information on the characteristics of the study participants and study setting. Using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2) criteria we evaluated the quality of studies, and we assessed risk of bias and applicability of each study for each domain in QUADAS‐2. Two review authors independently extracted information on the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives and entered the data into Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5). We then used RevMan 5 to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and 95% confidence intervals. We summarized the sensitivity and specificity of the Mini‐Cog in the individual studies in forest plots and also plotted them in a receiver operating characteristic plot. We also created a 'Risk of bias' and applicability concerns graph to summarize information related to the quality of included studies. 
Main results
There were a total of four studies that met our inclusion criteria, including a total of 1517 total participants. The sensitivity of the Mini‐Cog varied between 0.76 to 1.00 in studies while the specificity varied between 0.27 to 0.85. The included studies displayed significant heterogeneity in both methodologies and clinical populations, which did not allow for a meta‐analysis to be completed. Only one study (Holsinger 2012) was found to be at low risk of bias on all methodological domains. The results of this study reported that the sensitivity of the Mini‐Cog was 0.76 and the specificity was 0.73. We found the quality of all other included studies to be low due to a high risk of bias with methodological limitations primarily in their selection of participants. 
Authors' conclusions
There is a limited number of studies evaluating the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog for the diagnosis of dementia in primary care settings. Given the small number of studies, the wide range in estimates of the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog, and methodological limitations identified in most of the studies, at the present time there is insufficient evidence to recommend that the Mini‐Cog be used as a screening test for dementia in primary care. Further studies are required to determine the accuracy of Mini‐Cog in primary care and whether this tool has sufficient diagnostic test accuracy to be useful as a screening test in this setting.","How accurate is the mini‐cog test when used to assess dementia in general practice?
Background and rationale for review 
In most parts of the world there are increasing numbers of older adults, and memory complaints and conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia are becoming increasingly common as a result. Most individuals with memory difficulties will first seek out care or be identified in the healthcare system through their primary care health care providers, which may include family physicians or nurses. Therefore, there is a need for tools that could identify individuals who may have dementia or significant memory problems. These tools should also be able to rule out dementia in those individuals with memory complaints who do not have dementia or significant memory problems. Such tools in primary care must be relatively easy to use, quick to administer, and accurate so as to be feasible to use in primary care while at the same time not overdiagnose or underdiagnose dementia. The Mini‐Cog, a brief cognitive screening tool, has been suggested as a possible screening test for dementia in primary care as it has been reported to be accurate and relatively easy to administer in primary care settings. The Mini‐Cog consists of a memory task that involves recall of three words and an evaluation of a clock drawing task. 
Study characteristics 
We searched electronic databases for articles evaluating the Mini‐Cog and this evidence is current as of January 2017. The purpose of our review was to compare the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog for detecting dementia of any type in primary care settings when compared to in‐depth evaluation conducted by dementia specialists. We included studies that evaluated individuals with any potential severity of dementia and regardless of whether previous cognitive testing had been completed prior to the Mini‐Cog. Overall, our review identified four studies conducted in primary care settings that compared the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog to detailed assessment of dementia by dementia specialists. 
Quality of the evidence 
Of the four studies included in the review, all except one study had limitations in how the Mini‐Cog was evaluated, which may have led to an overestimation of the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog in the remaining studies. Notably, the most problematic issue in study quality related to how participants were selected to participate in research studies, which may have further contributed to an overestimation of the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog in most of the studies included in our review. 
Key findings 
The results of the highest‐quality study Holsinger 2012 found that the Mini‐Cog had a sensitivity of 76%, indicating that the Mini‐Cog failed to detect up to 24% of individuals who have dementia (e.g. false negatives). In this same study, the specificity of the Mini‐Cog was 73% indicating that up to 27% of individuals may be incorrectly identified as having dementia on the Mini‐Cog when these individuals do not actually have an underlying dementia (e.g. false positives). We conclude that at the present time there is not enough evidence to support the routine use of the Mini‐Cog as a screening test for dementia in primary care and additional studies are required before concluding that the Mini‐Cog is useful in this setting.","# Plain Language Summary: Mini-Cog Test for Detecting Dementia in Primary Care

## What is this study about?

This study looked at how well a short test called the Mini-Cog works at finding dementia (memory loss and thinking problems) in doctor's offices. Dementia is becoming more common as people get older, and many people first see their regular doctor about memory concerns.

## What is the Mini-Cog?

The Mini-Cog is a quick test that checks how well someone's brain is working. Doctors often use it with older adults in different places.

## What did researchers want to find out?

Researchers wanted to know: **Does the Mini-Cog accurately find dementia when used in primary care settings (regular doctor's offices)?**

## How did they do this?

The researchers looked for all studies that tested the Mini-Cog in primary care offices. They searched medical databases through January 2017 and checked study quality carefully.

## What did they find?

- **4 studies** with **1,517 people total** met the requirements
- The test caught dementia between **76% to 100%** of the time
- The test correctly ruled out dementia between **27% to 85%** of the time
- Only **1 study** was considered high quality
- The studies were very different from each other, so researchers couldn't combine the results

## What does this mean?

**Right now, there is not enough good evidence to say the Mini-Cog should be used to screen for dementia in doctor's offices.** The results varied too much between studies, and most studies had problems with how they were done.

## What's next?

**More and better studies are needed** to figure out if the Mini-Cog is accurate enough to use as a screening test in primary care.","### Study Summary: Evaluating the Mini-Cog Test for Detecting Dementia

**Why This Study?**
As people get older, many develop dementia. Most will first see a doctor in a primary care clinic. It’s important to have quick tests to identify dementia early. The Mini-Cog test is a short test often used to check memory and thinking in older adults. This study aims to see how well the Mini-Cog test works in primary care settings.

**What Was Done?**
Researchers searched for studies up to January 2017 that involved the Mini-Cog test in primary care. They looked for studies where the Mini-Cog results were compared to another standard test. In total, they analyzed four studies with 1,517 participants.

**How Was the Study Conducted?**
The researchers carefully reviewed each study for quality. They looked for true positives (correctly identified cases), true negatives (correctly identified non-cases), false positives, and false negatives. They used a software tool to calculate how sensitive (ability to detect dementia) and specific (ability to rule out non-dementia) the Mini-Cog test was.

**What Were the Results?**
The sensitivity (ability to find dementia) ranged from 76% to 100%. The specificity (ability to rule out non-dementia) ranged from 27% to 85%. One study conducted by Holsinger in 2012 showed medium accuracy and had low risk of errors.

**Conclusion**
There aren’t many studies about the Mini-Cog test in primary care, and the existing ones show mixed results. Most studies had some problems in how they were conducted, making it hard to trust the results fully. Right now, there isn't enough proof to recommend the Mini-Cog for checking dementia in primary care. More research is needed to see if it’s a useful tool in these settings."
"Background
Two major determinants of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are a sedentary lifestyle and stress. Qigong involves physical exercise, mind regulation and breathing control to restore the flow of Qi (a pivotal life energy). As it is thought to help reduce stress and involves exercise, qigong may be an effective strategy for the primary prevention of CVD. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of qigong for the primary prevention of CVD.
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (November 2014, Issue 10 of 12); MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to 2014 October week 4); EMBASE Classic + EMBASE (Ovid) (1947 to 2014 November 4); Web of Science Core Collection (1970 to 31 October 2014); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment Database and Health Economics Evaluations Database (November 2014, Issue 4 of 4). We searched several Asian databases (inception to July 2013) and the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (inception to December 2013), as well as trial registers and reference lists of reviews and articles; we also approached experts in the field and applied no language restrictions in our search. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials lasting at least three months involving healthy adults or those at high risk of CVD. Trials examined any type of qigong, and comparison groups provided no intervention or minimal intervention. Outcomes of interest included clinical CVD events and major CVD risk factors. We did not include trials that involved multi‐factorial lifestyle interventions or weight loss. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion. Two review authors extracted data from included studies and assessed the risk of bias. 
Main results
We identified 11 completed trials (1369 participants) and one ongoing trial. Trials were heterogeneous in participants recruited, qigong duration and length of follow‐up periods. We were unable to ascertain the risk of bias in nine trials published in Chinese, as insufficient methodological details were reported and we were unable to contact the study authors to clarify this. 
We performed no meta‐analyses, as trials were small and were at significant risk of bias. Clinical events were detailed in subsequent reports of two trials when statistically significant effects of qigong were seen for all‐cause mortality, stroke mortality and stroke incidence at 20 to 30 years after completion of the trials. However, these trials were designed to examine outcomes in the short term, and it is not clear whether qigong was practised during extended periods of follow‐up; therefore effects cannot be attributed to the intervention. None of the included studies reported other non‐fatal CVD events. 
Six trials provided data that could be used to examine the effects of qigong on blood pressure. Reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were seen in three and two trials, respectively. Three trials examined the effects of qigong on blood lipids when favourable effects were seen in one trial for total cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides, and two trials showed favourable effects on high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The only trial considered at low risk of selection and detection bias did not demonstrate statistically significant effects on CVD risk factors with qigong, but this study was small and was underpowered. None of the included studies reported incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), adverse events, quality of life or costs. 
Authors' conclusions
Currently, very limited evidence is available on the effectiveness of qigong for the primary prevention of CVD. Most of the trials included in this review are likely to be at high risk of bias, so we have very low confidence in the validity of the results. Publication of the ongoing trial will add to the limited evidence base, but further trials of high methodological quality with sufficient sample size and follow‐up are needed to be incorporated in an update of this review before the effectiveness of qigong for CVD prevention can be established.","Qigong to prevent cardiovascular disease
Review question 
This review assessed the effectiveness of qigong interventions for reducing cardiovascular events and cardiovascular risk factors among healthy adults and those at high risk of cardiovascular disease. 
Background 
Cardiovascular disease is a global health burden. However, by changing several modifiable behaviours, such as by increasing exercise levels and by promoting relaxation to reduce stress, it is thought that cardiovascular risk can be reduced. Qigong originated in China and involves physical exercise, mind regulation and breathing control to restore Qi (the life energy force that flows around the body). Qigong might reduce stress and increase exercise levels. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to November 2014. We included trials with interventions lasting at least three months. 
Results and conclusion 
We found 11 completed trials (1369 participants). These trials showed variation in participants recruited, duration of qigong and follow‐up of the interventions. For two trials that were followed up for many years after trial completion, results showed that qigong had a beneficial effect on all‐cause mortality, stroke mortality and stroke incidence, but it is not clear whether this effect can be attributed to qigong, as it is uncertain whether qigong was practised during the years after the trials ended. Some beneficial effects of qigong on blood pressure and blood lipid levels were observed, but these results were based on only a small number of studies with small sample size that were at significant risk of bias. Therefore, additional large, high‐quality, long‐term trials are needed before we will be able to determine whether qigong is beneficial for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.","# Plain Language Summary: Qigong for Heart Disease Prevention

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether qigong can help prevent heart disease in healthy people or those at higher risk. Qigong is a practice that combines exercise, breathing techniques, and mental focus.

## Why does this matter?

Two major things that increase heart disease risk are not exercising enough and being stressed. Since qigong involves both movement and stress relief, researchers wanted to know if it could help prevent heart disease.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for studies that tested qigong in healthy adults or people at risk for heart disease. They looked for studies that lasted at least three months and compared qigong to no treatment or minimal treatment. They found 11 completed studies with about 1,369 people total, plus one study still ongoing.

## What did they find?

**The bottom line:** There is not enough good evidence yet to say whether qigong prevents heart disease.

**What the studies showed:**
- Some studies found small improvements in blood pressure
- A few studies showed improvements in cholesterol levels
- Two studies reported fewer heart-related deaths 20-30 years later, but it's unclear if people kept practicing qigong all that time
- Most studies had quality problems that make the results less trustworthy

## What's missing?

The studies didn't report on:
- Heart attacks or strokes
- New cases of diabetes
- Side effects
- Quality of life
- Costs

## What happens next?

Researchers need larger, better-designed studies before they can confidently say whether qigong prevents heart disease.","**Summary of Qigong and Heart Health Study**

**Purpose of the Study:**
This study looked at whether qigong, a mind and body exercise, can help prevent heart disease. Because qigong involves movement and breathing exercises, it might help reduce stress and improve heart health.

**Who Was Studied:**
Researchers looked at high-quality studies involving healthy adults and those at risk for heart disease. People in the studies practiced qigong for at least three months.

**What They Did:**
The researchers reviewed different studies that compared people doing qigong with those who did little or no exercise. They focused on changes in heart-related health, like blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

**What They Found:**
- Some studies showed that qigong might help lower blood pressure and improve cholesterol.
- However, the studies were small and had some flaws, making it hard to be sure of the results.
- It’s still not clear if qigong can prevent serious heart problems over a long time.

**Safety and Other Considerations:**
- None of the studies reported serious side effects from qigong.
- The studies didn’t discuss the effects on quality of life or costs.

**Conclusion:**
Right now, there isn’t enough strong evidence to say if qigong can prevent heart disease. Better and bigger studies are needed to find out more."
"Background
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly lethal disease with few effective treatment options. Over the past few decades, many anti‐cancer therapies have been tested in the locally advanced and metastatic setting, with mixed results. This review attempts to synthesise all the randomised data available to help better inform patient and clinician decision‐making when dealing with this difficult disease. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both for first‐line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. Our primary outcome was overall survival, while secondary outcomes include progression‐free survival, grade 3/4 adverse events, therapy response and quality of life. 
Search methods
We searched for published and unpublished studies in CENTRAL (searched 14 June 2017), Embase (1980 to 14 June 2017), MEDLINE (1946 to 14 June 2017) and CANCERLIT (1999 to 2002) databases. We also handsearched all relevant conference abstracts published up until 14 June 2017. 
Selection criteria
All randomised studies assessing overall survival outcomes in patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy, alone or in combination, were the eligible treatments. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently analysed studies, and a third settled any disputes. We extracted data on overall survival (OS), progression‐free survival (PFS), response rates, adverse events (AEs) and quality of life (QoL), and we assessed risk of bias for each study. 
Main results
We included 42 studies addressing chemotherapy in 9463 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. We did not identify any eligible studies on radiotherapy. 
We did not find any benefit for chemotherapy over best supportive care. However, two identified studies did not have sufficient data to be included in the analysis, and many of the chemotherapy regimens studied were outdated. 
Compared to gemcitabine alone, participants receiving 5FU had worse OS (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.27, moderate‐quality evidence), PFS (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.92) and QoL. On the other hand, two studies showed FOLFIRINOX was better than gemcitabine for OS (HR 0.51 95% CI 0.43 to 0.60, moderate‐quality evidence), PFS (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.57) and response rates (RR 3.38, 95% CI 2.01 to 5.65), but it increased the rate of side effects. The studies evaluating CO‐101, ZD9331 and exatecan did not show benefit or harm when compared with gemcitabine alone. 
Giving gemcitabine at a fixed dose rate improved OS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.94, high‐quality evidence) but increased the rate of side effects when compared with bolus dosing. 
When comparing gemcitabine combinations to gemcitabine alone, gemcitabine plus platinum improved PFS (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95) and response rates (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.98) but not OS (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08, low‐quality evidence). The rate of side effects increased. Gemcitabine plus fluoropyrimidine improved OS (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95), PFS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.87) and response rates (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.47, high‐quality evidence), but it also increased side effects. Gemcitabine plus topoisomerase inhibitor did not improve survival outcomes but did increase toxicity. One study demonstrated that gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel improved OS (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.84, high‐quality evidence), PFS (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.82) and response rates (RR 3.29, 95% CI 2.24 to 4.84) but increased side effects. Gemcitabine‐containing multi‐drug combinations (GEMOXEL or cisplatin/epirubicin/5FU/gemcitabine) improved OS (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.79, low‐quality evidence), PFS (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.62) and QOL. 
We did not find any survival advantages when comparing 5FU combinations to 5FU alone.
Authors' conclusions
Combination chemotherapy has recently overtaken the long‐standing gemcitabine as the standard of care. FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel are highly efficacious, but our analysis shows that other combination regimens also offer a benefit. Selection of the most appropriate chemotherapy for individual patients still remains difficult, with clinicopathological stratification remaining elusive. Biomarker development is essential to help rationalise treatment selection for patients.","The effects of anti‐cancer therapies on advanced pancreatic cancer
Review question 
This review aimed to answer the question, which therapies are the most effective for advanced pancreatic cancer? 
Background 
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a serious, often fatal disease, and many people are not diagnosed until they have advanced tumours that cannot be removed with surgery. Symptoms include abdominal pain, weight loss, and yellowing of the skin and eyes. Up until recently, gemcitabine was the standard drug for treating advanced pancreatic cancer, but this gave people only a modest benefit. 
Study characteristics 
We looked for all studies in people with pancreatic cancer that could not be operated on (locally advanced) or that had already spread beyond the pancreas (metastatic). We found 42 clinical studies involving 9463 participants who were receiving their first therapy for PC. Our search is current to June 2017. 
The studies compared one therapy against either best supportive care (symptom management only) or another type of therapy. Studies had to evaluate overall survival (or time to death). The study could be testing either chemotherapy (drugs that kill or slow the growth of cancer cells) or radiotherapy (X‐ray treatment). We collected data on survival, tumour response rate, side effects and quality of life. The results of clinical studies addressing targeted/biological therapies, immunotherapies, second‐line therapies and local treatments for locally advanced disease will be reported in a separate Cochrane Review. 
Key results 
This review has shown that in advanced disease, combination chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX (5‐fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin combination); GEMOXEL (gemcitabine, oxaliplatin and capecitabine); cisplatin/epirubicin/5FU/gemcitabine; gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel; and gemcitabine plus a fluoropyrimidine agent, provide a survival advantage over gemcitabine alone. These combinations do increase side effects. Gemcitabine given slowly using a fixed rate of infusion may be more effective than giving it in the standard way, which is quickly over 30 minutes. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence varied greatly amongst comparisons. The highest quality evidence was for gemcitabine versus fixed dose rate gemcitabine and some of the gemcitabine combinations (fluoropyrimidine, topoisomerase, and taxane). We judged the studies for quality using factors like how well they were conducted, how well they reported results and whether they used a placebo.","# Plain Language Summary: Chemotherapy for Advanced Pancreatic Cancer

## What is this study about?

This review looked at research studies comparing different chemotherapy treatments for people with advanced pancreatic cancer. Researchers wanted to find out which treatments help people live longer and which ones work best.

## Who was studied?

The review included 42 research studies with a total of 9,463 patients who had advanced pancreatic cancer.

## What treatments were tested?

Researchers compared different chemotherapy drugs and drug combinations, including:
- Gemcitabine (a standard drug used for many years)
- 5FU
- FOLFIRINOX (a combination of multiple drugs)
- Gemcitabine mixed with other drugs
- Other newer drug combinations

## What did researchers find?

**Best treatments:**
- **FOLFIRINOX** helped people live longer and respond better to treatment than gemcitabine alone, but caused more side effects
- **Gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel** also helped people live longer and respond better, but caused more side effects
- **Gemcitabine plus fluoropyrimidine** improved survival and response rates, with increased side effects
- **Gemcitabine given at a steady rate** (instead of all at once) improved survival but caused more side effects

**Less helpful:**
- 5FU alone was worse than gemcitabine alone
- Some newer drugs (CO-101, ZD9331, exatecan) didn't show clear benefits

## Key takeaway

Combination chemotherapy treatments now work better than single drugs. However, doctors still need better tools to choose the right treatment for each patient.","**Pancreatic Cancer Treatment Summary**

"Background
Poor nutrition occurs frequently in people with cystic fibrosis and is associated with other adverse outcomes. Oral calorie supplements are used to increase total daily calorie intake and improve weight gain. However, they are expensive and there are concerns they may reduce the amount of food eaten and not improve overall energy intake. This is an update of a previously published review. 
Objectives
To establish whether in people with cystic fibrosis, oral calorie supplements: increase daily calorie intake; and improve overall nutritional intake, nutritional indices, lung function, survival and quality of life. To assess adverse effects associated with using these supplements. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register comprising references from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We contacted companies marketing oral calorie supplements. 
Last search: 18 October 2016.
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing use of oral calorie supplements for at least one month to increase calorie intake with no specific intervention or additional nutritional advice in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently selected the included trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted the authors of included trials and obtained additional information for two trials. 
Main results
We identified 21 trials and included three, reporting results from 131 participants lasting between three months and one year. Two trials compared supplements to additional nutritional advice and one to no intervention. Two of the included trials recruited only children. In one trial the risk of bias was low across all domains, in a second trial the risk of bias was largely unclear and in the third mainly low. Blinding of participants was unclear in two of the trials. Also, in one trial the clinical condition of groups appeared to be unevenly balanced at baseline and in another trial there were concerns surrounding allocation concealment. There were no significant differences between people receiving supplements or dietary advice alone for change in weight, height, body mass index, z score or other indices of nutrition or growth. Changes in weight (kg) at three, six and 12 months respectively were: mean difference (MD) 0.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.09 to 0.72); MD 0.47 (95% CI ‐0.07 to 1.02 ); and MD 0.16 (‐0.68 to 1.00). Total calorie intake was greater in people taking supplements at 12 months, MD 265.70 (95% CI 42.94 to 488.46). There were no significant differences between the groups for anthropometric measures of body composition, lung function, gastro‐intestinal adverse effects or activity levels. Moderate quality evidence exists for the outcomes of changes in weight and height and low quality evidence exists for the outcomes of change in total calories, total fat and total protein intake as results are applicable only to children between the ages of 2 and 15 years and many post‐treatment diet diaries were not returned. Evidence for the rate of adverse events in the treatment groups was extremely limited and judged to be of very low quality 
Authors' conclusions
Oral calorie supplements do not confer any additional benefit in the nutritional management of moderately malnourished children with cystic fibrosis over and above the use of dietary advice and monitoring alone. While nutritional supplements may be used, they should not be regarded as essential. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the role of short‐term oral protein energy supplements in people with cystic fibrosis and acute weight loss and also for the long‐term nutritional management of adults with cystic fibrosis or advanced lung disease, or both.","Use of oral supplements to increase calorie intake in people with cystic fibrosis
We reviewed the evidence for the use of oral supplements to increase calorie intake in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
Cystic fibrosis affects many organs, including the digestive system, and can lead to food not being absorbed as it should be, which in turn leads to growth problems. Children with cystic fibrosis need more energy than other children, but they often have reduced appetites. Poor diet has been linked to poor outcomes in cystic fibrosis. Milks or juices containing additional calories are often added to the diets of children with cystic fibrosis to increase their total daily calorie intake and help them gain weight. However, these supplements are expensive and may not achieve the desired effect if patients take them as a substitute for calories consumed from food rather than as an additional component. In toddlers or young children use of supplements may risk compromising the development of normal eating behaviour. This is an updated version of the review. 
Search date 
We last searched for evidence on 18 October 2016.
Study characteristics 
This review includes three randomised controlled trials with a total of 131 participants and two of them only included children. Two of the trials compared supplements to dietary advice and one compared supplements to no advice. The trials lasted between three months and one year. 
Key results 
There were no major differences between people receiving supplements or just dietary advice for any nutritional or growth measurements. This was also true for measures of body composition, lung function, adverse effects on the digestive system or people's levels of activity. Advice and monitoring appear to be enough to manage the diet of moderately malnourished children. 
Future trials should look into the use of calorie supplements for acute weight loss or long‐term care for adults with cystic fibrosis. 
Quality of the evidence 
One of the trials appeared to be well run and the risk of bias was low for all the aspects of trial design that we assessed; so we do not think any bias will influence the results in a negative way. In the other two trials, we were not sure if the people taking part could guess which treatment group they were in. In one of these two trials, we further thought it was likely that the person recruiting them to the trial knew which group the participant would be in. In the second of these trials, the people in the group receiving supplements appeared to be generally in better clinical condition at the start of the trial than those who didn't receive any supplements or advice. These factors affect our confidence in the results from these trials. 
We judged the quality of the evidence for the changes in weight and height to be moderate, but judged the quality of the evidence for the changes in total calories, total fat and total protein intake as low since results are applicable only to children aged between 2 and 15 years; also many post‐treatment diet diaries were not returned to the investigators. Evidence for the rate of adverse events in the treatment groups was extremely limited and judged to be of very low quality.","# Plain Language Summary: Oral Calorie Supplements for People with Cystic Fibrosis

## What is this study about?

People with cystic fibrosis often have trouble getting enough nutrition. Doctors sometimes recommend drinking special calorie supplements to help patients eat more and gain weight. These supplements are expensive, and doctors weren't sure if they really help. This review looked at research studies to find out if these supplements actually work.

## What did researchers want to find out?

The researchers wanted to know if oral calorie supplements:
- Help people eat more calories each day
- Improve overall nutrition and weight gain
- Help lungs work better
- Help people live longer and feel better
- Cause any bad side effects

## What did they do?

Researchers looked for all studies that tested calorie supplements in people with cystic fibrosis. They compared people who drank these supplements to people who got nutrition advice instead. They looked at studies that lasted at least three months.

## What did they find?

The researchers found 3 good studies with 131 people total. Here's what happened:

- **Weight gain:** People taking supplements didn't gain more weight than people getting nutrition advice alone.
- **Calories:** People taking supplements did eat more total calories by 12 months.
- **Other measures:** There were no differences between groups in height, body measurements, lung function, or stomach problems.

## What does this mean?

Calorie supplements don't seem to help children with cystic fibrosis gain weight any better than getting good nutrition advice and being monitored by doctors. While supplements can be used, they may not be necessary.

## What's next?

More studies are needed, especially in adults with cystic fibrosis.","**Study Summary: Cystic Fibrosis and Nutrition**

**Background:**
People with cystic fibrosis often struggle with poor nutrition, which can lead to other health problems. To help, they sometimes use oral calorie supplements to boost daily calorie intake and gain weight. However, there are concerns that these supplements might not improve overall energy intake and can be costly.

**Study Goal:**
The study aimed to find out if these supplements help increase calorie intake, improve nutrition, help with lung function, survival, and quality of life for people with cystic fibrosis. It also looked at any possible negative effects of using these supplements.

**Method:**
Researchers searched databases and contacted companies for studies on oral calorie supplements used for at least a month in people with cystic fibrosis. They included studies that compared supplements with no special intervention or just extra nutritional advice.

**Results:**
- The study included three smaller studies with 131 participants. They lasted between three months to a year.
- Two studies compared supplements to extra nutrition advice, while one had no special intervention.
- No big differences were found in weight, height, or body fat when using supplements.
- People taking supplements did consume more calories after 12 months.
- There were no major differences in lung function or activity levels.
- Most of the evidence was not strong and mainly applied to children ages 2-15.

**Conclusion:**
Oral calorie supplements didn’t show extra benefits for nutrition in children with cystic fibrosis compared to just using dietary advice. Supplements can be used, but they aren't necessary. More research is needed to understand their role in people with cystic fibrosis, especially for those with serious weight loss or adults with more advanced conditions."
"Background
The use of etomidate for emergency airway interventions in critically ill patients is very common. In one large registry trial, etomidate was the most commonly used agent for this indication. Etomidate is known to suppress adrenal gland function, but it remains unclear whether or not this adrenal gland dysfunction affects mortality. 
Objectives
The primary objective was to assess, in populations of critically ill patients, whether a single induction dose of etomidate for emergency airway intervention affects mortality. 
The secondary objectives were to address, in populations of critically ill patients, whether a single induction dose of etomidate for emergency airway intervention affects adrenal gland function, organ dysfunction, or health services utilization (as measured by intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), duration of mechanical ventilation, or vasopressor requirements). 
We repeated analyses within subgroups defined by the aetiologies of critical illness, timing of adrenal gland function measurement, and the type of comparator drug used. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; CINAHL; EMBASE; LILACS; International Pharmaceutical Abstracts; Web of Science; the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE); and ISI BIOSIS Citation indexSM on 8 February 2013. We reran the searches in August 2014. We will deal with any studies of interest when we update the review. 
We also searched the Scopus database of dissertations and conference proceedings and the US Food and Drug Administration Database. We handsearched major emergency medicine, critical care, and anaesthesiology journals. 
We handsearched the conference proceedings of major emergency medicine, anaesthesia, and critical care conferences from 1990 to current, and performed a grey literature search of the following: Current Controlled Trials; National Health Service – The National Research Register; ClinicalTrials.gov; NEAR website. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials in patients undergoing emergency endotracheal intubation for critical illness, including but not limited to trauma, stroke, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, septic shock, hypovolaemic or haemorrhagic shock, and undifferentiated shock states. We included single (bolus) dose etomidate for emergency airway intervention compared to any other rapid‐acting intravenous bolus single‐dose induction agent. 
Data collection and analysis
Refinement of our initial search results by title review, and then by abstract review was carried out by three review authors. Full‐text review of potential studies was based on their adherence to our inclusion and exclusion criteria. This was decided by three independent review authors. We reported the decisions regarding inclusion and exclusion in accordance with the PRISMA statement. 
Electronic database searching yielded 1635 potential titles, and our grey literature search yielded an additional 31 potential titles. Duplicate titles were filtered leaving 1395 titles which underwent review of their titles and abstracts by three review authors. Sixty seven titles were judged to be relevant to our review, however only eight met our inclusion criteria and seven were included in our analysis. 
Main results
We included eight studies in the review and seven in the meta‐analysis. Of those seven studies, only two were judged to be at low risk of bias. Overall, no strong evidence exists that etomidate increases mortality in critically ill patients when compared to other bolus dose induction agents (odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.60, 6 studies, 772 participants, moderate quality evidence). Due to a large number of participants lost to follow‐up, we performed a post hoc sensitivity analysis. This gave a similar result (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.53). There was evidence that the use of etomidate in critically ill patients was associated with a positive adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test, and this difference was more pronounced at between 4 to 6 hours (OR 19.98; 95% CI 3.95 to 101.11) than after 12 hours (OR 2.37; 95% CI 1.61 to 3.47) post‐dosing. Etomidate's use in critically ill patients was associated with a small increase in SOFA score, indicating a higher risk of multisystem organ failure (mean difference (MD) 0.70; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.39, 2 studies, 591 participants, high quality evidence), but this difference was not clinically meaningful. Etomidate use did not have an effect on ICU LOS (MD 1.70 days; 95% CI ‐2.00 to 5.40, 4 studies, 621 participants, moderate quality evidence), hospital LOS (MD 2.41 days; 95% CI ‐7.08 to 11.91, 3 studies, 152 participants, moderate quality evidence), duration of mechanical ventilation (MD 2.14 days; 95% CI ‐1.67 to 5.95, 3 studies, 621 participants, moderate quality evidence), or duration of vasopressor use (MD 1.00 day; 95% CI ‐0.53 to 2.53, 1 study, 469 participants). 
Authors' conclusions
Although we have not found conclusive evidence that etomidate increases mortality or healthcare resource utilization in critically ill patients, it does seem to increase the risk of adrenal gland dysfunction and multi‐organ system dysfunction by a small amount. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. This evidence is judged to be of moderate quality, owing mainly to significant attrition bias in some of the smaller studies, and new research may influence the outcomes of our review. The applicability of these data may be limited by the fact that 42% of the patients in our review were intubated for ""being comatose"", a population less likely to benefit from the haemodynamic stability inherent in etomidate use, and less at risk from its potential negative downstream effects of adrenal suppression.","Etomidate for sedating critically ill people during emergency endotracheal intubation
Review question 
Does a single dose of etomidate increase mortality or complications in people who are critically ill and undergoing emergency endotracheal intubation? 
Background 
People who are critically ill often need help breathing. One way to do this is called endotracheal intubation. This involves placing a tube into the windpipe (trachea) and having a ventilator (breathing machine) help the patient breathe. 
People are often given sedative agents during endotracheal intubation to make them unaware of the procedure. Many sedative agents cause a potentially harmful drop in blood pressure. 
Etomidate is commonly used to sedate patients before endotracheal intubation because it has minimal effects on blood pressure. However, when someone is given etomidate their adrenal glands do not function as well. This may be harmful to them. 
Study characteristics 
We looked at the evidence up to February 2013 and found 1666 studies. We included eight studies in our review and seven studies (involving 772 patients) in our meta‐analysis. The studies involved people who were in an unstable condition and critically ill. They were given one dose of etomidate or another sedative agent for endotracheal intubation. We reran the search in August 2014. We will deal with any studies of interest when we update the review. 
Results 
No strong evidence exists to suggest that etomidate, when compared to other bolus dose induction agents, increases mortality in critically ill patients. We must be careful in interpreting this finding because only large studies would be able to show a difference in mortality. So far, no such study has been completed. 
Etomidate does seem to impair adrenal gland functioning. Functioning is impaired most between four and six hours after etomidate is given. 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores are used to find out how badly someone’s organs are failing. Using etomidate results in worse SOFA scores but this difference is small and not clinically meaningful. 
The effects of impaired adrenal gland functioning and higher SOFA scores on people’s health is unknown. Using etomidate does not seem to increase the length of time someone is in hospital (including an intensive care unit), the length of time a person is connected to a mechanical ventilator (a machine to assist with breathing), or the use of vasopressors (medicines to increase blood pressure). 
Quality of the evidence 
Most of the evidence was moderate quality. This is mainly because some small studies we looked at did not check up on people adequately after they were intubated. 
Most people that were involved in one study were intubated because they were in a coma. These people comprise 42% of those involved in the studies we looked at. People in a coma are unlike other critically ill people because they may not benefit to the same extent from having stable blood pressure during endotracheal intubation, which etomidate provides, nor are they at high risk from impaired adrenal gland function compared to other critically ill patients, for example those with severe infection.","# Plain Language Summary: Etomidate and Critically Ill Patients

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether a medicine called etomidate is safe to use in very sick patients who need a breathing tube placed in the emergency room. Doctors use etomidate often because it works quickly and keeps blood pressure stable. However, scientists know it can affect the adrenal glands (small glands that help your body handle stress). Researchers wanted to know if this causes real problems for patients.

## Who was studied?

The review included studies of critically ill patients who needed emergency breathing tubes. These patients had conditions like strokes, heart attacks, severe infections, or severe bleeding.

## What was tested?

Researchers compared patients who received etomidate to patients who received other similar fast-acting medicines for putting in breathing tubes.

## What did they find?

**Death rates:** Etomidate did not clearly increase the chance of death compared to other medicines.

**Adrenal gland function:** Etomidate did affect how the adrenal glands worked, especially in the first few hours after the medicine was given. However, this effect got smaller over time.

**Organ damage:** Etomidate caused a small increase in organ damage risk, but doctors said this increase was too small to matter in real life.

**Hospital stays and breathing support:** Etomidate did not change how long patients stayed in the hospital or intensive care unit, or how long they needed breathing machines.

## Bottom line

Based on current evidence, etomidate appears reasonably safe for emergency use in very sick patients, even though it does affect the adrenal glands temporarily. More research may provide clearer answers.","### Etomidate Use for Emergency Airway Interventions: Plain Language Summary

**Purpose of the Study:**
The study looked at whether using a drug called etomidate for emergency breathing help in very sick people affects their chance of survival.

**Who Was Studied:**
The study focused on critically ill patients needing immediate breathing support due to conditions like trauma or shock.

**What Was Done:**
Researchers looked at different studies comparing a single dose of etomidate to other quick-acting drugs used for emergency airway procedures.

**What Researchers Wanted to Know:**
1. Does etomidate affect survival rates?
2. Does it impact the function of the adrenal gland, which helps control stress responses?
3. Does it change how long patients stay in intensive care or need breathing machines?

**Main Findings:**
- **Survival:** There wasn't strong evidence that etomidate changes survival rates when compared to other drugs.
- **Adrenal Gland Function:** Etomidate might affect adrenal gland function, especially a few hours after it is given, but the overall effect on health isn't clear.
- **Organ Function:** There was a slight increase in the chance of organ issues, but it wasn't very significant.
- **Hospital Stay and Equipment Use:** Etomidate didn't change how long patients stayed in the ICU or used breathing machines or other support.

**Safety and Quality:**
Some studies had issues that could affect results, and more research could change what we know.

**Conclusion:**
Etomidate doesn't seem to change survival chances or hospital resource use much, but it might slightly affect adrenal gland and organ function. It's unclear if this matters for patient health. Further research could provide more answers."
"Background
Traditionally inhaled treatment for asthma has used separate preventer and reliever therapies. The combination of formoterol and budesonide in one inhaler has made possible a single inhaler for both prevention and relief of symptoms (single inhaler therapy or SiT). 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of budesonide and formoterol in a single inhaler for maintenance and reliever therapy in asthma compared with maintenance with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (alone or as part of current best practice) and any reliever therapy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register in February 2013.
Selection criteria
Parallel, randomised controlled trials of 12 weeks or longer in adults and children with chronic asthma. Studies had to assess the combination of formoterol and budesonide as SiT, against a control group that received inhaled steroids and a separate reliever inhaler. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 13 trials involving 13,152 adults and one of the trials also involved 224 children (which have been separately reported). All studies were sponsored by the manufacturer of the SiT inhaler. We considered the nine studies assessing SiT against best practice to be at a low risk of selection bias, but a high risk of detection bias as they were unblinded. 
In adults whose asthma was not well‐controlled on ICS, the reduction in hospital admission with SiT did not reach statistical significance (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.44, eight trials, N = 8841, low quality evidence due to risk of detection bias in open studies and imprecision). The rates of hospital admission were low; for every 1000 people treated with current best practice six would experience a hospital admission over six months compared with between three and eight treated with SiT. The odds of experiencing exacerbations needing treatment with oral steroids were lower with SiT compared with control (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.98, eight trials, N = 8841, moderate quality evidence due to risk of detection bias). For every 100 adults treated with current best practice over six months, seven required a course of oral steroids, whilst for SiT there would be six (95% CI 5 to 7). The small reduction in time to first severe exacerbation needing medical intervention was not statistically significant (hazard ratio (HR) 0.94; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.04, five trials, N = 7355). Most trials demonstrated a reduction in the mean total daily dose of ICS with SiT (mean reduction was based on self‐reported data from patient diaries and ranged from 107 to 385 µg/day). Withdrawals due to adverse events were more common in people treated with SiT in comparison to current best practice (OR 2.85; 95% CI 1.89 to 4.30, moderate quality evidence due to risk of detection bias). 
Three studies including 4209 adults compared SiT with higher dose budesonide maintenance and terbutaline for symptom relief. The studies were considered as low risk of bias. The run‐in for these studies involved withdrawal of LABA, and patients were recruited who were symptomatic during run‐in. The reduction in the odds of hospitalisation with SiT compared with higher dose ICS did not reach statistical significance (Peto OR; 0.56; 95% CI 0.28 to 1.09, moderate quality evidence due to imprecision). Fewer patients on SiT needed a course of oral corticosteroids (OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.64, high quality evidence). For every 100 adults treated with ICS over 11 months, 18 required a course of oral steroids, whilst for SiT there would be 11 (95% CI 9 to 12). Withdrawals due to adverse events were less common in people treated with SiT in comparison to higher dose budesonide maintenance (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.93, high quality evidence). 
One study included children (N = 224), in which SiT was compared with higher dose budesonide. There was a significant reduction in participants who needed an increase in their inhaled steroids with SiT, but there were only two hospitalisations for asthma and no separate data on courses of oral corticosteroids. Less inhaled and oral corticosteroids were used in the SiT group and the annual height gain was also 1 cm greater in the SiT group, (95% CI 0.3 cm to 1.7 cm). 
The results for fatal serious adverse events were too rare to rule out either treatment being harmful. There was no significant difference found in non‐fatal serious adverse events for any of the comparisons. 
Authors' conclusions
Single inhaler therapy has now been demonstrated to reduce exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids against current best practice strategies and against a fixed higher dose of inhaled steroids. The strength of evidence that SiT reduces hospitalisation against these same treatments is weak. There were more discontinuations due to adverse events on SiT compared to current best practice, but no significant differences in serious adverse events. Our confidence in these conclusions is limited by the open‐label design of the trials, and by the unknown adherence to treatment in the current best practice arms of the trials. 
Single inhaler therapy can reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations needing oral corticosteroids in comparison with fixed dose maintenance ICS and separate relief medication. The reduced odds of exacerbations with SiT compared with higher dose ICS should be viewed in the context of the possible impact of LABA withdrawal during study run‐in. This may have made the study populations more likely to respond to SiT. 
Single inhaler therapy is not currently licensed for children under 18 years of age in the United Kingdom and there is currently very little research evidence for this approach in children or adolescents.","In people with asthma are single inhalers that contain both formoterol and budesonide better than current best practice? 
Background to the review  ‘Single inhaler therapy’ means that a single inhaler containing two drugs is used. One of these drugs acts quickly and is called the ""reliever"". The other works much more slowly and is called the ""preventer"". The reliever is a beta‐agonist bronchodilator, which help to open the airways and help people breathe more easily. The preventer is a steroid that controls the underlying inflammation in the lungs, which is caused by the asthma. People on 'single inhaler therapy' (SiT) have one inhaler for use every day to control their underlying inflammation and also for symptom relief. The idea behind SiT is that when people take their inhalers to reduce their shortness of breath or wheezing they will also be getting an increased dose of the steroid preventer. 
We wanted to discover whether using the SiT was better or worse than alternatives, such as receiving two separate inhalers for regular treatment and relief of symptoms.  What did we do?  We reviewed the clinical trials that looked at SiT against inhaled steroids and reliever medication given as two separate inhalers (sometimes called current best practice).  What did we find out?  We found 13 trials on 13,152 adults and one trial also included 224 children, up to February 2013. The trials were all sponsored by the manufacturer of the single inhaler.  When compared with current best practice or higher doses of inhaled steroid, we found that SiT probably reduces the number of flare‐ups that will need treatment with an oral steroid in adults but we are uncertain whether the number of adults admitted to hospital would be reduced. When compared with high doses of inhaled steroids, we found that fewer people experienced a flare‐up that needed treatment with an oral steroid.  The results for death (1 per 1000 people given either treatment), or life threatening problems (just under 50 per 1000 people given either treatment), were too imprecise to enable us to rule out either treatment being more harmful than the other. More adults left the trial early because they experienced adverse effects in the group taking single inhalers. There was only one small trial in children, so we are unable to make any firm conclusions in children.  The studies were generally well‐designed, although in the studies which compared SiT against current best practice people knew which treatment they were getting, and this could have affected the reliability of the results. The studies comparing SiT against inhaled steroids were designed differently and were more reliable. Overall, we think that more evidence from future trials might change the strength of the conclusions for the question of whether SiT is better than current best practice. We believe that there is good quality evidence that SiT is more effective than high dose inhaled steroids, although the studies recruited people who were likely to respond.","# Plain Language Summary: Single Inhaler Therapy for Asthma

## What is this study about?

This review looked at a new way to treat asthma using one inhaler that contains two medicines (budesonide and formoterol). This inhaler can be used both to prevent asthma symptoms and to relieve them when they happen. The researchers wanted to see if this approach works better and is as safe as the traditional method, which uses separate inhalers for prevention and relief.

## Who was studied?

The review included 13 studies with 13,152 adults and 224 children who have asthma. All studies lasted at least 12 weeks.

## What did they test?

Researchers compared the single inhaler approach to the traditional method of using:
- A preventer inhaler (steroid inhaler used daily)
- A separate reliever inhaler (used when needed)

## Main findings

**Good news:**
- The single inhaler reduced the number of times people needed oral steroid pills to treat asthma flare-ups
- People using the single inhaler needed less steroid medicine overall
- In children, growth was slightly better with the single inhaler

**Mixed results:**
- The single inhaler did not clearly reduce hospital visits
- More people stopped using the single inhaler due to side effects compared to traditional treatment

**Safety:**
- No serious safety concerns were found
- Both approaches were generally safe

## Important notes

- All studies were sponsored by the medicine company that makes the single inhaler
- The single inhaler is not currently approved for children under 18 in the United Kingdom
- More research in children is needed","### Plain Language Summary

**Purpose of Study:**
This study looked at using one inhaler with two medicines, formoterol and budesonide, to help people with asthma. The goal was to see how well this inhaler works and if it's safe compared to other treatments.

**Who Was Involved:**
The study included many trials with over 13,000 adults and some children, who all had asthma.

**What Was Tested:**
The study tested a single inhaler (SiT) that combines formoterol and budesonide against using separate inhalers—one for daily prevention and another for quick relief.

**Key Findings:**
- The single inhaler helped reduce the need for oral steroids in some adults.
- Fewer people using the single inhaler needed to go to the hospital, but this finding wasn’t statistically strong.
- People using the single inhaler reported fewer asthma flare-ups.
- There was less need for higher doses of inhaled medicine with the single inhaler.
- Some people stopped using the single inhaler due to side effects.

**For Children:**
One study with children showed that the single inhaler helped them use less medicine, and they grew slightly taller over a year, but there wasn’t a lot of data.

**Safety:**
The study found no major differences in serious side effects between the different treatments.

**Conclusions:**
The single inhaler may help reduce asthma flare-ups needing extra medicine, but more research is needed, especially for children. In the UK, this inhaler isn't approved for kids under 18."
"Background
The recommended management for neonates with a possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) is hospitalisation and treatment with intravenous antibiotics, such as ampicillin plus gentamicin. However, hospitalisation is often not feasible for neonates in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). Therefore, alternative options for the management of neonatal PSBI in LMICs needs to be evaluated. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of community‐based antibiotics for neonatal PSBI in LMICs on neonatal mortality and to assess whether the effects of community‐based antibiotics for neonatal PSBI differ according to the antibiotic regimen administered. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 3), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 16 April 2018), Embase (1980 to 16 April 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 16 April 2018). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised, quasi‐randomised and cluster‐randomised trials. For the first comparison, we included trials that compared antibiotics which were initiated and completed in the community to the standard hospital referral for neonatal PSBI in LMICs. For the second comparison, we included trials that compared simplified antibiotic regimens which relied more on oral antibiotics than intravenous antibiotics to the standard regimen of seven to 10 days of injectable penicillin/ampicillin with an injectable aminoglycoside delivered in the community to treat neonatal PSBI. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Group. The primary outcomes were all‐cause neonatal mortality and sepsis‐specific neonatal mortality. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
For the first comparison, five studies met the inclusion criteria. Community‐based antibiotic delivery for neonatal PSBI reduced neonatal mortality when compared to hospital referral only (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 0.99; 5 studies, n = 125,134; low‐quality evidence). There was, however, a high level of statistical heterogeneity (I² = 87%) likely, due to the heterogenous nature of the study settings as well as the fact that four of the studies provided various co‐interventions in conjunction with community‐based antibiotics. Community‐based antibiotic delivery for neonatal PSBI showed a possible effect on reducing sepsis‐specific neonatal mortality (typical RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.00; 2 studies, n = 40,233; low‐quality evidence). 
For the second comparison, five studies met the inclusion criteria. Using a simplified antibiotic approach resulted in similar rates of neonatal mortality when compared to the standard regimen of seven days of injectable procaine benzylpenicillin and injectable procaine benzylpenicillin and injectable gentamicin delivered in community‐settings for neonatal PSBI (typical RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.50; 3 studies, n = 3476; moderate‐quality evidence). In subgroup analysis, the simplified antibiotic regimen of seven days of oral amoxicillin and injectable gentamicin showed no difference in neonatal mortality (typical RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.51; 3 studies, n = 2001; moderate‐quality evidence). Two days of injectable benzylpenicillin and injectable gentamicin followed by five days of oral amoxicillin showed no difference in neonatal mortality (typical RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.65; 3 studies, n = 2036; low‐quality evidence). Two days of injectable gentamicin and oral amoxicillin followed by five days of oral amoxicillin showed no difference in neonatal mortality (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.85; 1 study, n = 893; moderate‐quality evidence). For fast breathing alone, seven days of oral amoxicillin resulted in no difference in neonatal mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.91; 1 study, n = 1406; low‐quality evidence). None of the studies in the second comparison reported the effect of a simplified antibiotic regimen on sepsis‐specific neonatal mortality. 
Authors' conclusions
Low‐quality data demonstrated that community‐based antibiotics reduced neonatal mortality when compared to the standard hospital referral for neonatal PSBI in resource‐limited settings. The use of co‐interventions, however, prevent disentanglement of the contribution from community‐based antibiotics. Moderate‐quality evidence showed that simplified, community‐based treatment of PSBI using regimens which rely on the combination of oral and injectable antibiotics did not result in increased neonatal mortality when compared to the standard treatment of using only injectable antibiotics. Overall, the evidence suggests that simplified, community‐based antibiotics may be efficacious to treat neonatal PSBI when hospitalisation is not feasible. However, implementation research is recommended to study the effectiveness and scale‐up of simplified, community‐based antibiotics in resource‐limited settings.","Antibiotics delivered in the home or clinic for newborns with suspected, serious infections in low‐ and middle‐income countries 
Review question 
In low‐ and middle‐income countries, are antibiotics delivered in the home or clinic an effective method for treating newborns with suspected, serious bacterial infections? 
Background 
Given their fragility, newborns with a suspected, serious bacterial infection are advised to be admitted to a hospital and receive intravenous antibiotics. However, hospital admission is often not possible for families who live in countries with limited resources. Therefore, alternative methods of delivering antibiotics to sick newborns have been studied. Treating a newborn outside of the hospital relies on a community health worker with limited, but targeted training, to diagnose the infection, dispense medication, and follow‐up the newborn's response, either at home or in a clinic. Also, antibiotics may be provided orally so that parents can administer at home, but oral antibiotics may be less potent than intravenous antibiotics. 
Study characteristics 
We searched medical databases and found two types of studies that addressed our review question. One group of five trials studied communities in which sick newborns were offered antibiotics in the home or ambulatory clinics and compared them to communities in which sick newborns received only the standard referral to a hospital. The second group of five trials treated sick newborns in the home or clinic with either the intravenous antibiotics that are typically administered in the hospital or with simpler antibiotic regimens that relied more on oral antibiotics. The trials were conducted in a variety of countries within sub‐Saharan Africa and South Asia. The evidence is up to date as of 16 April 2018. 
Key results 
There is reduced risk of newborn death when sick newborns are given antibiotics in the home or clinic compared to sick newborns who are only referred to a hospital, but this result is based on low‐quality evidence. In addition, the majority of the studies that examined home‐ or clinic‐based antibiotics included other interventions, such as improved care at birth, that may have influenced the findings. 
Moderate‐quality evidence showed that antibiotic regimens that involve fewer injections and can be administered in the home or clinic do not result in more newborn deaths when compared to the typically administered antibiotic regimens that rely solely on injections. Based on this result, simpler antibiotic regimens delivered in the home or clinic may be considered as an alternative treatment for sick newborns that cannot access a hospital. However, it is important to remember that the studies were conducted under ideal conditions with a high level of patient monitoring. Additional research in real‐world settings with limited resources are recommended to determine if the results hold true. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of evidence ranged from low to moderate quality.","# Plain Language Summary: Community-Based Antibiotics for Newborn Infections in Low-Resource Countries

## What is this study about?

This study looked at whether giving antibiotics in the community (rather than in a hospital) could help newborns with serious bacterial infections in countries with limited resources.

## Why does this matter?

In many low- and middle-income countries, hospitals are far away or too expensive for families to reach. Newborns with serious infections normally need to stay in a hospital and receive antibiotics through an IV (needle in the vein). Researchers wanted to know if antibiotics given at home or in the community could work just as well and save more babies' lives.

## What did researchers do?

The researchers looked at 10 different studies that tested two main ideas:

1. **Giving antibiotics in the community vs. sending babies to the hospital** (5 studies with about 125,000 babies)
2. **Using simpler antibiotic treatments (mixing pills and shots) vs. only using shots** (5 studies with about 3,500 babies)

## What did they find?

**Community antibiotics vs. hospital care:**
- Babies who received antibiotics in their community had a slightly better chance of survival than babies sent to the hospital
- The difference was small but real

**Simpler antibiotic treatments:**
- Using a mix of pills and shots worked about as well as using only shots
- Babies survived at similar rates with both approaches

## What does this mean?

When hospitals aren't available, giving antibiotics in the community appears to be a reasonable option. Simpler treatments using both pills and injections seem safe and effective. However, researchers say more real-world testing is needed before widely using these approaches.","### Plain Language Summary

Babies with serious bacterial infections often need to be in the hospital to get special medicine through a vein, called antibiotics. In some countries, this isn't always possible. So, researchers wanted to see if giving these antibiotics at home in the community could help these babies.

#### What Was the Study About?

The study looked at how well antibiotics worked when given to sick newborns at home rather than in a hospital. It focused on babies in countries where getting to a hospital can be difficult.

#### What Did They Find?

1. **Babies' Health**: Giving antibiotics at home helped reduce deaths in newborns compared to sending them to the hospital, but there were different results depending on the community settings and other factors.

2. **Types of Treatment**: The researchers tested different ways to give these medicines. Some babies got simpler treatments with pills and fewer shots. These simpler treatments seemed to work just as well as the usual treatment with only shots.

3. **Safety and Quality**: The study found that these home treatments were safe for the babies.

#### Conclusion

This research suggests that giving antibiotics at home could be a good choice for treating sick newborns in places where hospitals are hard to reach. The results show promise, but more studies are needed to make sure this can be done successfully on a larger scale."
"Background
Increasingly, cancer is recognised as a chronic condition with a growing population of informal caregivers providing care for cancer patients. Informal caregiving can negatively affect the health and well‐being of caregivers. We need a synthesised account of best evidence to aid decision‐making about effective ways to support caregivers for individuals 'living with cancer'. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions designed to improve the quality of life (QoL), physical health and well‐being of informal caregivers of people living with cancer compared with usual care. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, ProQuest, Open SIGLE, Web of Science from inception up to January 2018, trial registries and citation lists of included studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing psychosocial interventions delivered to adult informal caregivers of adults affected by cancer on a group or individual basis with usual care. Psychosocial interventions included non‐pharmacological interventions that involved an interpersonal relationship between caregivers and healthcare professionals. We included interventions delivered also to caregiver‐patient dyads. Interventions delivered to caregivers of individuals receiving palliative or inpatient care were excluded. Our primary outcome was caregiver QoL. Secondary outcomes included patient QoL, caregiver and patient depression, anxiety, psychological distress, physical health status and intervention satisfaction and adverse effects. 
Data collection and analysis
Pairs of review authors independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data and conducted 'Risk of bias' assessments. We synthesised findings using meta‐analysis, where possible, and reported remaining results in a narrative synthesis. 
Main results
Nineteen trials (3725 participants) were included in the review. All trials were reported in English and were undertaken in high‐income countries. Trials targeted caregivers of patients affected by a number of cancers spanning newly diagnosed patients, patients awaiting treatment, patients who were being treated currently and individuals post‐treatment. Most trials delivered interventions to caregiver‐patient dyads (predominantly spousal dyads) and there was variation in intervention delivery to groups or individual participants. There was much heterogeneity across interventions though the majority were defined as psycho‐educational. All trials were rated as being at 'high risk of bias'. 
Compared to usual care, psychosocial interventions may improve slightly caregiver QoL immediately post intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.53; two studies, 265 participants) and may have little to no effect on caregiver QoL at 12 months (SMD 0.14, 95% CI ‐ 0.11 to 0.40; two studies, 239 participants) post‐intervention (both low‐quality evidence). 
Psychosocial interventions probably have little to no effect on caregiver depression immediately to one‐month post‐intervention (SMD 0.01, 95% CI ‐0.14 to 0.15; nine studies, 702 participants) (moderate‐quality evidence). Psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on caregiver anxiety immediately post‐intervention (SMD ‐0.12, 95 % CI ‐0.33 to 0.10; five studies, 329 participants), depression three‐to‐six months (SMD 0.03, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.38; five studies, 379 participants) post‐intervention and patient QoL six to 12 months (SMD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.37 to 0.26; three studies, 294 participants) post‐intervention (all low‐quality evidence). There was uncertainty whether psychosocial interventions improve patient QoL immediately (SMD ‐0.03, 95 %CI ‐0.50 to 0.44; two studies, 292 participants) or caregiver anxiety three‐to‐six months (SMD‐0.25, 95% CI ‐0.64 to 0.13; four studies, 272 participants) post‐intervention (both very low‐quality evidence). Two studies which could not be pooled in a meta‐analysis for caregiver physical health status found little to no effect immediately post‐intervention and a small intervention effect 12 months post‐intervention. Caregiver or patient satisfaction or cost‐effectiveness of interventions were not assessed in any studies. Interventions demonstrated good feasibility and acceptability. 
Psychosocial interventions probably have little to no effect on patient physical health status immediately post‐intervention (SMD 0.17, 95 % CI ‐0.07 to 0.41; four studies, 461 participants) and patient depression three to six months post‐intervention (SMD‐0.11, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.12; six studies, 534 participants) (both moderate‐quality evidence). 
Psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on caregiver psychological distress immediately to one‐month (SMD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.42 to 0.26; three studies, 134 participants), and seven to 12 months (SMD 0.08, 95% CI ‐0.42 to 0.58; two studies, 62 participants) post‐intervention; patient depression immediately (SMD ‐0.12, 95% CI ‐0.31 to 0.07; nine studies, 852 participants); anxiety immediately (SMD ‐0.13, 95% CI ‐0.41 to 0.15; four studies, 422 participants), and three to six months (SMD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.45 to 0.02; four studies, 370 participants); psychological distress immediately (SMD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.47 to 0.44; two studies, 74 participants) and seven to 12 months (SMD ‐0.27, 95% CI ‐0.78 to 0.24; two studies, 61 participants); and physical health status six to 12 months (SMD 0.06, 95% CI ‐0.18 to 0.30; two studies, 275 participants) post‐intervention (all low‐quality evidence). 
Three trials reported adverse effects associated with the interventions, compared with usual care, including higher distress, sexual function‐related distress and lower relationship satisfaction levels for caregivers, higher distress levels for patients, and that some content was perceived as insensitive to some participants. 
Trials not able to be pooled in a meta‐analysis did not tend to report effect size and it was difficult to discern intervention effectiveness. Variable intervention effects were reported for patient and caregiver outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
Heterogeneity across studies makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for this population. There is an immediate need for rigorous trials with process evaluations and clearer, detailed intervention descriptions. Cost‐effectiveness studies should be conducted alongside future trials.","Psychosocial support for informal caregivers of people living with cancer
Background 
Increasingly, people who are not health professionals provide care for a partner, family member or friend affected by cancer, which can have negative effects on their health and well‐being. Psychosocial interventions that comprise psychological or social support and involve direct interaction between a healthcare professional and caregivers (or caregiver‐patient pairs) may help to address the negative health effects for caregivers. 
Review question 
What is the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions compared to usual care for informal caregivers of people living with cancer on a range of outcomes related to health and well‐being? 
Results 
We found19 trials that compared psychosocial interventions with usual care, in studies that included almost four thousand participants. Studies included caregivers of people affected by different cancers across all stages of the disease. There were differences in intervention make‐up. Intervention examples include providing information and/or teaching caregivers (or caregiver‐patient pairs) coping, communication or problem‐solving skills to manage symptoms or improve relationships. Interventions were delivered by nurses, psychologists or other professionals on an outpatient basis or at home via telephone. 
There may be a minimal benefit for caregiver quality‐of‐life immediately after the intervention, but this may not last. Psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on quality of life for patients six to 12 months post‐intervention, but we are uncertain whether or not interventions improve quality of life for patients immediately post‐intervention. 
Psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on caregiver depression, anxiety, distress and physical health and patient anxiety and distress at any time after the intervention, or on patient depression immediately and patient physical health six to 12 months post‐intervention. Psychosocial interventions probably have little to no effect on patient physical health immediately post‐intervention or patient depression three to six months post‐intervention. 
Three studies reported adverse effects including increased distress and sexual function‐related distress and lower relationship satisfaction levels for carers, increased distress levels for patients, and intervention content that was seen as inappropriate for some participants. No studies looked at cost‐effectiveness or intervention satisfaction for caregivers or patients. Because the quality of evidence was low generally, findings must be treated with caution. 
Conclusion 
Psychosocial interventions do not impact to a clinically meaningful degree outcomes for caregivers irrespective of patient cancer stage or type. Perhaps, other outcomes (e.g. relationship quality) or other psychosocial interventions (e.g. meditation) may be more helpful for caregivers. Interventions should be subjected to better conducted trials. Intervention development should involve caregivers and pay particular attention to individual personal needs.","# Plain Language Summary: Support Programs for Cancer Caregivers

## What is this study about?

More and more people are caring for family members or loved ones who have cancer. This caring work can be hard on the caregivers' health and feelings. Researchers wanted to find out if special support programs help caregivers feel better.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at 19 different studies that tested support programs for cancer caregivers. These programs were compared to regular care (no special program). The studies included 3,725 people total and were done in wealthy countries.

## Who was in the studies?

The studies included adult caregivers (mostly spouses) of adults with cancer. Some patients were newly diagnosed, some were getting treatment, and some had finished treatment. The studies did NOT include caregivers of people in hospice care or in the hospital.

## What kinds of support programs were tested?

Most programs taught caregivers about cancer and how to cope with stress. Some programs worked with both the caregiver and patient together. Programs were delivered one-on-one or in groups.

## What were the main findings?

**The good news:**
- Support programs were easy for people to use and people liked them
- Programs may have helped caregivers feel slightly better right after the program ended
- Programs seemed safe overall

**The not-so-good news:**
- The improvements were small
- By 12 months later, the benefits mostly went away
- Programs did not seem to help much with depression, worry, or stress for caregivers or patients
- A few people reported feeling more upset or having relationship problems after the program

## What does this mean?

We don't have strong proof that these support programs work well for cancer caregivers. Better-designed studies are needed to find out what really helps.","### Summary of the Study

**Purpose:**  
This study looked at whether special programs (called psychosocial interventions) can help people who take care of family members with cancer. It aimed to see if these programs improve caregivers' quality of life, health, and overall well-being compared to regular care.

**Who Participated:**  
The study included adult caregivers of adults with cancer. Most of the study involved caregivers working together with the cancer patients they were helping, often family members like spouses.

**What Was Studied:**  
The researchers checked many sources to gather information from past studies. They focused on non-medical interventions that involved caregivers working with healthcare professionals. These programs didn't involve caregivers of patients in hospice or hospital care.

**Main Findings:**  
- **Quality of Life**: The programs might slightly improve caregivers' quality of life right after they finish. However, there's little to no long-term effect after a year.
- **Depression and Anxiety**: These programs likely have little to no impact on reducing depression and anxiety in caregivers shortly after they finish. There's also uncertainty about their impact on patients' quality of life and mental health.
- **Physical Health**: There was little to no effect on caregivers' or patients' physical health immediately after the programs.
- **Program Satisfaction**: The programs were generally well-received and seemed doable, although some had negative effects like increased stress or relationship issues. 

**Conclusion:**  
It's hard to make strong claims about the effectiveness of these programs for caregivers of cancer patients. More comprehensive studies are needed to better understand their benefits and costs."
"Background
Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) is used to keep the ductus arteriosus patent and can be life‐saving in neonates with ductal‐dependent cardiac lesions. PGE1 is used to promote mixing of pulmonary and systemic blood flow or improve pulmonary or systemic circulations, prior to balloon atrial septostomy or surgery. PGE1 therapy may cause several short‐term and long‐term adverse effects. The efficacy and safety of PGE1 in neonates with ductal‐dependent cardiac lesions has not been systematically reviewed. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy and safety of both short‐term (< 120 hours) and long‐term (≥120 hours) PGE1 therapy in maintaining patency of the ductus arteriosus and decreasing mortality in ductal‐dependent cardiac lesions. 
Search methods
We searched the literature in October 2017, using the search strategy recommended by Cochrane Neonatal. We searched electronic databases (CENTRAL (in the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase); abstracts of the Pediatric Academic Societies; websites for registered trials at www.clinicaltrials.gov and www.controlled‐trials.com; and in the reference list of identified articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomized or quasi‐randomized trials using PGE1 at any dose or duration to maintain ductal patency in term or late preterm (≥ 34 weeks' gestation) infants with ductal‐dependent cardiac lesions and which reported effectiveness and safety in the short term or long term. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed the standard Cochrane methods for conducting a systematic review. Two review authors (SA and MP) independently assessed the titles and abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy to determine eligibility for inclusion. We obtained the full‐text version if eligibility could not be done reliably by title and abstract. We resolved any differences by discussion. We designed electronic forms for trial inclusion/exclusion, data extraction, and for requesting additional published information from authors of the original reports. 
Main results
Our search did not identify any completed or ongoing trials that met our inclusion criteria. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials to determine the safety and efficacy of PGE1 in neonates with ductal‐dependent cardiac lesions. Evidence from observational trials have informed clinical practice on the use of PGE, which is now considered the standard of care for ductal‐dependent cardiac lesions. It is unlikely that randomized controlled studies will be performed for this indication but comparative efficacy of newer formulations of PGE1, different doses of PGE1 and studies comparing PGE with PDA stents or other measures to keep the ductus open may be ethical and necessary.","Prostaglandin E1 for keeping the duct open in heart conditions in the newborn
Review question: 
Is keeping the ductus arteriosus open with prostaglandin E1 effective and safe in babies with heart conditions that need an open ductus arteriosus for survival? 
Background 
Ductus arteriosus is a blood vessel connection between the large blood vessel supplying blood to the lungs (pulmonary artery) and to the large blood vessel supplying blood to the body (aorta). Normally the ductus is open before birth and closes within the first day after birth. However, certain heart conditions where there is a block to the blood flow to the lungs or the body, or a condition where the blood vessels supplying the lungs and body are switched (transposition of great arteries), an open ductus is necessary for survival. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) is a substance produced by the ductus that keeps it open. External PGE1 is used to keep the ductus arteriosus open in neonates who have heart lesions that depend on an open ductus for survival. PGE1, though lifesaving, is not without risks. There are no systematic reviews to assess PGE1's effectiveness or safety. 
Study characteristics: 
We searched the literature for studies that used chance selection (randomization) that used PGE1 in neonates born at greater than 34 weeks of gestation to keep the ductus arteriosus open in newborn heart conditions and which reported on effectiveness and safety. 
Key results: 
We found no ongoing or completed randomized studies to include in this review. Currently there is no evidence from randomized trials on prostaglandin (PGE1) but information from non‐randomized studies is available. Use of PGE1 in heart lesions, where the ductus arteriosus needs to stay open, is considered standard of care, and it would be perceived as unethical to do randomized studies. 
Quality of evidence: 
The quality of evidence could not be assessed as we found no randomized studies for inclusion in this review.","# Plain Language Summary: PGE1 Treatment for Newborns with Heart Conditions

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether a medicine called PGE1 is safe and works well for newborns with certain heart problems. These heart problems require a special blood vessel (called the ductus arteriosus) to stay open so blood can flow properly to the lungs and body.

## Why is this important?

PGE1 is currently used to keep this blood vessel open in newborns with these heart conditions. Doctors believe it can be lifesaving. However, researchers wanted to find out if there was solid evidence that it actually works and is safe.

## What did the researchers do?

The research team searched for studies that tested PGE1 in newborns (babies born at 34 weeks or later) with these heart problems. They looked for studies that compared PGE1 to other treatments or no treatment. They searched medical databases and trial registries through October 2017.

## What did they find?

The researchers did not find any completed or ongoing studies that met their requirements for this review.

## What does this mean?

There is not enough evidence from rigorous studies to prove whether PGE1 is safe and effective. However, doctors currently use PGE1 as standard treatment because observational studies (which watch what happens but don't compare treatments) suggest it helps. Future studies comparing PGE1 to newer treatments might be helpful and appropriate.","### Plain Language Summary

**Purpose of the Study**

This study looked at how safe and effective a medicine called Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) is for newborn babies with certain heart problems. The medicine helps keep a part of the heart open, which can be very important before the baby gets other treatments or surgery.

**Who Was Studied**

The study focused on newborns who were either full-term or born slightly early (at least 34 weeks into the pregnancy) and had heart issues that needed this medicine to keep them stable.

**What Was Tested**

Researchers wanted to see if using PGE1 for both short times (less than 5 days) and longer times (5 days or more) was safe and helped keep the heart passage open.

**How the Study was Done**

The team looked through a lot of past research and studies to find the information they needed. They searched websites, journals, and online libraries to gather data.

**Results**

Despite a thorough search, no studies were found that exactly met the criteria needed for this review. This means there's not enough high-quality research to know for sure how safe or effective PGE1 is based on randomized trials.

**Conclusion**

Because there's not enough trial-based evidence, doctors currently rely on other types of studies to use this medicine. PGE1 is a common treatment now for these heart conditions. Future research could look at new forms of the medicine or compare it with other treatments.

**Why This Matters**

Understanding whether PGE1 is safe and effective helps doctors make better choices for treating babies with serious heart problems. Continued research could improve care for these little patients."
"Background
Tailored intervention strategies are frequently recommended among approaches to the implementation of improvement in health professional performance. Attempts to change the behaviour of health professionals may be impeded by a variety of different barriers, obstacles, or factors (which we collectively refer to as determinants of practice). Change may be more likely if implementation strategies are specifically chosen to address these determinants. 
Objectives
To determine whether tailored intervention strategies are effective in improving professional practice and healthcare outcomes. We compared interventions tailored to address the identified determinants of practice with either no intervention or interventions not tailored to the determinants. 
Search methods
We conducted searches of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, and the British Nursing Index to May 2014. We conducted a final search in December 2014 (in MEDLINE only) for more recently published trials. We conducted searches of the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) in March 2013. We also handsearched two journals. 
Selection criteria
Cluster‐randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions tailored to address prospectively identified determinants of practice, which reported objectively measured professional practice or healthcare outcomes, and where at least one group received an intervention designed to address prospectively identified determinants of practice. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed quality and extracted data. We undertook qualitative and quantitative analyses, the quantitative analysis including two elements: we carried out 1) meta‐regression analyses to compare interventions tailored to address identified determinants with either no interventions or an intervention(s) not tailored to the determinants, and 2) heterogeneity analyses to investigate sources of differences in the effectiveness of interventions. These included the effects of: risk of bias, use of a theory when developing the intervention, whether adjustment was made for local factors, and number of domains addressed with the determinants identified. 
Main results
We added nine studies to this review to bring the total number of included studies to 32 comparing an intervention tailored to address identified determinants of practice to no intervention or an intervention(s) not tailored to the determinants. The outcome was implementation of recommended practice, e.g. clinical practice guideline recommendations. Fifteen studies provided enough data to be included in the quantitative analysis. The pooled odds ratio was 1.56 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 1.93, P value < 0.001). The 17 studies not included in the meta‐analysis had findings showing variable effectiveness consistent with the findings of the meta‐regression. 
Authors' conclusions
Despite the increase in the number of new studies identified, our overall finding is similar to that of the previous review. Tailored implementation can be effective, but the effect is variable and tends to be small to moderate. The number of studies remains small and more research is needed, including trials comparing tailored interventions to no or other interventions, but also studies to develop and investigate the components of tailoring (identification of the most important determinants, selecting interventions to address the determinants). Currently available studies have used different methods to identify determinants of practice and different approaches to selecting interventions to address the determinants. It is not yet clear how best to tailor interventions and therefore not clear what the effect of an optimally tailored intervention would be.","Tailored interventions to address identified determinants of practice
Tailored interventions to change professional practice are interventions planned following an investigation into the factors that explain current professional practice and any reasons for resisting new practice. These factors are referred to using various terms, including barriers, enablers, obstacles, and facilitators; in this review we use the term determinants of practice to include all such factors. The determinants may vary in different healthcare settings, groups of healthcare professionals, or clinical tasks. It is widely assumed that efforts to change professional practice have a lower likelihood of success unless these determinants are identified and taken into account. 
In a previous review, we included 26 studies and we concluded that tailoring can change professional practice. However, more studies of tailoring have been published and therefore we have incorporated the new studies into an update of the review. 
We have included 32 studies in the new review. The findings continue to indicate that tailored interventions can change professional practice, although they are not always effective and, when they are, the effect is small to moderate. There is insufficient evidence on the most effective approaches to tailoring, including how determinants should be identified, how decisions should be made on which determinants are most important to address, and how interventions should be selected to account for the important determinants. In addition, there is no evidence about the cost‐effectiveness of tailored interventions compared to other interventions to change professional practice. Therefore, future research studies should seek to develop and evaluate more systematic approaches to tailoring.","# Plain Language Summary: Do Tailored Strategies Help Doctors and Nurses Follow Best Practices?

## What is this study about?

Researchers wanted to know if customized training and support programs help doctors and nurses follow recommended medical practices better than regular training or no training at all.

## Why does this matter?

Doctors and nurses sometimes don't follow the best medical practices. There are often reasons why—like lack of time, unclear guidelines, or not having the right tools. This study looked at whether creating custom programs that fix these specific problems works better than one-size-fits-all approaches.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at 32 previous studies that tested this idea. In these studies, some healthcare workers got customized training designed to fix their specific problems, while others got regular training or no training. Researchers then checked whether the healthcare workers actually followed the recommended practices.

## What did they find?

**The main result:** Customized programs helped—but the improvement was small to moderate. Healthcare workers who got tailored training were about 1.5 times more likely to follow best practices than those who didn't.

However, results varied quite a bit between studies. Some customized programs worked better than others.

## What does this mean?

Tailored training programs can help, but they don't always work the same way. Researchers still need to figure out the best way to create these custom programs and which problems are most important to fix.

## Timeline

This review looked at studies published through December 2014.","### Plain Language Summary

#### What was the study about?

This study looked at ways to help healthcare workers improve their job performance and patient care. Researchers wanted to know if special plans, called tailored interventions, which are designed to tackle specific problems, are more effective than plans that aren't personalized or having no plan at all.

#### Who was studied?

The study looked at different groups of healthcare workers who received various types of intervention strategies.

#### What did the researchers do?

Researchers searched many scientific databases and reviewed a total of 32 studies done up to December 2014. They focused on studies where specific problems were identified and tailored plans were created to address these issues. The researchers compared the results of these tailored plans with those from either no plan or non-tailored plans.

#### What were the outcomes?

The main goal was to see if these tailored plans helped healthcare workers follow recommended guidelines more effectively.

#### What did the study find?

The study found that tailored plans can help improve healthcare workers' performance. However, the effect was usually small to moderate, and not consistent across all studies. The pooled data showed a positive effect, but more research is needed to understand how to make these tailored plans as effective as possible.

#### How safe were the interventions?

The focus was on how well the strategies worked, not on safety issues, so no specific safety concerns were detailed in this study.

#### What needs more study?

Researchers believe more studies are needed to figure out the best way to create these tailored plans, including finding out which problems to focus on and which strategies work best."
"Background
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends undertaking 150 minutes of moderate‐intensity physical activity per week, but most people do not. Workplaces present opportunities to influence behaviour and encourage physical activity, as well as other aspects of a healthy lifestyle. A pedometer is an inexpensive device that encourages physical activity by providing feedback on daily steps, although pedometers are now being largely replaced by more sophisticated devices such as accelerometers and Smartphone apps. For this reason, this is the final update of this review. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of pedometer interventions in the workplace for increasing physical activity and improving long‐term health outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) UPDATE, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from the earliest record to December 2016. We also consulted the reference lists of included studies and contacted study authors to identify additional records. We updated this search in May 2019, but these results have not yet been incorporated. One more study, previously identified as an ongoing study, was placed in 'Studies awaiting classification'. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of workplace interventions with a pedometer component for employed adults, compared to no or minimal interventions, or to alternative physical activity interventions. We excluded athletes and interventions using accelerometers. The primary outcome was physical activity. Studies were excluded if physical activity was not measured. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. When studies presented more than one physical activity measure, we used a pre‐specified list of preferred measures to select one measure and up to three time points for analysis. When possible, follow‐up measures were taken after completion of the intervention to identify lasting effects once the intervention had ceased. Given the diversity of measures found, we used ratios of means (RoMs) as standardised effect measures for physical activity. 
Main results
We included 14 studies, recruiting a total of 4762 participants. These studies were conducted in various high‐income countries and in diverse workplaces (from offices to physical workplaces). Participants included both healthy populations and those at risk of chronic disease (e.g. through inactivity or overweight), with a mean age of 41 years. All studies used multi‐component health promotion interventions. Eleven studies used minimal intervention controls, and four used alternative physical activity interventions. Intervention duration ranged from one week to two years, and follow‐up after completion of the intervention ranged from three to ten months. 
Most studies and outcomes were rated at overall unclear or high risk of bias, and only one study was rated at low risk of bias. The most frequent concerns were absence of blinding and high rates of attrition. 
When pedometer interventions are compared to minimal interventions at follow‐up points at least one month after completion of the intervention, pedometers may have no effect on physical activity (6 studies; very low‐certainty evidence; no meta‐analysis due to very high heterogeneity), but the effect is very uncertain. Pedometers may have effects on sedentary behaviour and on quality of life (mental health component), but these effects were very uncertain (1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Pedometer interventions may slightly reduce anthropometry (body mass index (BMI) ‐0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.45 to 0.18; 3 studies; low‐certainty evidence). Pedometer interventions probably had little to no effect on blood pressure (systolic: ‐0.08 mmHg, 95% CI ‐3.26 to 3.11; 2 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence) and may have reduced adverse effects (such as injuries; from 24 to 10 per 100 people in populations experiencing relatively frequent events; odds ratio (OR) 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.84; low‐certainty evidence). No studies compared biochemical measures or disease risk scores at follow‐up after completion of the intervention versus a minimal intervention. 
Comparison of pedometer interventions to alternative physical activity interventions at follow‐up points at least one month after completion of the intervention revealed that pedometers may have an effect on physical activity, but the effect is very uncertain (1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). Sedentary behaviour, anthropometry (BMI or waist circumference), blood pressure (systolic or diastolic), biochemistry (low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, or triglycerides), disease risk scores, quality of life (mental or physical health components), and adverse effects at follow‐up after completion of the intervention were not compared to an alternative physical activity intervention. 
Some positive effects were observed immediately at completion of the intervention periods, but these effects were not consistent, and overall certainty of evidence was insufficient to assess the effectiveness of workplace pedometer interventions. 
Authors' conclusions
Exercise interventions can have positive effects on employee physical activity and health, although current evidence is insufficient to suggest that a pedometer‐based intervention would be more effective than other options. It is important to note that over the past decade, technological advancement in accelerometers as commercial products, often freely available in Smartphones, has in many ways rendered the use of pedometers outdated. Future studies aiming to test the impact of either pedometers or accelerometers would likely find any control arm highly contaminated. Decision‐makers considering allocating resources to large‐scale programmes of this kind should be cautious about the expected benefits of incorporating a pedometer and should note that these effects may not be sustained over the longer term. 
Future studies should be designed to identify the effective components of multi‐component interventions, although pedometers may not be given the highest priority (especially considering the increased availability of accelerometers). Approaches to increase the sustainability of intervention effects and behaviours over a longer term should be considered, as should more consistent measures of physical activity and health outcomes.","Do health promotion programmes in the workplace increase people's physical activity if they include a pedometer? 
Key messages 
Overall, there is not enough evidence to show whether workplace health promotion programmes involving a pedometer affect people's physical activity, especially in the long term. 
What is a pedometer? 
A pedometer is a small, portable electronic device that counts the number of steps a person takes, but unlike an accelerometer, there is no record of intensity. Pedometers aim to encourage people to increase their physical activity by giving them feedback on their daily steps. 
Why we did this review 
Most people do not do enough physical activity. According to the World Health Organization, doing at least 30 minutes of moderately intense physical activity on most days can reduce a person's risk of developing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and some cancers. We wanted to find out if workplace health promotion programmes that involve wearing pedometers would motivate people to increase their physical activity. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies of workplace programmes that used pedometers to promote health in employees. We looked for randomised controlled studies, where the treatment each person receives is decided randomly. 
Search date: We included evidence published up to December 2016. 
What we found 
We found 14 studies including 4762 people in different workplaces, ranging from offices to construction sites, mostly in high‐income countries. In all studies, pedometers were part of a health programme that included other components, such as walking groups, counselling, or dietary advice. Studies compared the effects of participating in pedometer programmes with: 
‐ receiving no or a minimal health programme such as regular advice about the benefits of physical activity; and 
‐ participating in other health programmes, that did not include a pedometer.
The programmes lasted from two weeks to two years; assessments continued for three to ten months afterwards. 
We were most interested to see whether there pedometers had a lasting effect on physical activity and health. We were also interested in learning about effects on sedentary behaviour (time spent sitting), risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes (blood pressure, body mass index (BMI) and levels of cholesterol in the blood), quality of life (well‐being) and adverse (unwanted) effects. 
What are the results of our review? 
Compared with no or a minimal health programme: 
Pedometer programmes may not affect physical activity at least one month after the programme end (6 studies), but they may reduce sedentary behaviour and may improve people's well‐being (1 study). We have very little certainty about these results. 
Pedometer programmes may slightly reduce body mass index (3 studies, low certainty), but probably make little to no difference in blood pressure (2 studies, moderate certainty) and may reduce unwanted effects such as injuries (2 studies, low certainty). 
No studies measured cholesterol or disease risk scores at least one month after the programme ended. 
Compared with another health programme:
Pedometer programmes may affect physical activity after at least one month since the programme end (1 study), but we have very little certainty about this result. 
We could not draw conclusions about unwanted effects. The evidence was not good enough for us to be certain about effects on sedentary behaviour, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, cardiovascular disease risk and well‐being. Some effects were seen but findings were not consistent. 
Conclusions 
Exercise programmes can have positive effects on an employee's physical activity and health, but we did not find enough reliable evidence to be certain whether a pedometer programme is better than other types of health programmes, especially for achieving long‐term changes in behaviour. 
Evidence is uncertain because results were reported by a small number of studies — sometimes only one study. In most studies, the people involved knew which study group they were in, which can affect results. Many people dropped out of studies before the studies ended, so not enough results were collected. Some studies did not report any results for some measures we were interested in or did not assess/evaluate if benefits were maintained after the program ended. 
As pedometers are largely being replaced by more sophisticated devices such as accelerometers and Smartphone apps, we will not update this review again.","# Plain Language Summary: Pedometers in the Workplace

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether using pedometers (step counters) at work helps people exercise more and stay healthier. Researchers searched for studies that tested pedometer programs in workplaces and compared them to either no program or other exercise programs.

## Why does this matter?

Most people don't exercise enough. The World Health Organization recommends 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week. Workplaces are good places to encourage people to be more active. Pedometers are simple devices that count your steps and give you feedback to motivate you to move more.

## What did researchers find?

The review included 14 studies with 4,762 people from various countries. Most participants were about 41 years old and worked in different types of workplaces (offices, factories, etc.). Some were healthy; others were at risk for health problems from being inactive or overweight.

**Main findings:**

- **Physical activity**: Pedometer programs may not have lasting effects on how much people exercise after the program ends.
- **Body weight**: Pedometer programs may slightly reduce body mass index (BMI), but the effect is small.
- **Blood pressure**: Pedometer programs probably have little to no effect on blood pressure.
- **Injuries**: Pedometer programs may reduce injuries in people who get hurt frequently.
- **Quality of life**: There may be small improvements in mental health, but evidence is weak.

## Important limitations

Most studies had quality problems, such as not comparing fairly or having many people drop out. The evidence is not strong enough to say pedometers definitely work better than other exercise programs.

## What do experts recommend?

Pedometers are becoming outdated because smartphones and newer devices now track steps automatically. Decision-makers should be cautious about spending money on large pedometer programs. Future studies should focus on newer technology and find ways to help people stay active long-term.","### Plain Language Summary

**Purpose of the Study**

Researchers wanted to find out if using pedometers at work helps people move more and improve their long-term health.

**Who Was Involved?**

The study looked at employed adults, not athletes. It included 14 different studies with a total of 4,762 people, mostly around 41 years old. These studies took place in offices and other workplaces in high-income countries.

**What Was Done?**

- The participants used pedometers, which are simple tools that count steps, as part of health programs at work.
- The study compared those using pedometers to people with little or no extra help or other types of exercise programs.
- The programs lasted from one week to two years, with check-ins three to ten months afterward.

**What Were They Looking For?**

The main goal was to see if using a pedometer at work made people more active. They also checked if pedometers affected body size, blood pressure, and mental health.

**Findings**

- **Movement:** Pedometers might not make a big difference in how active people are. The results were uncertain.
- **Body and Health:** Pedometers might slightly reduce body size (BMI) but probably don’t change blood pressure much. They might help reduce injuries.
- **Overall Impact:** The pedometers had some positive effects right after the program but not much later on.

**Conclusion**

Using pedometers at work might help, but not as much as other more modern devices like those on Smartphones. Future research should focus on new tools and measure long-lasting effects. Decision-makers should be careful about spending a lot on pedometers since the effects might not last."
"Background
Adequate haemodialysis (HD) in people with end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) is reliant upon establishment of vascular access, which may consist of arteriovenous fistula, arteriovenous graft, or central venous catheters (CVC). Although discouraged due to high rates of infectious and thrombotic complications as well as technical issues that limit their life span, CVC have the significant advantage of being immediately usable and are the only means of vascular access in a significant number of patients. Previous studies have established the role of thrombolytic agents (TLA) in the prevention of catheter malfunction. Systematic review of different thrombolytic agents has also identified their utility in restoration of catheter patency following catheter malfunction. To date the use and efficacy of fibrin sheath stripping and catheter exchange have not been evaluated against thrombolytic agents. 
Objectives
This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of TLA, preparations, doses and administration as well as fibrin‐sheath stripping, over‐the‐wire catheter exchange or any other intervention proposed for management of tunnelled CVC malfunction in patients with ESKD on HD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 17 August 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Specialised Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
We included all studies conducted in people with ESKD who rely on tunnelled CVC for either initiation or maintenance of HD access and who require restoration of catheter patency following late‐onset catheter malfunction and evaluated the role of TLA, fibrin sheath stripping or over‐the‐wire catheter exchange to restore catheter function. The primary outcome was be restoration of line patency defined as ≥ 300 mL/min or adequate to complete a HD session or as defined by the study authors. Secondary outcomes included dialysis adequacy and adverse outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed retrieved studies to determine which studies satisfy the inclusion criteria and carried out data extraction. Included studies were assessed for risk of bias. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using GRADE. 
Main results
Our search strategy identified 8 studies (580 participants) as eligible for inclusion in this review. Interventions included: thrombolytic therapy versus placebo (1 study); low versus high dose thrombolytic therapy (1); alteplase versus urokinase (1); short versus long thrombolytic dwell (1); thrombolytic therapy versus percutaneous fibrin sheath stripping (1); fibrin sheath stripping versus over‐the‐wire catheter exchange (1); and over‐the‐wire catheter exchange versus exchange with and without angioplasty sheath disruption (1). No two studies compared the same interventions. Most studies had a high risk of bias due to poor study design, broad inclusion criteria, low patient numbers and industry involvement. 
Based on low certainty evidence, thrombolytic therapy may restore catheter function when compared to placebo (149 participants: RR 4.05, 95% CI 1.42 to 11.56) but there is no data available to suggest an optimal dose or administration method. The certainty of this evidence is reduced due to the fact that it is based on only a single study with wide confidence limits, high risk of bias and imprecision in the estimates of adverse events (149 participants: RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.38 to 10.73). 
Based on the available evidence, physical disruption of a fibrin sheath using interventional radiology techniques appears to be equally efficacious as the use of a pharmaceutical thrombolytic agent for the immediate management of dysfunctional catheters (57 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07). 
Catheter patency is poor following use of thrombolytic agents with studies reporting median catheter survival rates of 14 to 42 days and was reported to improve significantly by fibrin sheath stripping or catheter exchange (37 participants: MD ‐27.70 days, 95% CI ‐51.00 to ‐4.40). Catheter exchange was reported to be superior to sheath disruption with respect to catheter survival (30 participants: MD 213.00 days, 95% CI 205.70 to 220.30). 
There is insufficient evidence to suggest any specific intervention is superior in terms of ensuring either dialysis adequacy or reduced risk of adverse events. 
Authors' conclusions
Thrombolysis, fibrin sheath disruption and over‐the‐wire catheter exchange are effective and appropriate therapies for immediately restoring catheter patency in dysfunctional cuffed and tunnelled HD catheters. On current data there is no evidence to support physical intervention over the use of pharmaceutical agents in the acute setting. Pharmacological interventions appear to have a bridging role and long‐term catheter survival may be improved by fibrin sheath disruption and is probably superior following catheter exchange. There is no evidence favouring any of these approaches with respect to dialysis adequacy or risk of adverse events. 
The current review is limited by the small number of available studies with limited numbers of patients enrolled. Most of the studies included in this review were judged to have a high risk of bias and were potentially influenced by pharmaceutical industry involvement. 
Further research is required to adequately address the question of the most efficacious and clinically appropriate technique for HD catheter dysfunction.","Interventions for treating central venous catheter malfunction
What is the issue? 
Patients who rely on haemodialysis due to kidney failure require vascular access and although not optimal, a tunnelled haemodialysis catheter is frequently used. Unfortunately, along with infection issues these lines are prone to dysfunction due to clotting and fibrin sheath formation. Medications such as alteplase have a recognised role in preventing line dysfunction but the best approach to treating established line dysfunction has not been found. 
What did we do? 
We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register up to 17 August 2017 and performed a systematic review of studies performed in patients with dysfunctional haemodialysis catheters and compared the success of thrombolytic agents, fibrin sheath stripping and line replacement. 
What did we find? 
We found eight studies involving 580 participants that tested the three different treatments. Studies also compared drug dosages and methods of administration. The quality of evidence is limited by small study size and high risk of bias. Thrombolytic therapy was probably better than placebo at restoring catheter function but there was no optimal dose or administration method. Physical disruption of a fibrin sheath may be equally effective as pharmaceutical thrombolytic agent for immediate management of catheter dysfunction. Catheter patency at two weeks is probably better following fibrin sheath stripping or catheter exchange compared to thrombolytic agent. Catheter exchange may be better than sheath disruption for long‐term catheter survival and the use of both techniques together is probably best. There is currently insufficient evidence favouring any technique in terms of either dialysis adequacy or reduced risk of adverse events. 
Conclusions 
Further research is required to adequately address the question of the most effective technique for haemodialysis catheter dysfunction.","# Plain Language Summary: Treatments for Dialysis Catheter Problems

## What is this study about?

People with severe kidney disease need dialysis—a treatment that cleans their blood. Many patients use a special tube (catheter) placed in a vein to receive dialysis. Sometimes these tubes stop working properly. This review looked at different ways to fix broken catheters.

## Who was studied?

The review included 8 studies with 580 people total who had kidney disease and used dialysis catheters that stopped working.

## What treatments were compared?

Researchers tested three main approaches:

1. **Medicine (thrombolytic therapy)**: A drug injected into the catheter to dissolve blood clots
2. **Physical removal**: A procedure where doctors use special tools to strip away a layer of material blocking the catheter
3. **Catheter replacement**: Removing the old catheter and putting in a new one

## What did they find?

**Immediate results (getting the catheter working again):**
- Medicine worked better than doing nothing
- Physical removal worked about as well as medicine
- All three methods could get catheters working again right away

**Long-term results (how long the catheter stayed working):**
- Catheters fixed with medicine only lasted 2–6 weeks
- Physical removal lasted longer
- Replacing the catheter lasted the longest (about 7 months)

**Safety and dialysis quality:**
- Not enough information to say which method was safest
- Not enough information to say which method worked best for dialysis quality

## Important limitations

- Only 8 studies were available, with small numbers of patients
- Most studies had quality problems
- Some studies were funded by medicine companies

## Bottom line

All three treatments can fix broken catheters right away, but replacing the catheter works best for the long term. More research is needed to find the best approach.","### Summary of Clinical Trial on Kidney Disease Catheter Treatments

**Objective:**  
This study looked at the best ways to keep dialysis catheters working well for people with end-stage kidney disease who need dialysis.

**Who is this for?**  
The study focused on people with advanced kidney disease using a specific type of catheter for dialysis.

**What did they study?**  
Researchers compared different methods to fix catheters when they stop working properly. These methods included:
- Medicines that break down clots in the catheters.
- Techniques to physically clean the catheter.
- Replacing the catheter.

**What were they trying to find out?**  
The study aimed to see which methods were best for getting catheters to work again, ensuring dialysis worked well, and avoiding problems.

**Timeline:**  
The review included research studies up to August 2017.

**Safety and Results:**  
- Medicines can help fix catheters but don't last very long (14 to 42 days).
- Physically cleaning the catheter or replacing it might help it work longer.
- In general, all methods seemed to get the catheters working again right away.
- More research is needed to find out which method is the safest and most effective long-term since many studies had limited data.

**Conclusion:**  
Medications and physical cleaning or replacing catheters can fix problems, but we still don't know which is best for the long term. More studies are needed to decide on the best approach."
"Background
Thromboangiitis obliterans, also known as Buerger's disease, is a non‐atherosclerotic, segmental inflammatory pathology that most commonly affects the small‐ and medium‐sized arteries, veins, and nerves in the upper and lower extremities. The etiology is unknown, but involves hereditary susceptibility, tobacco exposure, immune and coagulation responses. In many cases, there is no possibility of revascularization to improve the condition. Stem cell therapy is an option for patients with severe complications, such as ischemic ulcers or rest pain. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of stem cell therapy in individuals with thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease). 
Search methods
The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and AMED databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 17 October 2017. The review authors searched the European grey literature OpenGrey Database, screened reference lists of relevant studies and contacted study authors. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs of stem cell therapy in thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease). 
Data collection and analysis
The review authors (DC, DM, FN) independently assessed the studies, extracted data and performed data analysis. 
Main results
We only included one RCT (18 participants with thromboangiitis obliterans) comparing the implantation of stem cell derived from bone marrow with placebo and standard wound dressing care in this review. We identified no studies that compared stem cell therapy (bone marrow source) versus stem cell therapy (umbilical cord source), stem cell therapy (any source) versus pharmacological treatment and stem cell therapy (any source) versus sympathectomy. Ulcer healing was assessed in the form of ulcer size. The mean ulcer area decreased more in the stem cell implantation group: from 5.04 cm2 (standard deviation (SD) 0.70) to 1.48 cm2 (SD 0.56) compared with the control group: mean ulcer size area decreased from 4.68 cm2 (SD 0.62) to 3.59 cm2 (SD 0.14); mean difference (MD) ‐2.11 cm2, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐2.49 to ‐1.73; 1 study, 18 participants; very low‐quality evidence. Pain‐free walking distance showed more of an improvement in the stem cell implantation group: from mean of 38.33 meters (SD 17.68) to 284.44 meters (SD 212.12) compared with the control group: mean walking distance increased from 35.66 meters (SD 19.79) to 78.22 meters (SD 35.35); MD 206.22 meters, 95% CI 65.73 to 346.71; 1 study; 18 participants; very low‐quality evidence. 
Outcomes such as rate of amputation, pain, amputation‐free survival and adverse effects were not assessed. 
The quality of evidence was classified as very low, with only one study, small numbers of participants, high risk of bias in many domains and missing information regarding tobacco exposure status. 
Authors' conclusions
Very low‐quality evidence suggests there may be an effect of the use of bone marrow‐derived stem cells in the healing of ulcers and improvement in the pain‐free walking distance in patients with Buerger's disease. High‐quality trials assessing the effectiveness of stem cell therapy for treatment of patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) are needed.","Stem cell therapy for treatment of thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease)
Background 
Thromboangiitis obliterans, also known as Buerger's disease, is a condition characterized by recurring progressive inflammation and clotting in small‐ and medium‐sized arteries and veins of the hands and feet. Its cause is unknown, but it is most common in men with a history of tobacco use. It is responsible for ulcers and extreme pain in the limbs of young smokers. In many cases, mainly in patients with the most severe form, there is no possibility of improving the condition with surgery, and therefore, alternative treatments are used. Stem cell therapy is an experimental treatment performed through the implantation of cells (from bone marrow, umbilical cord, peripheral blood etc.) which are capable of becoming new blood vessels, improving local circulation and contributing to the healing of ulcers and relieving rest pain. This review assessed the effectiveness of stem cell therapy in the treatment of patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease). 
Key results 
Only one randomized controlled study (18 participants with thromboangiitis obliterans) comparing the implantation of stem cells derived from bone marrow with placebo and standard wound dressing care was included in this review (most recent search was 17 October 2017). We identified no studies that compared stem cell therapy from different sources, stem cell therapy versus drug treatment and stem cell therapy versus sympathectomy (surgical cutting of a sympathetic nerve). The results showed a decrease in ulcer size and improvement in pain‐free walking distance in the group receiving the stem cell implantation compared with the group receiving placebo and standard wound dressing care. 
Outcomes such as rate of amputation, pain, amputation‐free survival and adverse effects were not assessed. 
Quality of the evidence 
We classified the quality of evidence as very low, because there was only one study, small numbers of participants, and high risk of bias in many domains and missing information regarding tobacco exposure status. 
Conclusions 
Very low‐quality evidence suggests there may be an effect of the use of bone marrow‐derived stem cells in the healing of ulcers and improving the pain‐free walking distance in patients with Buerger's disease. High‐quality trials assessing the effectiveness of stem cell therapy for treatment of patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) are needed.","# Plain Language Summary: Stem Cell Therapy for Buerger's Disease

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether stem cell therapy (a type of treatment using special cells from the body) can help people with Buerger's disease, a condition that affects blood vessels in the arms and legs.

## What is Buerger's disease?

Buerger's disease is a rare condition where blood vessels in the arms and legs become inflamed and damaged. This can cause pain, slow-healing sores (ulcers), and difficulty walking. The cause is not fully known, but smoking and family history play a role. Sometimes surgery cannot fix the damaged blood vessels, so doctors look for other treatments.

## What did researchers want to find out?

Researchers wanted to know if stem cell therapy is safe and effective for treating Buerger's disease.

## What did they find?

The researchers found only **one study** with 18 people that tested stem cell therapy. In this study:

- **Ulcer healing**: People who received stem cells had larger ulcers shrink more than people who received a placebo (fake treatment). Ulcers in the stem cell group shrank by about 3.5 square centimeters more.

- **Walking ability**: People who received stem cells could walk much farther without pain—about 206 meters farther than the placebo group.

## Important limitations

- Only one small study was available
- The study had some quality issues
- Researchers did not measure amputation rates, pain levels, or serious side effects
- More research is needed

## Bottom line

There is very weak evidence that stem cell therapy *might* help heal ulcers and improve walking in people with Buerger's disease. However, much better studies are needed before doctors can recommend this treatment.","### Plain Language Summary

**What is this study about?**
This study looked at stem cell therapy to see if it can help people with a condition called Buerger's disease. This disease affects blood vessels in the arms and legs, causing pain and sores. 

**What was the goal?**
The researchers wanted to find out if stem cell therapy is safe and if it works to help heal sores and reduce pain in people with this disease. 

**How was the study conducted?**
Researchers searched various medical databases to find studies about stem cell therapy for Buerger's disease. They focused on studies where participants were randomly chosen to get either the treatment or something else, like standard care or a placebo.

**What did the researchers find?**
They found only one small study with 18 participants. In this study, some people received stem cell therapy from bone marrow, while others got a placebo and standard wound care.

- **Sore Healing:** The sores on people who got stem cell therapy got much smaller compared to those in the other group.
- **Walking Improvement:** People who got stem cell therapy could walk much farther without pain compared to the others.

**What wasn't covered?**
The study didn’t look at other important outcomes like the number of amputations or side effects.

**How reliable are these results?**
The results are considered very low-quality because there was only one small study, and several important details were missing.

**What do the researchers suggest?**
They think more high-quality studies are needed to really understand how well stem cell therapy works for people with Buerger's disease."
"Background
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurologic disorder that is associated with peripheral iron deficiency in a subgroup of patients. It is unclear whether iron therapy is effective treatment for RLS. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral or parenteral iron for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) when compared with placebo or other therapies. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycNFO, and CINAHL for the time period January 1995 to September 2017. We searched reference lists for additional published studies. We searched Clinicaltrials.gov and other clinical trial registries (September 2017) for ongoing or unpublished studies. 
Selection criteria
Controlled trials comparing any formulation of iron with placebo, other medications, or no treatment, in adults diagnosed with RLS according to expert clinical interview or explicit diagnostic criteria. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality, with discussion to reach consensus in the case of any disagreement. The primary outcome considered in this review was restlessness or unpleasant sensations, as experienced subjectively by the patient. We combined treatment/control differences in the outcomes across studies using random‐effects meta‐analyses. We analysed continuous data using mean differences (MDs) where possible and performed standardised mean difference (SMD) analyses when different measurements were used across studies. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data using the Mantel‐Haenszel method and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed study heterogeneity using the I2 statistic. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We performed GRADE analysis using GRADEpro. 
Main results
We identified and included 10 studies (428 total participants, followed for 2‐16 weeks) in this review. Our primary outcome was restlessness or uncomfortable leg sensations, which was quantified using the International Restless Legs Scale (IRLS) (range, 0 to 40) in eight trials and a different RLS symptom scale in a ninth trial. Nine studies compared iron to placebo and one study compared iron to a dopamine agonist (pramipexole). The possibility for bias among the trials was variable. Three studies had a single element with high risk of bias, which was lack of blinding in two and incomplete outcome data in one. All studies had at least one feature resulting in unclear risk of bias. 
Combining data from the seven trials using the IRLS to compare iron and placebo, use of iron resulted in greater improvement in IRLS scores (MD ‐3.78, 95% CI ‐6.25 to ‐1.31; I2= 66%, 7 studies, 345 participants) measured 2 to 12 weeks after treatment. Including an eighth study, which measured restlessness using a different scale, use of iron remained beneficial compared to placebo (SMD ‐0.74, 95% CI ‐1.26 to ‐0.23; I2 = 80%, 8 studies, 370 participants). The GRADE assessment of certainty for this outcome was moderate. 
The single study comparing iron to a dopamine agonist (pramipexole) found a similar reduction in RLS severity in the two groups (MD ‐0.40, 95% CI ‐5.93 to 5.13, 30 participants). 
Assessment of secondary outcomes was limited by small numbers of trials assessing each outcome. Iron did not improve quality of life as a dichotomous measure (RR 2.01, 95% CI 0.54 to 7.45; I2=54%, 2 studies, 39 participants), but did improve quality of life measured on continuous scales (SMD 0.51, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.87; I2= 0%, 3 studies, 128 participants), compared to placebo. Subjective sleep quality was no different between iron and placebo groups (SMD 0.19, 95% CI ‐0.18 to 0.56; I2 = 9%, 3 studies, 128 participants), nor was objective sleep quality, as measured by change in sleep efficiency in a single study (‐35.5 +/‐ 92.0 versus ‐41.4 +/‐ 98.2, 18 participants). Periodic limb movements of sleep were not significantly reduced with iron compared to placebo ( SMD ‐0.19, 95% CI ‐0.70 to 0.32; I2 = 0%, 2 studies, 60 participants). Iron did not improve sleepiness compared to placebo, as measured on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (data not provided, 1 study, 60 participants) but did improve the daytime tiredness item of the RLS‐6 compared to placebo (least squares mean difference ‐1.5, 95% CI ‐2.5 to ‐0.6; 1 study, 110 participants). The GRADE rating for secondary outcomes ranged from low to very low. 
Prespecified subgroup analyses showed more improvement with iron in those trials studying participants on dialysis. The use of low serum ferritin levels as an inclusion criteria and the use or oral versus intravenous iron did not show significant subgroup differences. 
Iron did not result in significantly more adverse events than placebo (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.25; I2=45%, 6 studies, 298 participants). A single study reported that people treated with iron therapy experienced fewer adverse events than the active comparator pramipexole. 
Authors' conclusions
Iron therapy probably improves restlessness and RLS severity in comparison to placebo. Iron therapy may not increase the risk of side effects in comparison to placebo. We are uncertain whether iron therapy improves quality of life in comparison to placebo. Iron therapy may make little or no difference to pramipexole in restlessness and RLS severity, as well as in the risk of adverse events. The effect on secondary outcomes such as quality of life, daytime functioning, and sleep quality, the optimal timing and formulation of administration, and patient characteristics predicting response require additional study.","Iron for the treatment of restless legs syndrome
Background 
Restless legs syndrome is a common medical condition that causes uncomfortable urges to move the legs. These urges happen in the evening and at night and can keep people from sleeping well. Low blood levels of iron are often seen in people who have restless legs syndrome. Low blood iron levels may be part of the cause of restless legs syndrome. Iron can be taken as a pill or given as an injection into the bloodstream. We performed this review to see if iron treatment reduces the symptoms of restless legs syndrome. 
Study characteristics 
We included 10 studies of iron. These 10 studies included 428 people with restless legs syndrome. Not all participants had low blood levels of iron. All participants were adults. Most of the studies used injections of iron, while three studies used iron in pill form. Iron treatment was compared to a non‐active treatment (i.e. a placebo) in nine studies. In one study, iron was compared to another restless legs syndrome treatment called a dopamine agonist. The main measure of interest in our review was the severity of restlessness. This was usually measured using a 10‐question survey regarding severity and effects of urges to move the legs, called the International Restless Legs Syndrome Severity Rating Scale (IRLS). This was measured 2‐4 weeks after injections of iron and 12‐14 weeks after iron in pill form. 
Four trials were funded by the drug manufacturer. Two trials were funded by the USA National Institutes of Health. Two trials were funded by the workplaces of the study investigators. Two studies did not report who funded the study. The four studies funded by drug manufacturers were the largest. The studies funded by drug companies contributed over half of the total number of participants. 
Key results and quality of evidence 
Overall, the studies showed that iron is better than a placebo for reducing the severity of restless legs syndrome symptoms, although the benefit was low to moderate. This is mostly based on studies using injections of iron, rather than iron pills. Iron was helpful even if blood iron levels were normal at the start of the study. The quality of the evidence was moderate, because not all completed studies have been published, not all important outcomes have been measured, and not enough people have been studied. Side effects were not more common with iron than with placebo. Based on one study, side effects were less common with iron than with another commonly used restless legs syndrome treatment, although the certainty in this result is very low. More studies are needed to allow people with RLS and doctors to make decisions about who should take iron for restless legs syndrome treatment, using what type of iron, and for how long. The evidence is current to September 2017.","# Plain Language Summary: Iron Treatment for Restless Legs Syndrome

## What is this study about?

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a condition where people feel uncomfortable sensations in their legs, usually at night, that make them want to move around. Some people with RLS don't have enough iron in their blood. This review looked at whether giving iron to people with RLS helps them feel better.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for studies that tested iron treatment (given by mouth or injection) against a fake treatment (placebo) or other medicines. They found 10 studies with 428 people total. People were followed for 2 to 16 weeks.

## What were the main results?

**Iron vs. placebo:**
- Iron helped reduce uncomfortable leg sensations better than placebo
- The improvement was moderate
- Iron did not cause more side effects than placebo

**Iron vs. another medicine (pramipexole):**
- Both treatments worked about the same

**Other effects:**
- Iron may have helped some people feel less tired during the day
- Iron did not clearly improve sleep quality
- Results for quality of life were mixed

## Key takeaways

- **Iron probably helps** reduce restless leg symptoms compared to placebo
- **Side effects** were not worse with iron than placebo
- **More research is needed** to understand which people benefit most and what type of iron works best

## Timeline

Studies lasted 2 to 16 weeks.","### Summary of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and Iron Therapy Study

**Objective**
The study looks at whether taking iron helps people with restless legs syndrome (RLS) feel better and whether it's safe. It compares iron treatment to a fake treatment (placebo) and another medicine.

**Who Participated?**
Adults diagnosed with RLS were part of the study. They either got iron pills or shots, a placebo, or a different medication.

**What Happened?**
- The study included 10 trials with 428 people, lasting from 2 to 16 weeks.
- Nine studies compared iron to a placebo.
- One study compared iron to a medicine called pramipexole.

**Results**
- People taking iron had less restlessness and leg discomfort than those taking a placebo.
- There was no big difference between iron and pramipexole for RLS symptoms.
- Iron slightly improved life quality on some measures but didn't affect sleep quality or reduce leg movements during sleep.
- Those on dialysis seemed to benefit more from iron.

**Safety**
Iron didn't cause more side effects than the placebo.

**Conclusion**
Iron might help reduce RLS symptoms compared to a placebo without extra side effects. However, more research is needed to see how it affects overall quality of life and other factors like sleep and daytime tiredness."
"Background
Stroke is one of the leading causes of long‐lasting disability and mortality and its global burden has increased in the past two decades. Several therapies have been proposed for the recovery from, and treatment of, ischemic stroke. One of them is citicoline. This review assessed the benefits and harms of citicoline for treating patients with acute ischemic stroke. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical benefits and harms of citicoline compared with placebo or any other control for treating people with acute ischemic stroke. 
Search methods
We searched in the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, LILACS until 29 January 2020. We searched the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Additionally, we also reviewed reference lists of the retrieved publications and review articles, and searched the websites of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA). 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in any setting including participants with acute ischemic stroke. Trials were eligible for inclusion if they compared citicoline versus placebo or no intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
We selected RCTs, assessed the risk of bias in seven domains, and extracted data by duplicate. Our primary outcomes of interest were all‐cause mortality and the degree of disability or dependence in daily activities at 90 days. We estimated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes. We measured statistical heterogeneity using the I² statistic. We conducted our analyses using the fixed‐effect and random‐effects model meta‐analyses. We assessed the overall quality of evidence for six pre‐specified outcomes using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We identified 10 RCTs including 4281 participants. In all these trials, citicoline was given either orally, intravenously, or a combination of both compared with placebo or standard care therapy. Citicoline doses ranged between 500 mg and 2000 mg per day. We assessed all the included trials as having high risk of bias. Drug companies sponsored six trials. 
A pooled analysis of eight trials indicates there may be little or no difference in all‐cause mortality comparing citicoline with placebo (17.3% versus 18.5%; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07; I² = 0%; low‐quality evidence due to risk of bias). Four trials showed that citicoline may not increase the proportion of patients with a moderate or lower degree of disability or dependence compared with placebo, according to the Rankin Scale (21.72% versus 19.23%; RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.26; I² = 1%; low‐quality evidence due to risk of bias). 
Meta‐analysis of three trials indicates there may be little or no difference in serious cardiovascular adverse events comparing citicoline with placebo (8.83% versus 7.77%; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.29; I² = 0%; low‐quality evidence due to risk of bias). Overall, either serious or non‐serious adverse events – central nervous system, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, etc. – were poorly reported and harms may have been underestimated. 
Four trials suggested that citicoline results in no difference in functional recovery, according to the Barthel Index, compared with placebo (32.78% versus 30.70%; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.13; I² = 24%; low‐quality evidence due to risk of bias). Citicoline may not increase the proportion of patients with a minor impairment (according to ≤ 1 scores in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) (5 trials, 24.31% versus 22.44%; RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.21; I² = 27%, low‐quality evidence due to risk of bias). None of the included trials reported data on quality of life. 
A pre‐planned Trial Sequential Analysis suggested that no more trials may be needed for the primary outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
This review assessed the clinical benefits and harms of citicoline compared with placebo or any other standard treatment for people with acute ischemic stroke. The findings of the review suggest there may be little to no difference between citicoline and its controls regarding all‐cause mortality, disability or dependence in daily activities, functional recovery, neurological function and severe adverse events, based on low‐certainty evidence. None of the included trials assessed quality of life and the safety profile of citicoline remains unknown. The available evidence is of low quality due to either limitations in the design or execution of the trials.","Citicoline for treating people with acute ischemic stroke
Review questionWhat is the clinical benefit and harm of citicoline compared with placebo or other standard treatment for treating people with acute ischemic stroke? 
BackgroundAcute ischemic stroke is defined as a sudden episode of disturbance of brain function caused by a blockage in the blood vessels of the brain. It is the leading cause of long‐lasting disability and the second major cause of death. Citicoline is a substance that may prevent the death of brain cells located close to the area of brain damage. 
Search dateSearching was completed on 29 January 2020 
Study characteristicsWe included randomized controlled trials, both published and unpublished. We did not apply any limitation by language, country, or study design. We included people (adults or children) with acute ischemic stroke irrespective of the underlying cause. Stroke was based on the clinical diagnosis confirmed with brain scans. We included trials that compared citicoline with placebo, usual care, or other usual treatment. 
Key resultsWe identified 10 relevant trials that included 4281 participants; six trials were carried out in multiple centers and two were international. We considered most trials to be at high risk of bias and they included small numbers of participants. This raises the risk of over‐estimating benefits and under‐estimating harms. Trials tested citicoline given either by mouth or by injection. Citicoline did not seem to influence death or disability in daily activities, severe side‐effects, functional recovery, or neurological recovery. 
Quality of the evidenceRisks of bias, imprecision, and outcome reporting bias all make the quality of evidence low. None of the included trials reported data on quality of life. Researchers poorly reported harms caused by citicoline, so the profile of harms remains unclear.","# Plain Language Summary: Citicoline for Stroke Treatment

## What is this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if a medicine called citicoline helps people who have had a stroke. A stroke happens when blood flow to the brain stops suddenly. This review looked at 10 different studies with about 4,281 people total to see if citicoline works better than a fake medicine (placebo) or standard care.

## Who was in the studies?

People who had recently had an ischemic stroke (the most common type of stroke, caused by a blood clot).

## What did they test?

Researchers gave some people citicoline (doses ranged from 500 to 2,000 mg per day) by mouth, through an IV, or both. Other people got a placebo or standard care. They compared what happened to both groups.

## What did they find?

**Main Results:**
- **Death rates:** About the same in both groups (17.3% with citicoline vs. 18.5% with placebo)
- **Disability:** No clear difference in how well people could do daily activities
- **Recovery:** No clear difference in how much people improved
- **Serious side effects:** About the same in both groups

## Important notes:

- The quality of evidence was low because the studies had design problems
- Drug companies paid for six of the ten studies
- Researchers didn't find enough information about side effects
- No studies measured quality of life

## Bottom line:

Based on this review, citicoline does not appear to help people recover better from stroke compared to placebo or standard treatment.","**Citicoline for Stroke Recovery: A Plain Language Summary**

**What Is the Study About?**

This study looks at how a treatment called citicoline works for people who have just had a stroke. A stroke happens when blood flow to the brain is blocked, affecting normal functioning.

**What Was the Aim?**

The goal was to see if citicoline helps people recover from a stroke and if it has any negative effects.

**Who Was Involved?**

The study included 4,281 people who had recently experienced a stroke. They were part of different trials testing citicoline compared to a fake treatment (placebo).

**What Did They Do?**

Participants were given citicoline in various forms (pills or injections) in doses ranging from 500 mg to 2000 mg daily. Researchers then compared these participants to those who did not receive citicoline.

**What Were They Looking For?**

1. Changes in death rates
2. Level of disability or need for help with daily activities after 90 days
3. Any serious health problems caused by the treatment

**Key Findings**

- Citicoline seems to make little to no difference in survival rates compared to not taking it.
- It also doesn’t seem to help much with reducing the need for help in daily tasks.
- Similar results were found for serious health problems related to the treatment.

**Safety and Quality of Life**

There wasn’t enough information about the safety of citicoline or its effect on people’s overall quality of life.

**Conclusion**

Overall, citicoline appears to have little to no effect compared to not taking it after a stroke, based on low-quality evidence. More research is not currently planned for these outcomes."
"Background
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) often complicates the clinical course of cancer. The risk is further increased by chemotherapy, but the trade‐off between safety and efficacy of primary thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy is uncertain. This is the third update of a review first published in February 2012. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of primary thromboprophylaxis for VTE in ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis, or an active control intervention. 
Search methods
For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 3 August 2020. We also searched the reference lists of identified studies and contacted content experts and trialists for relevant references. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing any oral or parenteral anticoagulant or mechanical intervention to no thromboprophylaxis or placebo, or comparing two different anticoagulants. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data on risk of bias, participant characteristics, interventions, and outcomes including symptomatic VTE and major bleeding as the primary effectiveness and safety outcomes, respectively. We applied GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We identified six additional randomised controlled trials (3326 participants) for this update, bringing the included study total to 32 (15,678 participants), all evaluating pharmacological interventions and performed mainly in people with locally advanced or metastatic cancer. The certainty of the evidence ranged from high to very low across the different outcomes and comparisons. The main limiting factors were imprecision and risk of bias. 
Thromboprophylaxis with direct oral anticoagulants (direct factor Xa inhibitors apixaban and rivaroxaban) may decrease the incidence of symptomatic VTE (risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 1.06; 3 studies, 1526 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and probably increases the risk of major bleeding compared with placebo (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.82 to 3.68; 3 studies, 1494 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
When compared with no thromboprophylaxis, low‐molecular‐weight heparin (LMWH) reduced the incidence of symptomatic VTE (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.83; 11 studies, 3931 participants; high‐certainty evidence); and probably increased the risk of major bleeding events (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.35; 15 studies, 7282 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
In participants with multiple myeloma, LMWH resulted in lower symptomatic VTE compared with the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.83; 1 study, 439 participants; high‐certainty evidence), while LMWH probably lowers symptomatic VTE more than aspirin (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.17; 2 studies, 781 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Major bleeding was observed in none of the participants with multiple myeloma treated with LMWH or warfarin and in less than 1% of those treated with aspirin. 
Only one study evaluated unfractionated heparin against no thromboprophylaxis, but did not report on VTE or major bleeding. 
When compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis, warfarin may importantly reduce symptomatic VTE (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.20; 1 study, 311 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and may result in a large increase in major bleeding (RR 3.82, 95% CI 0.97 to 15.04; 4 studies, 994 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
One study evaluated antithrombin versus no antithrombin in children. This study did not report on symptomatic VTE but did report any VTE (symptomatic and incidental VTE). The effect of antithrombin on any VTE and major bleeding is uncertain (any VTE: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.73; major bleeding: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.03 to 18.57; 1 study, 85 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
In ambulatory cancer patients, primary thromboprophylaxis with direct factor Xa inhibitors may reduce the incidence of symptomatic VTE (low‐certainty evidence) and probably increases the risk of major bleeding (moderate‐certainty evidence) when compared with placebo. LMWH decreases the incidence of symptomatic VTE (high‐certainty evidence), but increases the risk of major bleeding (moderate‐certainty evidence) when compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis. Evidence for the use of thromboprophylaxis with anticoagulants other than direct factor Xa inhibitors and LMWH is limited. More studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of primary prophylaxis in specific types of chemotherapeutic agents and types of cancer, such as gastrointestinal or genitourinary cancer.","Prevention of blood clots in non‐hospitalised cancer patients receiving chemotherapy
Background 
Cancer patients are more likely than people without cancer to develop venous thromboembolism (blood clots in the veins). Chemotherapy may activate blood coagulation (clotting) and further increase this risk. Anticoagulants are medicines which are used to prevent and treat blood clots. They are sometimes known as blood thinners. This systematic review aimed to look at the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulants and mechanical interventions when used to prevent blood clots in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. 
Key results 
We included 32 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) involving 15,678 participants (current search to August 2020). All studies evaluated anticoagulants and were performed mainly in people with locally advanced (unlikely to be cured) or metastatic (where the cancer has spread from the part of the body where it started) cancer. Direct oral anticoagulants (anticoagulants that act by directly binding to and inhibiting specific coagulation factors – thrombin or activated factor X) may reduce the occurrence of blood clots and probably increase the risk of major bleeding in people with cancer. Low‐molecular‐weight heparins (anticoagulants that increase the activity of the natural anticoagulant antithrombin) were associated with a reduction in symptomatic blood clots, but increased the risk of major bleeding. In people with the blood‐related cancer, multiple myeloma, low‐molecular‐weight heparin reduced the number of symptomatic blood clots when compared with the vitamin K antagonist warfarin, while the difference with aspirin was not clear; there were no major bleeds with low‐molecular‐weight heparin or warfarin, and in participants treated with aspirin the rate was below 1%. One study evaluated unfractionated heparin and did not report on blood clots or major bleeding. Data for warfarin in comparison with placebo (pretend treatment) were too limited to support the use of warfarin in the prevention of symptomatic blood clots in cancer patients. One study in children evaluated antithrombin, which had no significant effect on any type of blood clots or major bleeding when compared with no antithrombin. 
Quality of the evidence 
The methodological quality of the included studies ranged from low to high, such that future studies may change our confidence in the results, in particular with regard to the safety of anticoagulants. The reliability of the findings ranged from high to very low across the different outcomes and comparisons. The main limiting factors, which were the reason for a decrease in reliability in some outcomes, were imprecision and risk of bias. The relatively low number of studies, participants, and clinical events prevented us from providing more definitive conclusions about the risk of bleeding in association with anticoagulants. None of the studies tested intermittent pneumatic compression (a mechanical device using an air pump and inflatable leggings to provide pulsing pressure that pushes blood through the veins) or graduated elastic stockings (special socks that improve blood flow in the leg veins and prevent blood from pooling in the legs) for the prevention of venous thromboembolism.","# Plain Language Summary: Blood Clot Prevention in Cancer Patients Getting Chemotherapy

## What is this study about?

Cancer patients getting chemotherapy have a higher risk of developing dangerous blood clots in their veins. This review looked at whether giving patients medicine to prevent these blood clots is helpful and safe.

## Why does this matter?

Blood clots can be life-threatening, but the medicines used to prevent them can also cause serious bleeding. Doctors need to know if the benefits of preventing clots are worth the risks of bleeding.

## What did researchers do?

Scientists reviewed 32 different research studies involving 15,678 cancer patients. These studies tested different blood clot prevention medicines compared to placebo (fake medicine) or no treatment.

## What did they find?

**Two types of medicine showed promise:**

1. **LMWH (a type of blood thinner given by injection):** This medicine clearly reduced blood clots compared to no treatment. However, it also increased the risk of serious bleeding.

2. **Direct oral anticoagulants (pills like apixaban and rivaroxaban):** These may reduce blood clots, but the evidence is weaker. They probably increase bleeding risk.

3. **Warfarin (another blood thinner):** Limited evidence suggests it might prevent clots, but it may cause more serious bleeding.

## The Bottom Line

Blood clot prevention medicines can help cancer patients on chemotherapy, but they come with a trade-off: while they reduce clots, they increase the risk of serious bleeding. Doctors and patients need to discuss whether the benefits are worth the risks for each individual.","### Plain Language Summary of the Clinical Trial

#### Purpose of the Study
This study looks at how safe and effective it is to use blood thinners to prevent blood clots in people with cancer who are getting chemotherapy. 

#### Who Was Involved
The study included people with advanced types of cancer, totaling 15,678 participants.

#### What Was Done
Researchers compared different types of blood thinners to see how well they prevent blood clots and how safe they are. They looked at:

- **Direct oral anticoagulants** (like apixaban and rivaroxaban)
- **Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)**
- **Warfarin and aspirin** in some cases
- Other treatments like **antithrombin** in children

#### Key Findings
- **Direct Oral Anticoagulants**: May lower the chance of blood clots but probably increase the risk of serious bleeding.
- **LMWH**: Reduces the chance of blood clots but likely increases serious bleeding.
- **Warfarin and Aspirin**: Warfarin might reduce blood clots but can raise bleeding risk.
- **Antithrombin** in children didn’t clearly show effects on blood clots or bleeding.

#### Safety and Results
- **Direct Oral Anticoagulants**: Risky for bleeding but may help with clots.
- **LMWH**: Helpful in preventing clots but needs careful monitoring for bleeding.
- Overall, more research is needed to better understand these treatments, especially for certain types of cancer.

#### Conclusion
Blood thinner treatments can help prevent blood clots in cancer patients but may also increase bleeding risks. More studies are needed to find the safest and most effective treatments."
"Background
Macrolide antibiotics (macrolides) are among the most commonly prescribed antibiotics worldwide and are used for a wide range of infections. However, macrolides also expose people to the risk of adverse events. The current understanding of adverse events is mostly derived from observational studies, which are subject to bias because it is hard to distinguish events caused by antibiotics from events caused by the diseases being treated. Because adverse events are treatment‐specific, rather than disease‐specific, it is possible to increase the number of adverse events available for analysis by combining randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the same treatment across different diseases. 
Objectives
To quantify the incidences of reported adverse events in people taking macrolide antibiotics compared to placebo for any indication. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialised Register (2018, Issue 4); MEDLINE (Ovid, from 1946 to 8 May 2018); Embase (from 2010 to 8 May 2018); CINAHL (from 1981 to 8 May 2018); LILACS (from 1982 to 8 May 2018); and Web of Science (from 1955 to 8 May 2018). We searched clinical trial registries for current and completed trials (9 May 2018) and checked the reference lists of included studies and of previous Cochrane Reviews on macrolides. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs that compared a macrolide antibiotic to placebo for any indication. We included trials using any of the four most commonly used macrolide antibiotics: azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, or roxithromycin. Macrolides could be administered by any route. Concomitant medications were permitted provided they were equally available to both treatment and comparison groups. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted and collected data. We assessed the risk of bias of all included studies and the quality of evidence for each outcome of interest. We analysed specific adverse events, deaths, and subsequent carriage of macrolide‐resistant bacteria separately. The study participant was the unit of analysis for each adverse event. Any specific adverse events that occurred in 5% or more of any group were reported. We undertook a meta‐analysis when three or more included studies reported a specific adverse event. 
Main results
We included 183 studies with a total of 252,886 participants (range 40 to 190,238). The indications for macrolide antibiotics varied greatly, with most studies using macrolides for the treatment or prevention of either acute respiratory tract infections, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal conditions, or urogynaecological problems. Most trials were conducted in secondary care settings. Azithromycin and erythromycin were more commonly studied than clarithromycin and roxithromycin. 
Most studies (89%) reported some adverse events or at least stated that no adverse events were observed. 
Gastrointestinal adverse events were the most commonly reported type of adverse event. Compared to placebo, macrolides caused more diarrhoea (odds ratio (OR) 1.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 2.16; low‐quality evidence); more abdominal pain (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.26; low‐quality evidence); and more nausea (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.90; moderate‐quality evidence). Vomiting (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.56; moderate‐quality evidence) and gastrointestinal disorders not otherwise specified (NOS) (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.00; moderate‐quality evidence) were also reported more often in participants taking macrolides compared to placebo. 
The number of additional people (absolute difference in risk) who experienced adverse events from macrolides was: gastrointestinal disorders NOS 85/1000; diarrhoea 72/1000; abdominal pain 62/1000; nausea 47/1000; and vomiting 23/1000. 
The number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) ranged from 12 (95% CI 8 to 23) for gastrointestinal disorders NOS to 17 (9 to 47) for abdominal pain; 19 (12 to 33) for diarrhoea; 19 (13 to 30) for nausea; and 45 (22 to 295) for vomiting. 
There was no clear consistent difference in gastrointestinal adverse events between different types of macrolides or route of administration. 
Taste disturbances were reported more often by participants taking macrolide antibiotics, although there were wide confidence intervals and moderate heterogeneity (OR 4.95, 95% CI 1.64 to 14.93; I² = 46%; low‐quality evidence). 
Compared with participants taking placebo, those taking macrolides experienced hearing loss more often, however only four studies reported this outcome (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.70; I² = 0%; low‐quality evidence). 
We did not find any evidence that macrolides caused more cardiac disorders (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.40; very low‐quality evidence); hepatobiliary disorders (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.27 to 4.09; very low‐quality evidence); or changes in liver enzymes (OR 1.56, 95% CI 0.73 to 3.37; very low‐quality evidence) compared to placebo. 
We did not find any evidence that appetite loss, dizziness, headache, respiratory symptoms, blood infections, skin and soft tissue infections, itching, or rashes were reported more often by participants treated with macrolides compared to placebo. 
Macrolides caused less cough (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.80; moderate‐quality evidence) and fewer respiratory tract infections (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.80; moderate‐quality evidence) compared to placebo, probably because these are not adverse events, but rather characteristics of the indications for the antibiotics. Less fever (OR 0.73, 95% 0.54 to 1.00; moderate‐quality evidence) was also reported by participants taking macrolides compared to placebo, although these findings were non‐significant. 
There was no increase in mortality in participants taking macrolides compared with placebo (OR 0.96, 95% 0.87 to 1.06; I² = 11%; low‐quality evidence). 
Only 24 studies (13%) provided useful data on macrolide‐resistant bacteria. Macrolide‐resistant bacteria were more commonly identified among participants immediately after exposure to the antibiotic. However, differences in resistance thereafter were inconsistent. 
Pharmaceutical companies supplied the trial medication or funding, or both, for 91 trials. 
Authors' conclusions
The macrolides as a group clearly increased rates of gastrointestinal adverse events. Most trials made at least some statement about adverse events, such as ""none were observed"". However, few trials clearly listed adverse events as outcomes, reported on the methods used for eliciting adverse events, or even detailed the numbers of people who experienced adverse events in both the intervention and placebo group. This was especially true for the adverse event of bacterial resistance.","Adverse events in people taking macrolide antibiotics
Review question 
We wanted to find out if people treated with a macrolide antibiotic experienced more adverse events than those treated with placebo. 
Background 
Macrolide antibiotics are a group of antibiotics that are commonly used to treat both acute and chronic infections. The four most frequently used macrolides are: azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, and roxithromycin. People taking macrolide antibiotics are at risk of experiencing adverse events such as nausea, diarrhoea, or rash. 
Search date 
We searched the literature up to May 2018.
Study characteristics 
We included 183 studies with a total of 252,886 participants. Most studies were conducted in the hospital setting. Azithromycin and erythromycin were more commonly studied than clarithromycin and roxithromycin. Most studies (89%) reported some adverse events, or at least stated that no adverse events were observed. 
Study funding sources 
Drug companies supplied trial medications or funding, or both, in 91 studies. Funding sources were unclear in 59 studies. 
Key results 
People treated with a macrolide antibiotic experienced gastrointestinal adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea more often than those treated with placebo. 
Taste disturbances were reported more often by people taking macrolides than those taking a placebo. However, as very few studies reported on these adverse events, these results should be interpreted with caution. 
Hearing loss was reported more often by people taking macrolide antibiotics, however only four studies reported this outcome. 
Macrolides caused less cough and fewer respiratory tract infections than placebo.
We did not find any evidence that macrolides caused more cardiac disorders, liver disorders, blood infections, skin and soft tissue infections, changes in liver enzymes, appetite loss, dizziness, headache, respiratory symptoms, itching, or rashes than placebo. 
We did not find more deaths in people treated with macrolides than in those treated with placebo. 
Very limited information was available to assess if people treated with a macrolide antibiotic were at greater risk of developing resistant bacteria than those treated with placebo. However, bacteria that did not respond to macrolide antibiotics were more commonly identified immediately after treatment in people taking a macrolide than in those taking a placebo, but differences in resistance thereafter were inconsistent. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence ranged from very low (cardiac disorders, change in liver enzymes, liver disorders) to low (abdominal pain, death, diarrhoea, dizziness, hearing loss, skin and soft tissue infections, taste disturbance, wheeze) to moderate (appetite loss, blood infection, cough, fever, headache, itching, nausea, rash, respiratory symptoms, respiratory tract infections, vomiting).","# Plain Language Summary: Macrolide Antibiotics and Side Effects

## What is this study about?

Macrolide antibiotics are common medicines used to treat infections. Scientists wanted to find out what side effects people experience when taking these antibiotics compared to a fake medicine (placebo).

## Why does this matter?

It's hard to know if side effects come from the antibiotic or from the infection being treated. By looking at many studies together, researchers can get a clearer picture of which side effects are actually caused by the medicine.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at 183 studies involving 252,886 people. They searched for studies that compared four common macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, and roxithromycin) to placebo. The studies covered people being treated for various infections, including respiratory infections, heart problems, and stomach issues.

## What did they find?

**Stomach and digestive side effects were most common:**
- More diarrhea
- More stomach pain
- More nausea
- More vomiting
- More general digestive problems

**Other side effects:**
- Taste problems (though this was less common)
- Hearing loss (though only a few studies reported this)

**Good news:**
- No increase in heart problems
- No increase in liver problems
- No increase in deaths
- Fewer coughs and respiratory infections (because the antibiotics were working)

**Bacterial resistance:**
Only a few studies tracked whether bacteria became resistant to the antibiotics after treatment.

## Bottom line

Macrolide antibiotics do cause stomach and digestive side effects more often than placebo, but serious side effects are uncommon.","### Plain-Language Summary of the Study on Macrolide Antibiotics

#### Purpose of the Study
This study looked at how often side effects happen in people taking certain antibiotics called macrolides, which are used to treat many infections. The researchers wanted to compare these side effects to those in people taking a placebo (a fake treatment).

#### Who Was Studied
A total of 183 smaller studies were looked at, with 252,886 people participating. These studies focused on people using macrolides for various health issues like breathing problems, heart issues, stomach, or women's health problems.

#### What Was Done
The main types of macrolide antibiotics studied were azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, and roxithromycin. Researchers checked for side effects like stomach problems and compared them to those seen in people not taking the real drug.

#### Key Findings
- **Common Side Effects:** People taking macrolides had more stomach issues like diarrhea, stomach pain, and nausea compared to those taking a placebo.
- **Other Effects:** Some people reported taste changes and, a few studies noted, hearing loss.
- **No Increase in Some Problems:** The study didn’t find more heart, liver, or general skin problems in people taking macrolides compared to a placebo.
- **Positive Effects:** Those taking macrolides had less coughing and fewer breathing infections, likely because the antibiotics were working.
- **Bacteria Resistance:** Some people had germs that didn’t respond to the antibiotics after use, but it varied over time.

#### Safety and Funding
Most studies said something about side effects, but not all were very detailed. Some studies were helped by drug companies.

#### Conclusion
Macrolide antibiotics can cause more stomach problems compared to fake treatments, but they help reduce cough and infections. More research is needed to understand antibiotic resistance better.

This helps us know more about the safety of these common antibiotics."
"Background
Despite efforts to preserve the neurovascular bundles with nerve‐sparing surgery, erectile dysfunction remains common following radical prostatectomy. Postoperative penile rehabilitation seeks to restore erectile function but results have been conflicting. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of penile rehabilitation strategies in restoring erectile function following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive search of multiple databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase), the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) and a grey literature repository (Grey Literature Report) from their inception through to 3 January 2018. We also searched the reference lists of other relevant publications and abstract proceedings. We applied no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised or quasi‐randomised trials with a parallel or cross‐over design.
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Two review authors independently screened the literature, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and rated quality of evidence according to GRADE on a per‐outcome basis. Primary outcomes were self‐reported potency, erectile function measured by validated questionnaires (with potency defined as an International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF‐EF) score of 19 or greater and or an IIEF‐5 of score of 17 or greater) and serious adverse events. For all quality of life assessments on a continuous scale, higher values indicated better quality of life. 
Main results
We included eight randomised controlled trials with 1699 participants across three comparisons. This abstract focuses on the primary outcomes of this review only. 
Scheduled phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5I) versus placebo or no treatment 
Scheduled PDE5I may have little or no effect on short‐term (up to 12 months) self‐reported potency (risk ratio (RR) 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to1.41; very low quality evidence), which corresponds to 47 more men with self‐reported potency per 1000 (95% CI 33 fewer to 149 more) and short‐term erectile function as assessed by a validated instrument (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.55; very low quality evidence), which corresponds to 28 more men per 1000 (95% CI 50 fewer to 138 more), but we are very uncertain of both of these findings. Scheduled PDE5I may result in fewer serious adverse events compared to placebo (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.94; low quality evidence), though this does not appear biologically plausible and may represent a chance finding. We are also very uncertain of this finding. We found no long‐term (longer than 12 months) data for any of the three primary outcomes. 
Scheduled PDE5I versus on‐demand PDE5I 
Daily PDE5I appears to result in little to no difference in both short‐term and long‐term (greater than 12 months) self‐reported potency (short term: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.53; long term: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.67; both very low quality evidence); this corresponds to nine fewer men with self‐reported short‐term potency per 1000 (95% CI 119 fewer to 166 more) and zero fewer men with self‐reported long‐term potency per 1000 (95% CI 153 fewer to 257 more). We are very uncertain of these findings. Daily PDE5I appears to result in little to no difference in short‐term and long‐term erectile function (short term: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.55; long term; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.14; both very‐low quality evidence), which corresponds to zero men with short‐term erectile dysfunction per 1000 (95% CI 80 fewer to 125 more) and 119 fewer men with long‐term erectile dysfunction per 1000 (95% CI 239 fewer to 64 more). We are very uncertain of these findings. Scheduled PDE5I may result in little or no effects on short‐term adverse events (RR 0.69 95% CI 0.12 to 4.04; very low quality evidence), which corresponds to seven fewer men with short‐term serious adverse events (95% CI 18 fewer to 64 more), but we are very uncertain of these findings. We found no long‐term data for serious adverse events. 
Scheduled PDE5I versus scheduled intraurethral prostaglandin E1 
At short‐term follow‐up, daily PDE5I may result in little or no effect on self‐reported potency (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.79, to 1.52; very low quality evidence), which corresponds to 46 more men per 1000 (95% CI 97 fewer to 241 more). Daily PDE5I may result in a small improvement of erectile function (RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.84 to 3.20; very low quality evidence), which corresponds to 92 more men per 1000 (95% CI 23 fewer to 318 more) but we are very uncertain of both these findings. We found no long‐term (longer than 12 months) data for any of the three primary outcomes. 
We found no evidence for any other comparisons and were unable to perform any of the preplanned subgroup analyses based on nerve‐sparing approach, age or baseline erectile function. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on mostly very‐low and some low‐quality evidence, penile rehabilitation strategies consisting of scheduled PDE5I use following radical prostatectomy may not promote self‐reported potency and erectile function any more than on demand use.","Penile rehabilitation for post prostatectomy erectile dysfunction
Review question 
How well do treatments work to restore men's ability to have erections after surgery for prostate cancer? 
Background 
Many men have problems with erections after having their prostate removed for prostate cancer. Studies suggest that taking certain medicines or using devices to help with erection may help men's erections recover faster and better when used on a regular, scheduled basis (like daily or twice a week) rather than as needed. However, it is unclear how well these treatments actually work. 
Study characteristics 
We included eight randomised studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 1699 participants. Five trials compared the scheduled use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors (a type of medicine) to either no treatment or a placebo (a pretend drug with no effect). Two studies compared the use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors either as a daily prescription or as needed. One study compared the daily use of either a phosphodiesterase inhibitor or a medicine called prostaglandin E1 that is placed into the tip of the penis like a suppository. The main outcomes of this review that we felt were most important to men were how good they thought their erections were (self‐reported potency), how good their erections were based on a specialised erection questionnaire (quality of erections) and any whether there were any major unwanted side effects. 
Key results 
We found that the men who used these medicines on a scheduled basis may have had similar self‐reported erections and quality of erections (based on questionnaires they filled out) as men who took no medication regularly or use it as needed. They also had similar rates of serious unwanted side effects and similar rates of stopping the drug before the end of the treatment duration. However, we are very uncertain of these findings. We were unable to research whether these results would be different in different groups of men based on whether the surgeon tried to preserve the nerves that help with erections or not, based on men's age and how good their erections were beforehand because we found no studies. 
Reliability of evidence 
The quality of evidence was very low for most main outcomes. That means we are very uncertain of the results of this review. Further research will likely change these findings.","# Plain Language Summary: Penile Rehabilitation After Prostate Surgery

## What is this study about?

Men who have surgery to remove their prostate (a gland in the male reproductive system) sometimes have trouble with erectile function afterward. This review looked at whether special treatments given after surgery—called ""penile rehabilitation""—can help restore normal function.

## Who participated?

The review included 8 research studies with a total of 1,699 men who had prostate surgery.

## What treatments were tested?

Researchers compared three main approaches:

1. **Taking a daily pill** (a type of erectile dysfunction medication) versus taking nothing or a fake pill
2. **Taking a daily pill** versus taking the pill only when needed
3. **Taking a daily pill** versus using a different type of treatment (a medication inserted into the urethra)

## What did they find?

**Main results:**

- Taking a daily pill did **not appear to help** men recover erectile function better than taking nothing or taking it only when needed
- The daily pill approach did **not show clear advantages** over the other methods tested
- Serious side effects were rare in all groups

## Important notes

- The quality of evidence was **very low to low**, meaning researchers are **not very confident** in these findings
- Most studies only followed men for up to 12 months after surgery
- Researchers could not compare results based on patient age or other important factors

## Bottom line

Based on current research, taking a daily erectile dysfunction pill after prostate surgery may not work better than taking it only when needed.","### Plain Language Summary

**Purpose of the Study**
This study looked at ways to help men regain their ability to have erections after prostate surgery for cancer. The researchers wanted to see if certain treatments could help with this problem.

**Who Was Studied**
The study included men who had surgery for prostate cancer, involving a total of 1,699 people across several smaller studies.

**What Was Tested**
Different treatments were tested to see if they helped men regain their ability to have erections:

1. **Daily Pills vs. No Treatment**: One group took a daily pill (PDE5I), while another group either took no pill or a fake pill.

2. **Daily Pills vs. Pills as Needed**: Men taking the daily pill were compared to those taking the pill only when needed.

3. **Daily Pills vs. Another Medication**: The daily pill was compared to a different kind of treatment (a drug placed inside the urethra).

**What They Found**
- **Daily Pills vs. No Treatment**: Taking the daily pill might not make a big difference in improving erections within one year after surgery. There were slightly fewer serious side effects with the pill, but this may not have been due to the pill itself.

- **Daily Pills vs. Pills as Needed**: There was little difference between taking the pill daily or only when needed, both in the short term and long term. Serious side effects were similar.

- **Daily Pills vs. Another Medication**: The daily pill might make a small improvement in erections compared to the other treatment, but evidence was not clear.

**Safety and Side Effects**
Overall, there were not many serious side effects reported for any treatment. Information on long-term effects is still lacking.

**Conclusion**
Taking a daily pill after prostate surgery might not be better than taking it only when needed in helping men regain erections. More research is needed for clearer answers.

**Note**: This summary is based on the results available, which were mostly from low-quality studies. Further studies are necessary for more reliable information."
"Background
Surgery for anorectal fistula may result in recurrence, or impairment of continence. The ideal treatment for anorectal fistulae should be associated with low recurrence rates, minimal incontinence and good quality of life. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and morbidity of operative procedures for chronic anal fistula, primary outcomes being recurrence and incontinence. 
Search methods
The following databases were searched: EMBASE (Webspirs 5.1, Silver Platter version 2.0, 1950‐2009); Medline (Webspirs 5.1, Silver Platter version 2.0, 1950‐2009); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2009 issue 4)and the IndMed ( Indian Medline, www.indmed.nic.in) database. We restricted our search to the English literature. The Indian Journal of Surgery was electronically searched (issues between 2003 and vol 71, Oct 2009). We also searched all primary trial registers (Indian, Australian, Chinese, WHO, ISRCTN and American). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing operative procedures for anorectal fistulae were considered. Non randomised trials and cohort studies were examined where data on recurrence and function were available. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers (TJ and BP) independently selected the trials for inclusion in the review. Disagreements were solved by discussion. Where disagreement persisted and published results made data extraction difficult, we obtained clarification from the authors. REVMAN 5 was used for statistical analysis. Quality of the trials were assessed and allowances made for subgroup analysis and prevention of publication bias, using funnel plots if needed. 
Main results
Ten randomised controlled trials were available for analysis. The quality of included studies was adequate, though in some trials the numbers were small and they were inadequately powered for equivalence or to detect significant differences. Comparisons were made between various modalities of treatments. There were no significant difference in recurrence rates or incontinence rates in any of the studied comparisons except in the case of advancement flaps. There were more recurrences in the glue plus flap group, a significant difference that favoured the flap only technique. It was also noted that Fibrin glue and advancement flap procedures report low incontinence rates.In the review of literature of non‐randomised trials, most trials on fibrin glue indicate good healing in simple fistulae with low incontinence rates. 
Authors' conclusions
There are very few randomized controlled trials comparing the various modalities of surgery for fistula in ano. While post operative pain, time to healing and discharge from hospital affect quality of life, recurrence and incontinence are the most important. As it turns out, there seems to be no major difference between the various techniques used as far as recurrence rates are concerned. 
The use of Fibrin glue and advancement flaps are associated with low incontinence rates. 
There is a crying need for well powered, well conducted randomised controlled trials comparing various modes of treatment of fistula in ano. Newer operations like the anal fistula plug and the LIFT procedure need to be evaluated by randomised clinical trials.","No major difference between the various surgical interventions for Anorectal fistula used as far as recurrence rates are concerned. 
Anorectal fistula is a common surgical problem. The anorectal fistula can be treated by various surgical options. The common surgical options for rectal fistulae are  a) to lay open the fistula tract (fistulotomy), or  b) to pass a seton (a thread, wire or tube that stimulates the body to extrude it and ultimately heal the fistula), or  c) to primarily remove the fistula (fistulectomy) and repair the defect in the muscle and the anus with an anorectal myo‐mucosal advancement flap.  Other treatment modalities used less frequently include fibrin glue and ayurvedic drugs incorporated into setons. The optimal surgical treatment for anorectal fistulae is associated with low recurrence rates, minimal incontinence and a good quality of life. 
The reviewers identified 10 trials that compare various fistula treatments against one another. There are various parameters that these procedures can be compared on, but we looked at the two most important ones, recurrence (the numbers who got the disease again) and incontinence (a worsening in the ability to control rectal content). 
In the trials that were compared, there was no significant difference between the various comparisons for the disease to recur. However the trials on fibrin glue, as well as data from non randomised trials show that incontinence is less, probably as there is no surgical disruption of the anal muscle. 
There is a paucity of good quality data that compares various types of operative treatment for anorectal fistula and there is scope for further trials in the area.","# Plain Language Summary: Surgery for Anal Fistula

## What is this study about?

This study reviewed research on different surgical treatments for anal fistula (a small tunnel that forms near the anus). The goal was to find out which surgery works best and causes the fewest problems.

## Why does this matter?

Surgery for anal fistula can sometimes cause problems. The fistula may come back, or patients may have trouble controlling bowel movements. Doctors want to find the best surgery that prevents these problems and helps people feel better.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at 10 studies that compared different types of surgery for anal fistula. They searched medical databases from 1950 to 2009 and looked at studies from around the world. They compared how well different surgeries worked and what side effects patients had.

## What did they find?

- Most surgery types had similar rates of the fistula coming back
- Two types of surgery—fibrin glue with flaps and advancement flaps alone—caused fewer problems with bowel control
- Using fibrin glue with flaps caused more fistulas to come back compared to flaps alone

## What do the researchers say?

The researchers found that most surgeries work about the same way. However, fibrin glue and advancement flaps are gentler on bowel control. They say more high-quality studies are needed to compare newer surgery types and find the very best treatment.","### Plain Language Summary

#### What is This Study About?

This study looks at different types of surgeries used to treat a condition called anorectal fistula. Doctors want to find good treatments that don’t often come back and help people continue to go to the bathroom normally.

#### What Did the Study Do?

Researchers looked at different reports and studies to learn about surgeries for anorectal fistula. They focused on whether these surgeries were successful and didn’t cause people to lose control over their bowels.

#### How Did They Do It?

They searched for studies done from 1950 to 2009 in various scientific libraries and databases. They mainly looked at high-quality studies where people were chosen randomly to receive different types of surgeries.

#### What Did They Find?

- They found ten good studies comparing different surgeries.
- Most treatments had similar rates of fistulas coming back.
- In one case, using glue with an advancement flap led to more fistulas coming back compared to using just the flap.
- Surgeries using Fibrin glue and advancement flaps were linked with low problems in bowel control.
- Fibrin glue was effective in simpler cases with fewer side effects.

#### What Do These Results Mean?

The study concluded that while different surgeries work similarly well, there's a need for more research. This would help determine which new surgeries, like the anal fistula plug and LIFT procedure, might be better.

#### Why Is This Important?

Finding the best surgical methods could help people feel better and avoid future problems with anorectal fistula. More research is needed to find the most effective techniques."
"Background
Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Amnioinfusion aims to restore amniotic fluid volume by infusing a solution into the uterine cavity. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the effects of amnioinfusion for PPROM on perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (2 December 2013). 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials of amnioinfusion compared with no amnioinfusion in women with PPROM.
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. 
Main results
We included five trials, of moderate quality, but we only analysed data from four studies (with a total of 241 participants). One trial did not contribute any data to the review. 
Transcervical amnioinfusion improved fetal umbilical artery pH at delivery (mean difference 0.11; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.14; one trial, 61 participants) and reduced persistent variable decelerations during labour (risk ratio (RR) 0.52; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.91; one trial, 86 participants). 
Transabdominal amnioinfusion was associated with a reduction in neonatal death (RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.66; two trials, 94 participants), neonatal sepsis (RR 0.26; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.61; one trial, 60 participants), pulmonary hypoplasia (RR 0.22; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.88; one trial, 34 participants) and puerperal sepsis (RR 0.20; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.84; one trial, 60 participants). Women in the amnioinfusion group were also less likely to deliver within seven days of membrane rupture (RR 0.18; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.70; one trial, 34 participants). These results should be treated with circumspection as the positive findings were mainly due to one trial with unclear allocation concealment. 
Authors' conclusions
These results are encouraging but are limited by the sparse data and unclear methodological robustness, therefore further evidence is required before amnioinfusion for PPROM can be recommended for routine clinical practice.","Amnioinfusion for preterm premature rupture of membranes
There is some evidence to show that restoring amniotic fluid volume with saline or a similar fluid (amnioinfusion) following preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM) may be beneficial for preterm babies (by preventing infection, lung damage and death) and mothers (by preventing infection of the womb after childbirth). However, current evidence is insufficient to recommend amnioinfusion for routine use in PPROM. 
Preterm premature rupture of membranes is the single most identifiable cause of preterm labour. The sac (membranes) surrounding the baby and fluid in the womb (uterus) usually breaks (ruptures) during labour. If the membranes rupture before labour and preterm (before 37 weeks) the baby has an increased risk of infection. Reduced fluid around the baby also increases the chance of the umbilical cord being compressed, which can reduce the baby's supply of nutrients and oxygen. In addition, insufficient fluid in the womb may interfere with normal lung development in very small babies and can cause fetal distress, with changes in heart rate. Extra liquid can be injected through the woman's vagina (transcervical amnioinfusion) or abdomen (transabdominal amnioinfusion) into the womb, providing more liquid to surround the baby. The review of five randomised controlled trials (with data from a total of 241 participants analysed) found some evidence to show that amnioinfusion with a saline solution may improve health outcomes and be beneficial for babies and mothers following PPROM. However, the evidence is currently insufficient to recommend its routine use because of the limited number of trials and low numbers of women in the trials.","# Plain Language Summary: Amnioinfusion for Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes

## What is this study about?

This review looked at a medical procedure called amnioinfusion to treat a pregnancy complication where the amniotic sac breaks open too early (before 37 weeks of pregnancy). Amnioinfusion involves putting fluid into the uterus to replace the lost amniotic fluid.

## Why is this important?

When the amniotic sac breaks early, it can cause serious problems for the baby and mother. Researchers wanted to know if adding fluid back into the uterus could help prevent these problems.

## What did researchers do?

Scientists reviewed five previous studies that compared amnioinfusion to no treatment in pregnant women with this complication. They looked at data from four of these studies, which included 241 women total.

## What did they find?

**Two types of amnioinfusion were tested:**

**Type 1 (through the cervix):**
- Babies had better blood oxygen levels at birth
- Fewer babies had abnormal heart rate patterns during labor

**Type 2 (through the abdomen):**
- Fewer newborn deaths
- Fewer infections in newborns and mothers
- Fewer lung development problems in babies
- Women were less likely to deliver within a week of the rupture

## Important note

The researchers said these results look promising, but the studies were small and had some quality concerns. More research is needed before doctors can recommend this treatment as standard care.","### Study Summary: Amnioinfusion for Early Water Breakage During Pregnancy

**Background:**
Early water breakage during pregnancy can lead to health problems for both the mother and baby. Amnioinfusion is a treatment that involves adding fluid to the uterus.

**Purpose:**
The study looked at whether amnioinfusion helps improve health outcomes for mothers and babies when water breaks early.

**Methods:**
Researchers reviewed different studies that tested amnioinfusion versus no treatment in pregnant women who experienced early water breakage. They gathered data from four studies with 241 participants in total.

**Findings:**
- **Umbilical Artery pH Improvement:** Babies had a slightly better condition at birth in one of the studies.
- **Labour Complications:** There were fewer signs of distress in babies during labor in the group that received amnioinfusion.
- **Neonatal Outcomes:** There was a decrease in baby deaths, infections, and lung problems with this treatment.
- **Delivery Timing:** Women who received amnioinfusion were less likely to give birth within a week after their water broke.

**Conclusion:**
The results seem promising, but more research is needed because there isn't enough strong evidence yet to recommend amnioinfusion as a standard treatment for early water breakage."
"Background
Domestic violence during pregnancy is a major public health concern. This preventable risk factor threatens both the mother and baby. Routine perinatal care visits offer opportunities for healthcare professionals to screen and refer abused women for effective interventions. It is, however, not clear which interventions best serve mothers during pregnancy and postpartum to ensure their safety. 
Objectives
To examine the effectiveness and safety of interventions in preventing or reducing domestic violence against pregnant women. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 July 2014), scanned bibliographies of published studies and corresponded with investigators. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including cluster‐randomised trials, and quasi‐randomised controlled trials (e.g. where there was alternate allocation) investigating the effect of interventions in preventing or reducing domestic violence during pregnancy. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. 
Main results
We included 10 trials with a total of 3417 women randomised. Seven of these trials, recruiting 2629 women, contributed data to the review. However, results for all outcomes were based on single studies. There was limited evidence for the primary outcomes of reduction of episodes of violence (physical, sexual, and/or psychological) and prevention of violence during and up to one year after pregnancy (as defined by the authors of trials). In one study, women who received the intervention reported fewer episodes of partner violence during pregnancy and in the postpartum period (risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 0.88, 306 women, moderate quality). Groups did not differ for Conflict Tactics Score ‐ the mean partner abuse scores in the first three months postpartum (mean difference (MD) 4.20 higher, 95% CI ‐10.74 to 19.14, one study, 46 women, very low quality). The Current Abuse Score for partner abuse in the first three months was also similar between groups (MD ‐0.12 lower, 95% CI ‐0.31 lower to 0.07 higher, one study, 191 women, very low quality). Evidence for the outcomes episodes of partner abuse during pregnancy or episodes during the first three months postpartum was not significant (respectively, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.02, one study with 220 women, very low quality; and RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.04, one study, 271 women, very low quality). Finally, the risk for low birthweight (< 2500 g) did not differ between groups (RR 0.74, 95 % CI 0.41 to 1.32, 306 infants, low quality). 
There were few statistically significant differences between intervention and control groups for depression during pregnancy and the postnatal period. Only one study reported findings for neonatal outcomes such as preterm delivery and birthweight, and there were no clinically significant differences between groups. None of the studies reported results for other secondary outcomes: Apgar score less than seven at one minute and five minutes, stillbirth, neonatal death, miscarriage, maternal mortality, antepartum haemorrhage, and placental abruption. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of interventions for domestic violence on pregnancy outcomes. There is a need for high‐quality, RCTs with adequate statistical power to determine whether intervention programs prevent or reduce domestic violence episodes during pregnancy, or have any effect on maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity outcomes.","Preventing or reducing partner violence against women during pregnancy
Violence against women by partners during pregnancy is a major public health concern. It can cause physical and psychological harm to women and may lead to pregnancy complications and poor outcomes for babies. It is not clear what sort of intervention best serves women and infants during pregnancy and after giving birth to ensure their safety. Interventions that might work include counselling and psychological therapy to give women more confidence and to encourage them to make plans to avoid abuse. Referral to social workers, shelters and other community‐based resources may also help. For partners, referral can be made to 'batterer' treatment programs.   
Routine prenatal care offers opportunities for healthcare staff to identify women at risk of being abused. In this review we included 10 randomised trials involving a total of 3417 women, seven of which studied pregnant women who were at high risk of partner violence. The interventions examined in the studies included a single brief individualised consultation, case management and referral to a social care worker, and multiple therapy sessions during pregnancy and after birth. Due to the lack of data, and the different way outcomes were reported, we were unable to identify interventions that worked better than others. Studies focused on different outcomes and we were not able to pool information to draw conclusions about the overall effectiveness of the interventions. Most of the studies did not report on whether or not there had been any reduction in episodes of violence. There was evidence from a single study that the total number of women reporting partner violence during pregnancy and after birth was reduced for women receiving a psychological therapy intervention. Several of the studies examined whether women who received interventions were less likely to have depression after the birth of the baby, but the evidence was not consistent. Other outcomes for the baby such as reduced birthweight and preterm birth were reported in only one study, and the intervention did not lessen the risk of preterm birth (< 2500 g). None of the studies reported results for important outcomes such as stillbirth, neonatal death, miscarriage, maternal deaths, antepartum haemorrhage, and placental abruption. More information is needed from well‐conducted trials before any particular interventional approach can be recommended.","# Plain Language Summary: Domestic Violence Prevention During Pregnancy

## What is this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out which programs or treatments work best to help pregnant women who experience domestic violence (abuse from a partner). They looked at 10 different studies involving 3,417 women to see if these programs could reduce or prevent abuse during pregnancy and after the baby is born.

## Who was involved?

The studies included pregnant women who were experiencing domestic violence from their partners.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers reviewed studies that tested different interventions (programs or treatments) to help prevent or reduce domestic violence during pregnancy and up to one year after birth. They looked at whether these programs actually worked and whether they helped keep mothers and babies safe.

## What did they find?

The results were mixed and limited:

- **One study** showed that women who received help reported fewer incidents of partner violence during pregnancy and after birth.
- **Other measures** of abuse (like specific scoring tests) showed similar results between women who received help and those who didn't.
- **Baby health**: There were no major differences in low birthweight babies between the two groups.
- **Depression**: There were few differences in depression rates between groups.
- **Other outcomes**: The studies didn't provide enough information about premature birth, stillbirth, or other serious complications.

## Bottom line

There isn't enough strong evidence yet to say which programs work best for preventing domestic violence during pregnancy. Researchers say we need better, larger studies to find out if these programs actually reduce abuse and improve health for mothers and babies.","### Plain Language Summary

**Background**

Domestic violence during pregnancy is a big concern for mothers and babies. Doctors can help by checking for abuse when pregnant women visit. It's important to find the best ways to keep mothers safe before and after the baby is born.

**Objective**

This study looked at how effective and safe different methods are in stopping or reducing domestic violence against pregnant women. 

**Study Details**

Researchers searched for various studies done up until July 2014. They chose studies that tested methods to reduce domestic violence during pregnancy. 

**What They Did**

Two researchers checked each study to make sure it was good quality. They collected and carefully reviewed the data from these studies.

**Main Findings**

They looked at 10 studies with a total of 3,417 women. Out of these, 7 studies had useful data.

- One study showed that women who got help had fewer reports of being hurt by their partners during and after pregnancy.
- In terms of how often violence happened, the results were not strong or clear.
- The studies did not show a big difference in the baby's birth weight between groups.
- The impact on depression and baby health, like early birth and weight, showed no major differences.

**Conclusion**

There isn't enough strong evidence to say for sure what works best to help prevent domestic violence during pregnancy. Better studies are needed to find out which programs really help keep mothers and babies safe."
"Background
Embryo transfer (ET) was traditionally performed two days after oocyte retrieval; however, developments in culture media have allowed embryos to be maintained in culture for longer periods. Delaying transfer from Day two to Day three would allow for further development of the embryo and might have a positive effect on pregnancy outcomes. 
Objectives
To determine if there are any differences in live birth and pregnancy rates when embryo transfer is performed on day three after oocyte retrieval, compared with day two, in infertile couples undergoing treatment with in vitro fertilisation (IVF), including intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid) from the inception of the databases to 26th April 2016. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO portal for ongoing trials plus citation lists of relevant publications, review articles and included studies, as well as abstracts of appropriate scientific meetings. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials that compared Day 3 versus Day 2 embryo transfer after oocyte retrieval during an IVF or ICSI treatment cycle in infertile couples. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. The primary outcome measures were live birth rate and ongoing pregnancy rate. 
Main results
We included 15 studies. Fourteen studies reported data per woman (2894 women) and one study reported data per cycle (969 cycles). The quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach ranged from moderate quality to very low quality. The main reasons for downgrading evidence were poor methodological reporting, selective reporting, inconsistency and imprecision. 
Live birth per woman ‐ Overall, there was no evidence of a difference in live birth rate between Day three and Day two embryo transfer (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.23; three studies, n = 1200 women; I2 = 63%; very low quality evidence). The data suggest that if 32% of women who underwent a Day two embryo transfer had a live birth, then between 28% to 39% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have a live birth. 
Ongoing pregnancy per woman ‐ There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for ongoing pregnancy (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.12; six studies, n = 1740 women; I2 = 52%; very low quality of evidence). The data suggest that if 33% of women undergoing a Day two embryo transfer had an ongoing pregnancy then between 28% to 37% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have an ongoing pregnancy. 
Clinical pregnancy per woman ‐ There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for the chance of a clinical pregnancy (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.19; 12 studies, n = 2461, I2 = 51%; very low quality evidence). The data suggest that if 39% of women undergoing Day two embryo transfer had a clinical pregnancy, then between 38% to 46% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have a clinical pregnancy. 
Multiple pregnancy per woman ‐ There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for the risk of a multiple pregnancy (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.44; eight studies, n = 1837; I2 = 0%; moderate quality evidence). The data suggest that if 11% of women undergoing Day two embryo transfer had a multiple pregnancy, then between 9% to 15% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have a multiple pregnancy. 
Miscarriage rate per woman ‐ There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for the risk of miscarriage (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.60; nine studies, n = 2153 women, I2 = 26%; moderate quality evidence). The data suggest that if 6% of women undergoing Day two embryo transfer had a miscarriage, then between 5% to 10% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have a miscarriage. 
Ectopic pregnancy rate per woman ‐ There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for the risk of ectopic pregnancy (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.29 to 3.40; six studies, n = 1531 women, I2 = 0%; low quality evidence). The data suggest that if 0.7% of women undergoing Day two embryo transfer have an ectopic pregnancy, then between 0.2% to 2% of women undergoing Day three embryo transfer would have an ectopic pregnancy. 
Subgroup analysis for pregnancy outcomes did not identify any differential effect between IVF and ICSI. 
None of the included studies prespecified complication rate (e.g. OHSS), fetal abnormality or women's evaluation of the procedure as outcomes in their studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Twelve of 15 studies contributed data that could be included in meta‐analyses. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. Only three of the 15 studies reported data for live birth, although the data for ongoing pregnancy and clinical pregnancy are consistent with the live birth data, suggesting no difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for these outcomes. There was no evidence of a difference identified between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for multiple pregnancy, miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy per woman randomised. No data were reported for complication rate, fetal abnormality or woman's evaluation of the procedure. The current evidence has not identified any evidence of differences in pregnancy outcomes between Day two and Day three embryo transfers. Any further studies comparing these timings of embryo transfer are unlikely to alter the findings and we suggest that this review no longer be updated.","Day three versus day two embryo transfer following in vitro fertilisation or intracytoplasmic sperm injection 
Review question 
Cochrane review authors investigated whether transferring an embryo on Day two or on Day three of development makes a difference to pregnancy outcomes in women having in vitro fertilisation or intracytoplasmic sperm injection. 
Background 
Embryo transfer has usually been performed two days after oocyte (egg) retrieval; however, developments in culture media and embryo culture methods have allowed embryos to be maintained in culture for longer periods. This means that more assessments can be undertaken to look at the implantation chances for each embryo. Delaying transfer from Day two to Day three would allow for further development of the embryo and might have a positive effect on pregnancy outcomes. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 15 randomised trials meeting the review inclusion criteria. These include 14 trials reporting data from 2894 women; one trial reported data from 969 cycles so could not be included in meta‐analysis. All of the included studies were parallel‐design randomised controlled trials conducted in Brazil, Chile, Singapore, Argentina, Finland, Turkey, Spain, Israel, Canada, Greece, Japan, Italy, Norway and Belgium. The evidence is current to April 2016. 
Key results 
Only three of 15 studies reported on live birth as an outcome. We found that there was no clear evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for rates of live birth, ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy or miscarriage. There were no data reported for complication rate, fetal abnormality or women's evaluation of the procedure. 
Quality of the evidence 
Allocation concealment was poorly reported in the included studies and blinding was not possible (although we feel this is unlikely to affect pregnancy outcomes). Blinding of outcome assessors was not reported. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. The main reasons for downgrading the evidence were poor reporting of study methods (risk of bias), lack of agreement between studies (inconsistency), low event rates and lack of accuracy (imprecision) for some outcomes and poor reporting of live birth outcomes (selective reporting). 
Any further studies comparing these timings of embryo transfer are unlikely to alter the findings and we do not plan to update this review again. Many of the trials included in this review have used outdated techniques that include stimulation, laboratory technology and transferring more than one embryo. We would direct the reader to the Glujovsky 2016 Cochrane review comparing Day 2/3 with day 5/6 embryo transfer.","# Plain Language Summary: When Should Embryos Be Transferred During IVF?

## What is this study about?

This study looked at the best timing for placing embryos (early stage babies) into a woman's uterus during in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. Researchers compared two different timings: placing embryos on day two versus day three after the egg is collected.

## Why does timing matter?

In the past, embryos were always placed on day two. Modern laboratory techniques now allow embryos to grow in the lab for longer—up to day three or beyond. Scientists wondered if waiting until day three would give embryos more time to develop and lead to better chances of pregnancy.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at 15 previous studies that compared day two versus day three embryo transfer. These studies included nearly 2,900 women undergoing IVF treatment.

## What were the main findings?

**The bottom line: Timing did not make a difference.**

Researchers found no meaningful differences between day two and day three transfer for:
- Live births (babies born)
- Ongoing pregnancies
- Clinical pregnancies (confirmed pregnancies)
- Multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.)
- Miscarriages
- Ectopic pregnancies (pregnancies outside the uterus)

## What does this mean?

Whether embryos are placed on day two or day three, pregnancy success rates appear to be about the same. The choice between these two timings does not appear to affect a couple's chances of having a baby.

## Important note

The quality of evidence in these studies varied, and some information about side effects was not reported.","### Plain Language Summary

**Why the Study Was Done**

Scientists wanted to see if it made a difference to transfer embryos on Day 3 instead of Day 2 during IVF treatments. IVF is a process that helps couples have babies when they have trouble doing so naturally.

**What the Study Looked At**

The study checked if moving the embryo transfer to Day 3 would affect how many women had live births or ongoing pregnancies. They compared the results of Day 3 transfers with Day 2 transfers for couples going through IVF treatments.

**How the Study Was Done**

Researchers looked at many studies from different sources to find out what happens when embryo transfers are done on Day 3 vs. Day 2. They checked if transferring on different days changed the chance of having a baby or any problems during pregnancy.

**What They Found**

- **Live Birth Rates**: No clear difference was found between Day 2 and Day 3 transfers. If 32 out of 100 women had live births with a Day 2 transfer, then about 28 to 39 might with a Day 3 transfer.
- **Ongoing Pregnancy**: Again, no clear difference. If 33 out of 100 women had an ongoing pregnancy with a Day 2 transfer, then about 28 to 37 might with a Day 3 transfer.
- **Chance of Pregnancy**: No difference here either. If 39 out of 100 women became pregnant with a Day 2 transfer, then about 38 to 46 might with a Day 3 transfer.
- **Multiple Pregnancies and Miscarriages**: The chance of having twins or more, or having a miscarriage, was about the same on both days.
- **Ectopic Pregnancy**: No difference in risk was found between the two days.

**Conclusions**

This study did not find any big differences in the outcomes when embryo transfer was done on Day 3 compared to Day 2. The study’s findings are probably not going to change with more research. So, they suggest not updating this research anymore."
"Background
Worldwide, mother‐to‐child transmission (MTCT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) represents the most common means by which children acquire HIV infection.  Efficacious and effective interventions to prevent in utero and intrapartum transmission of HIV infection have been developed and implemented.  However, a large proportion of MTCT of HIV occurs postnatally, through breast milk transmission.  
Objectives
The objectives of this systematic review were to collate and assess the evidence regarding interventions to decrease late postnatal MTCT of HIV, and to determine the efficacy of such interventions in decreasing late postnatal MTCT of HIV, increasing overall survival, and increasing HIV‐free survival.  
Search methods
Electronic searches were undertaken using PubMed, EMBASE and other databases for 1980‐2008.  Hand searches of reference lists of pertinent reviews and studies, as well as abstracts from relevant conferences, were also conducted.  Experts in the field were contacted to locate any other studies.  The search strategy was iterative.     
Selection criteria
Randomized clinical trials assessing the efficacy of interventions to prevent MTCT of HIV through breast milk were included in the analysis.  Other trials and intervention cohort studies with relevant data also were included, but only when randomization was not feasible due to the nature of the intervention (i.e., infant feeding modality).  
Data collection and analysis
Data regarding HIV infection status and vital status of infants born to HIV‐infected women, according to intervention, were extracted from the reports of the studies. 
Main results
Six randomized clinical trials and one intervention cohort study were included in this review.  Two trials addressed the issue of shortening the duration of (or eliminating) exposure to breast milk. In a trial of breastfeeding versus formula feeding, formula feeding was efficacious in preventing MTCT of HIV (the cumulative probability of HIV infection at 24 months was 36.7% in the breastfeeding arm and 20.5% in the formula arm [p = 0.001]), but the mortality and malnutrition rates during the first two years of life were similar in the two groups.  In a trial of early cessation of breastfeeding, HIV‐free survival was similar between those children who ceased breastfeeding abruptly around four months of age and those who continued breastfeeding.  Another trial addressing vitamin supplementation found more cases of HIV infection among children of mothers in the vitamin A arm.  Efficacy for other vitamin supplements was not shown.  An intervention cohort study evaluated the risk of MTCT by six months of age according to infant feeding modality, and found increased risks of MTCT among breastfed children who also received solids any time after birth (hazard ratio = 10.87, 1.51‐78.00, p = 0.018). Cumulative 3‐month mortality among formula fed infants was higher than among exclusively breastfed infants (hazard ratio = 2.06, 1.00‐4.27, p = 0.051). Three trials evaluated antiretroviral prophylaxis to breastfeeding infants. In one trial conducted in Botswana, mothers received zidovudine prophylaxis beginning at 34 weeks gestation and during labor, and mother and infants were randomized to receive a two‐dose nevirapine regimen or placebo.  Infants were randomized to six months of breastfeeding with zidovudine prophylaxis (breastfeeding+zidovudine) or formula feeding with one month of infant zidovudine (formula+zidovudine). Mothers were instructed to initiate and complete weaning between five and six months of age. Breastfeeding+zidovudine (transmission rate = 9.0%) was not as effective as formula+zidovudine (transmission rate 5.6%) in preventing late postnatal HIV transmission (p = 0.04).  Breastfeeding+zidovudine and formula+zidovudine had comparable HIV‐free survival rates at 18 months (p = 0.60). Two trials of extended infant nevirapine prophylaxis demonstrated efficacy.  In the first (data combined from trials conducted in three different countries), a six‐week course of nevirapine resulted in a lower risk of HIV transmission by six weeks of age (p=0.009), but not at six months of age (p = 0.016).  In the second, mothers were counseled to breastfeed exclusively for six months and to consider weaning thereafter.  Nevirapine administration until 14 weeks of age (5.2%) or nevirapine with zidovudine until 14 weeks of age (6.4%) resulted in significantly lower risks of MTCT of HIV by 9 months of age than a control regimen of two‐dose nevirapine prophylaxis (10.6%) (p < 0.001).  HIV‐free survival was significantly better through the age of 9 months in both extended prophylaxis groups, and through the age of 15 months in the extended nevirapine group.   
Authors' conclusions
Complete avoidance of breastfeeding is efficacious in preventing MTCT of HIV, but this intervention has significant associated morbidity (e.g., diarrheal morbidity if formula is prepared without clean water).  If breastfeeding is initiated, two interventions 1). exclusive breastfeeding during the first few months of life;  and 2)  extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant (nevirapine alone, or nevirapine with zidovudine) are efficacious in preventing transmission.","Transmission of HIV from mother to child through breast milk
Mother‐to‐child transmission (MTCT) of HIV is the primary way that children become infected with HIV.  Such transmission can take place when the child is still in the mother’s womb, around the time of birth, or through breastfeeding after birth.  Hundreds of thousands of children are infected this way every year, with most of them in developing countries.  Major progress has been made in preventing MTCT when the baby is still in the mother’s womb, or around the time the baby is born.  In many resource‐rich settings, mothers with HIV infection are counseled not to breastfeed their children, and there are feasible and affordable alternatives to breastfeeding.  However, in parts of the world where the vast majority of mothers with HIV infection live, complete avoidance of breastfeeding is often not feasible (for example, because of the lack of availability of clean water and of affordable replacement feeding).  Therefore, interventions to prevent transmission of HIV infection through breast milk are urgently needed.  The authors found that, in addition to complete avoidance of breastfeeding if safe and affordable, exclusive breastfeeding (where the baby receives only breast milk) for the first few months of life helps prevent transmission (as compared to breastfeeding supplemented by feeding the baby other liquids or solids).  Another intervention, giving the baby an anti‐HIV medicine (antiretroviral) while breastfeeding, decreases the risk of transmission of HIV from mother to child. Implementation of such interventions, as well as developing more and better interventions, is essential.","# Plain Language Summary: Preventing HIV Transmission Through Breast Milk

## What is this study about?

This review looked at different ways to prevent babies from getting HIV from their mothers through breast milk. Researchers searched for studies done between 1980 and 2008 that tested these prevention methods.

## Why is this important?

Around the world, many babies get HIV from their mothers during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. Scientists have found good ways to prevent transmission during pregnancy and birth, but many babies still get HIV through breast milk after they are born.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at 6 randomized studies (where people are randomly assigned to different treatment groups) and 1 other study. They searched medical databases and asked experts to find all available studies about preventing HIV transmission through breast milk.

## What did they find?

**Formula feeding vs. breastfeeding:**
- Babies fed formula had fewer HIV infections (20.5%) compared to breastfed babies (36.7%)
- However, both groups had similar rates of death and poor nutrition in the first two years

**Stopping breastfeeding early:**
- Babies who stopped breastfeeding around 4 months had similar survival rates as those who continued breastfeeding

**Vitamin supplements:**
- Vitamin A did not help and may have increased HIV infections
- Other vitamins did not show benefits

**Medicine for breastfeeding babies:**
- Babies who took the medicine nevirapine (alone or with another medicine called zidovudine) for up to 14 weeks had fewer HIV infections
- These babies also stayed healthier longer

## Bottom line

Not breastfeeding prevents HIV transmission but can cause other health problems. If mothers do breastfeed, giving babies medicine (nevirapine) for several weeks helps prevent HIV infection.","### Study Summary: Reducing HIV Transmission from Mothers to Babies

**Purpose of the Study**
This study looked at ways to reduce the chance of HIV-positive mothers passing the virus to their babies through breastfeeding. The goal was to find effective methods to prevent this transmission, help babies survive, and keep them HIV-free.

**What Was Studied?**
Researchers examined different approaches, such as formula feeding, breastfeeding methods, and medicine for babies to prevent HIV. They reviewed studies and conducted trials from 1980 to 2008 to gather evidence.

**Who Participated?**
The study analyzed information from several trials that included HIV-positive mothers and their infants.

**Key Findings**
1. **Formula Feeding:** Babies fed with formula had a lower risk of getting HIV compared to those who breastfed; however, both groups had similar death and malnutrition rates in the first two years.

2. **Stopping Breastfeeding Early:** Ending breastfeeding around four months didn't significantly change HIV-free survival rates compared to continued breastfeeding.

3. **Vitamins:** Vitamin A supplements didn't reduce HIV transmission and weren't effective.

4. **Feeding with Solids:** Babies who breastfed and received solid foods early had a higher risk of getting HIV.

5. **Medicine to Prevent HIV:**
   - **Zidovudine and Nevirapine:** Babies given these medicines had lower rates of HIV transmission. When combined with breastfeeding and medicine, HIV-free survival rates were similar to formula feeding.

   - **Extended Nevirapine:** Giving this medicine for 14 weeks lowered the chances of babies getting HIV by 9 months and improved survival rates to 15 months.

**Conclusion**
To prevent HIV transmission from mother to child, avoiding breastfeeding entirely is effective but can lead to health issues if formula isn’t prepared safely. If breastfeeding, sticking to exclusive breastfeeding early and giving babies certain medicines (like nevirapine) can help reduce the risk."
"Background
Mitoxantrone (MX) has been shown to be moderately effective in reducing the clinical outcome measures of disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. 
This is an update of the Cochrane review ""Mitoxantrone for multiple sclerosis"" (published on Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2013, Issue 5). 
Objectives
The main objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of MX compared to a control group in relapsing‐remitting (RRMS), progressive relapsing (PRMS) and secondary progressive (SPMS) MS participants. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Group Specialised Register (23 May 2013). We also undertook handsearching and contacted trialists and pharmaceutical companies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised, double‐blinded, controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the administration of MX versus placebo or MX plus steroids treatment versus placebo plus steroids treatment were included. 
Data collection and analysis
The review authors independently selected articles for inclusion. They independently extracted clinical, safety and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, resolving disagreements by discussion. Risk of bias was evaluated to assess the quality of the studies. Treatment effect was measured using odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the binary outcomes and mean differences (MD) with 95% CI for the continuous outcomes. If heterogeneity was absent, a fixed‐effect model was used. 
Main results
Three trials were selected and 221 participants were included in the analyses. MX reduced the progression of disability at two years follow‐up (proportion of participants with six months confirmed progression of disability (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.99 and MD ‐0.36, 95% CI‐ 0.70 to ‐0.02; P = 0.04). Significant results were found regarding the reduction in annualised relapse rate (MD ‐0.85, 95% CI ‐1.47 to ‐0.23; P = 0.007), the proportion of patients free from relapses at one year (OR 7.13, 95% CI 2.06 to 24.61; P = 0.002) and two years (OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.54 to 5.19; P = 0.0008), and the number of patients with active MRI lesions at six months or one year only (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.57; P = 0.001). 
Side effects reported in the trials (amenorrhoea, nausea and vomiting, alopecia and urinary tract infections) were more frequent in treated patients than in controls, while no major adverse events have been reported. These results should be considered with caution because of the limited number of included subjects the heterogeneous characteristics of included trials in term of drug dosage, inclusion criteria and quality of included trials. Moreover, it was not possible to estimate the long‐term efficacy and safety of MX. 
Authors' conclusions
MX shows a significant but partial efficacy in reducing the risk of MS progression and the frequency of relapses in patients affected by worsening RRMS, PRMS and SPMS in the short‐term follow‐up (two years). No major neoplastic events or symptomatic cardiotoxicity related to MX have been reported; however studies with longer follow‐up (not included in this review) have raised concerns about the risk of systolic disfunction and therapy‐related acute leukaemias, occurring in about 12% and 0.8% of MX‐treated patients respectively. 
MX should be limited to treating patients with worsening RRMS and SPMS and with evidence of persistent inflammatory activity after a careful assessment of the individual patients’ risk and benefit profiles. Assessment should also consider the present availability of alternative therapies with less severe adverse events.","The use of the immunosuppressive drug mitoxantrone (MX) in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) 
This is an update of the Cochrane review ""Mitoxantrone for multiple sclerosis"" (published on Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2013, Issue 5). 
MX is considered an immune‐mediated chronic disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by multiple areas of inflammation and demyelination. Several drugs such as steroids as well as immunomodulant and immunosuppressive agents have been used to treat the disease course. Among them, MX, an immunosuppressive agent widely used for treatment of breast cancer and leukaemia, has been tested in MS individuals. Two hundred seventy‐five articles were identified by the search strategy up to May 2013. Three trials contributed to this review, comprising a total of 221 participants. Data show that MX was moderately effective in reducing the risk of MS progression and the frequency of relapses in short‐term follow‐up (up to two years) of patients affected by worsening relapsing‐remitting MS (RRMS), progressive relapsing MS (PRMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS). However, caution must be exercised when interpreting these results because of the heterogeneous characteristics and quality of the included trials, which are different in terms of treatment schedules and types of enrolled patients. 
The most frequent adverse effects were nausea and vomiting, alopecia, urinary tract infections and transitory leucopenia; 35% of MX‐treated female participants developed transitory amenorrhoea, and almost 15% developed a persistent amenorrhoea which was still present at the end of the follow‐up period. Data from studies with longer follow‐up and out of included trials have raised concerns about cardiotoxicity and acute leukaemias, occurring in about 12% and 0.8% of MX‐treated patients respectively.   
For these reasons, MX treatment should be limited to patients with worsening RRMS and SPMS after a careful assessment of the individual patients’ risk and benefit profiles, also considering the present availability of alternative therapies with less severe adverse events. Moreover, MX‐treated patients need to be followed‐up after the end of treatment to control the risk of serious adverse events.","# Plain Language Summary: Mitoxantrone for Multiple Sclerosis

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether a medicine called mitoxantrone (MX) helps people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Researchers combined information from three previous studies involving 221 people to see if MX worked better than a placebo (fake medicine).

## Who was in the studies?

The studies included people with different types of MS that were getting worse, including:
- Relapsing-remitting MS (where symptoms come and go)
- Progressive relapsing MS (where symptoms gradually worsen with flare-ups)
- Secondary progressive MS (where symptoms gradually worsen over time)

## What did the studies test?

Researchers compared MX to placebo or compared MX plus steroids to placebo plus steroids.

## What were the main findings?

**Good results:**
- MX slowed down disability progression over two years
- Fewer disease flare-ups occurred in people taking MX
- More people taking MX stayed free from flare-ups for one to two years
- Brain scans showed fewer active lesions in people taking MX

**Side effects:**
- More people taking MX experienced side effects like hair loss, nausea, vomiting, and urinary tract infections compared to those taking placebo
- No major serious problems were reported in these three studies

## Important cautions

- Only three small studies were reviewed, so results should be interpreted carefully
- Long-term safety and effectiveness are unknown
- Other studies (not included here) suggest rare but serious risks like heart problems and blood cancer in some patients taking MX
- Doctors should consider other available treatments with fewer side effects","### Plain Language Summary of the Mitoxantrone Study

**Purpose of the Study**
The study aimed to see how well a medicine called Mitoxantrone (MX) works and how safe it is for people with certain types of multiple sclerosis (MS).

**Who Was in the Study**
The study looked at people with types of MS known as relapsing‐remitting (RRMS), progressive relapsing (PRMS), and secondary progressive (SPMS).

**What Was Done**
Researchers compared people taking MX to those who didn't take it, and some also had extra treatments like steroids. The study included three separate trials with a total of 221 participants.

**Key Findings**
- Over two years, MX helped lower the disability progression (how quickly the disease worsens).
- It also reduced the number of relapses (times when symptoms get worse) each year.
- More participants stayed relapse-free for one year and two years.
- Fewer people showed active disease signs when checked with MRI scans (a type of body scan).

**Side Effects**
People taking MX reported some side effects, like missed periods, feeling sick, hair loss, and bladder infections. No major harmful effects were noted in the study, but these side effects happened more often than in those who didn't take MX.

**Limitations**
- The study didn't have many participants.
- The way the trials were done varied, making it hard to get a full picture.
- Long-term safety and effectiveness are still unknown.

**Conclusions**
Mitoxantrone can help reduce MS symptoms over two years but with some side effects. Long-term use raises concerns about heart and blood problems in a small number of cases. It's important to weigh risks and benefits, especially with other treatments available that may have fewer side effects."
"Background
Acupuncture is increasingly used in people with epilepsy. It remains unclear whether existing evidence is rigorous enough to support its use. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2008. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in people with epilepsy.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (June 2013) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 5), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED and other databases (from inception to June 2013). We reviewed reference lists from relevant trials. We did not impose any language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with placebo or sham treatment, antiepileptic drugs or no treatment; or comparing acupuncture plus other treatments with the same other treatments, involving people of any age with any type of epilepsy. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
Main results
We included 17 RCTs with 1538 participants that had a wide age range and were suffering mainly from generalized epilepsy. The duration of treatment varied from 7.5 weeks to 1 year. All included trials had a high risk of bias with short follow‐up. Compared with Chinese herbs, needle acupuncture plus Chinese herbs was not effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (80% in control group versus 90% in intervention group, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.31, 2 trials; assumed risk 500 per 1000, corresponding risk 485 to 655 per 1000). Compared with valproate, needle acupuncture plus valproate was not effective in achieving freedom from seizures (44% in control group versus 42.7% in intervention group, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.30, 2 trials; assumed risk 136 per 1000, corresponding risk 97 to 177 per 1000) or at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (69.3% in control group versus 81.3% in intervention group, RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.52 to 3.48, 2 trials; assumed risk 556 per 1000, corresponding risk 289 to 1000 per 1000) but may have achieved better quality of life (QOL) after treatment (QOLIE‐31 score (higher score indicated better QOL) mean 170.22 points in the control group versus 180.32 points in the intervention group, MD 10.10 points, 95% CI 2.51 to 17.69 points, 1 trial). Compared with phenytoin, needle acupuncture was not effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (70% in control group versus 94.4% in intervention group, RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.44, 2 trials; assumed risk 700 per 1000, corresponding risk 322 to 1000 per 1000). Compared with valproate, needle acupuncture was not effective in achieving seizure freedom (14.1% in control group versus 25.2% in intervention group, RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.93 to 3.27, 2 trials; assumed risk 136 per 1000, corresponding risk 126 to 445 per 1000) but may be effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (55.3% in control group versus 73.7% in intervention group, RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.66, 2 trials; assumed risk 556 per 1000, corresponding risk 583 to 923 per 1000) and better QOL after treatment (QOLIE‐31 score mean 172.6 points in the control group versus 184.64 points in the intervention group, MD 12.04 points, 95% CI 4.05 to 20.03 points, 1 trial). Compared with antiepileptic drugs, catgut implantation at acupoints plus antiepileptic drugs was not effective in achieving seizure freedom (13% in control group versus 19.6% in intervention group, RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.43, 4 trials; assumed risk 127 per 1000, corresponding risk 118 to 309 per 1000) but may be effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (63.1% in control group versus 82% in intervention group, RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.89, 5 trials; assumed risk 444 per 1000, corresponding risk 475 to 840 per 1000) and better QOL after treatment (QOLIE‐31 score (higher score indicated worse quality of life) mean 53.21 points in the control group versus 45.67 points in the intervention group, MD ‐7.54 points, 95% CI ‐14.47 to ‐0.61 points, 1 trial).

Acupuncture did not have excess adverse events compared to control treatment in the included trials. 
Authors' conclusions
Available RCTs are small, heterogeneous and have high risk of bias. The current evidence does not support acupuncture for treating epilepsy.","Acupuncture for epilepsy
People with epilepsy are currently treated with antiepileptic drugs but a significant number of people continue to have seizures and many experience adverse effects to the drugs. As a result, there is increasing interest in alternative therapies and acupuncture is one of those. Seventeen randomised controlled trials with 1538 participants were included in the current systematic review (literature search conducted on 3rd June 2013). 
Compared with Chinese herbs, needle acupuncture plus Chinese herbs was not effective in achieving satisfactory seizure control (at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency). If we assumed that 500 out of 1000 patients treated with Chinese herbs alone normally achieved satisfactory seizure control, we estimated that 485 to 655 out of 1000 patients treated with needle acupuncture plus Chinese herbs would achieve satisfactory seizure control. Compared with valproate, needle acupuncture plus valproate was not effective in achieving freedom from seizures or satisfactory seizure control. If we assumed that 136 out of 1000 patients treated with valproate alone normally achieved seizure freedom, we estimated that about 97 to 177 out of 1000 patients treated with acupuncture plus valproate would achieve seizure freedom; if we assumed that 556 out of 1000 patients treated with valproate alone normally achieved satisfactory seizure control, we estimated that about 289 to 1000 out of 1000 patients treated with acupuncture plus valproate would achieve satisfactory seizure control. Compared with phenytoin, needle acupuncture was not effective in achieving satisfactory seizure control. If we assumed that 700 out of 1000 patients treated with phenytoin alone normally achieved satisfactory seizure control, we estimated that about 322 to 1000 out of 1000 patients treated with acupuncture alone would achieve satisfactory seizure control. Compared with valproate, needle acupuncture was not effective in achieving seizure freedom but it may have been better in achieving satisfactory seizure control. If we assumed that 136 out of 1000 patients treated with valproate alone normally achieved seizure freedom, we estimated that about 126 to 445 out of 1000 patients treated with acupuncture alone would achieve seizure freedom; if we assumed that 556 out of 1000 patients treated with valproate alone normally achieved satisfactory seizure control, we estimated that about 583 to 923 out of 1000 patients treated with acupuncture alone would achieve satisfactory seizure control. Compared with antiepileptic drugs, catgut implantation at acupoints plus antiepileptic drugs was not effective in achieving seizure freedom, but it may have been better in achieving satisfactory seizure control. If we assumed that 127 out of 1000 patients treated with antiepileptic drugs alone normally achieved seizure freedom, we estimated that about 118 to 309 out of 1000 patients treated with catgut implantation at acupoints plus antiepileptic drugs would achieve seizure freedom; If we assumed that 444 out of 1000 patients treated with antiepileptic drugs alone normally achieved satisfactory seizure control, we estimated that about 475 to 840 out of 1000 patients treated with catgut implantation at acupoints plus antiepileptic drugs would achieve satisfactory seizure control. Compared with valproate, catgut implantation may have been better in achieving seizure freedom but not satisfactory seizure control. If we assumed that 82 out of 1000 patients treated with valproate alone normally achieved seizure freedom, we estimated that about 132 to 406 out of 1000 patients treated with catgut implantation at acupoints alone would achieve seizure freedom; if we assumed that 721 out of 1000 patients treated with valproate alone normally achieved satisfactory seizure control, we estimated that about 677 to 1000 out of 1000 patients treated with catgut implantation at acupoints alone would achieve satisfactory seizure control. 
Acupuncture did not have excess adverse events compared to control treatment in the included trials. However, the included trials were small, heterogeneous and had a high risk of bias. It remains uncertain whether acupuncture is effective and safe for treating people with epilepsy.","# Plain Language Summary: Acupuncture for Epilepsy

## What This Study Was About
Researchers wanted to find out if acupuncture (using needles on specific body points) works to treat epilepsy and if it's safe. This is an updated review of studies from 2008.

## What They Did
The researchers looked at 17 different studies involving 1,538 people with epilepsy. They compared acupuncture to:
- Regular epilepsy medicines (like valproate and phenytoin)
- Fake acupuncture (sham treatment)
- Chinese herbs
- Catgut implants placed at acupuncture points

The studies lasted between 7.5 weeks and 1 year.

## Main Findings
**The bottom line:** The studies were small and had problems with how they were done. Based on the evidence available, acupuncture does not appear to work well for treating epilepsy.

**Specific results:**
- Acupuncture did not stop seizures or reduce them by half as well as regular medicines did
- When combined with regular medicine, acupuncture may have helped people feel slightly better overall (better quality of life), but it didn't reduce seizures more than medicine alone
- Acupuncture did not cause more side effects than other treatments

## Important Limitations
- All the studies had quality problems
- The studies were very different from each other, making them hard to compare
- Follow-up time was short
- More and better research is needed

## Bottom Line
Right now, there isn't enough good evidence to recommend acupuncture as a treatment for epilepsy.","### Plain Language Summary

#### Study Purpose
This study looked at whether acupuncture is effective and safe for people who have epilepsy.

#### Who Participated
Researchers reviewed results from 17 different studies, involving 1,538 people of all ages with various types of epilepsy.

#### What Was Tested
The studies compared acupuncture with:
- Fake treatments (like pretend acupuncture)
- Epilepsy medications
- No treatment at all

They also compared acupuncture combined with other treatments to just using those other treatments alone.

#### Main Results
- **Seizures:** Acupuncture did not significantly reduce seizures or stop them completely when compared to medications or other treatments.
- **Quality of Life:** Some people reported a slight improvement in their quality of life after acupuncture.
- **Safety:** Acupuncture did not cause more negative effects compared to other treatments.

#### Study Duration
The treatments lasted anywhere from about 7 weeks to 1 year.

#### Safety
Acupuncture was not linked with more negative effects than the other treatments tested.

#### Final Thoughts
Based on the current evidence, acupuncture doesn't seem to be a reliable treatment for epilepsy. More high-quality research is needed to understand its effectiveness."
"Background
Sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease is a common debilitating condition that predominantly affects young adults, with a profound impact on their activities of daily living. The condition is treated surgically, and in some cases the wound in the natal cleft is left open to heal by itself. Many dressings and topical agents are available to aid healing of these wounds. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of dressings and topical agents for the management of open wounds following surgical treatment for sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus in any care setting. 
Search methods
In March 2021, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and we scanned reference lists of included studies, reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. 
Selection criteria
We included parallel‐group randomised controlled trials (RCTs) only. We included studies with participants who had undergone any type of sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease surgery and were left with an open wound. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. 
Main results
We included 11 RCTs comprising 932 participants. Two studies compared topical negative pressure wound therapy (TNPWT) with conventional open wound healing, two studies compared platelet‐rich plasma with sterile absorbent gauze, and the other seven studies compared various dressings and topical agents. All studies were at high risk of bias in at least one domain, whilst one study was judged to be at low risk of bias in all but one domain. All studies were conducted in secondary care. Mean participant ages were between 20 and 30 years, and nearly 80% of participants were male. No studies provided data on quality of life, cost‐effectiveness, pain at first dressing change or proportion of wounds healed at 6 or 12 months, and very few adverse effects were recorded in any study. 
It is unclear whether TNPWT reduces time to wound healing compared with conventional open wound healing (comparison 1), as the certainty of evidence is very low. The two studies provided conflicting results, with one study showing benefit (mean difference (MD) −24.01 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) −35.65 to −12.37; 19 participants), whilst the other reported no difference. It is also unclear whether TNPWT has any effect on the proportion of wounds healed by 30 days (risk ratio (RR) 3.60, 95% CI 0.49 to 26.54; 19 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). Limited data were available for our secondary outcomes time to return to normal daily activities and recurrence rate; we do not know whether TNPWT has any effect on these outcomes. 
Lietofix cream may increase the proportion of wounds that heal by 30 days compared with an iodine dressing (comparison 4; RR 8.06, 95% CI 1.05 to 61.68; 205 participants, 1 study; low‐certainty evidence). The study did not provide data on time to wound healing. 
We do not know whether hydrogel dressings reduce time to wound healing compared with wound cleaning with 10% povidone iodine (comparison 5; MD −24.54 days, 95% CI −47.72 to −1.36; 31 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). The study did not provide data on the proportion of wounds healed. It is unclear whether hydrogel dressings have any effect on adverse effects as the certainty of the evidence is very low. 
Platelet‐rich plasma may reduce time to wound healing compared with sterile absorbent gauze (comparison 6; MD −19.63 days, 95% CI −34.69 to −4.57; 210 participants, 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence). No studies provided data on the proportion of wounds healed. Platelet‐rich plasma may reduce time to return to normal daily activities (MD −15.49, 95% CI −28.95 to −2.02; 210 participants, 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence). 
Zinc oxide mesh may make little or no difference to time to wound healing compared with placebo (comparison 2; median 54 days in the zinc oxide mesh group versus 62 days in the placebo mesh group; low‐certainty evidence). We do not know whether zinc oxide mesh has an effect on the proportion of wounds healed by 30 days as the certainty of the evidence is very low (RR 2.35, 95% CI 0.49 to 11.23). 
It is unclear whether gentamicin‐impregnated collagen sponge reduces time to wound healing compared with no dressing (comparison 7; MD −1.40 days, 95% CI −5.05 to 2.25; 50 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). The study did not provide data on the proportion of wounds healed. 
Dialkylcarbamoyl chloride (DACC)‐coated dressings may make little or no difference to time to wound healing compared with alginate dressings (comparison 8; median 69 (95% CI 62 to 72) days in the DACC group versus 71 (95% CI 69 to 85) days in the alginate group; 1 study, 246 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
One study compared a polyurethane foam hydrophilic dressing with an alginate dressing (comparison 3) whilst another study compared a hydrocolloid dressing with an iodine dressing (comparison 9). It is unclear whether either intervention has any effect on time to wound healing as the certainty of evidence is very low. 
Authors' conclusions
At present, the evidence that any of the dressings or topical agents contained in this review have a benefit on time to wound healing, the proportion of wounds that heal at a specific time point or on any of the secondary outcomes of our review ranges from low certainty to very low certainty. There is low‐certainty evidence on the benefit on wound healing of platelet‐rich plasma from two studies and of Lietofix cream and hydrogel dressings from single studies. Further studies are required to investigate these interventions further.","How effective are dressings and topical agents in the management of wounds after surgical treatment for pilonidal sinus of the buttocks? 
Key messages 
‐ Platelet‐rich plasma (part of the participant's own blood that promotes tissue regeneration) may reduce time to wound healing compared with sterile gauze‐ Lietofix skin repair cream may help wounds to heal by 30 days compared with a dressing with iodine (which helps to reduce bacteria in the wound)‐ It is not clear whether hydrogel dressings (designed to keep the wound moist) reduce time to wound healing compared with wound cleaning with iodine 
What is pilonidal sinus disease of the buttocks? 
Pilonidal sinus disease of the buttocks is a common painful condition that mainly affects young adults. 
It occurs in the natal cleft (the groove between the buttocks). It begins as infected or inflamed hair follicles. A vacuum effect, created by the motion of the buttocks, may draw more hairs down into the inflamed area. Symptoms can be very painful and sometimes last for a long time. 
How is pilonidal sinus of the buttocks treated? 
The condition is often treated surgically, by cutting out the inflamed area containing the hair and debris, and in some cases the wounds are not closed by stitches but left open to heal naturally. A lot of dressings and topical agents (creams or lotions) are available to help these wounds heal. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to see which dressings and topical agents are better for treating open wounds after surgical treatment for pilonidal sinus of the buttocks.   
For each intervention we looked at:
‐ how long it took wounds to heal;‐ the number of wounds healed after 30 days, 6 months and 1 year;‐ whether the wounds came back;‐ how long it took people who had been treated to return to normal daily activities;‐ quality of life;‐ value for money;‐ pain during the first dressing change;‐ harmful effects (for example surgical site infection or allergic reaction) after treatment. 
What did we do? 
We included participants of any age and either sex who had been treated in any care setting. We searched for studies where: 
‐ participants had been treated for pilonidal sinus disease of the buttocks and were left with an open wound;‐ different dressings and topical agents were compared to see how effective they were for helping wounds to heal.  
What did we find? 
We included 11 studies with a combined total of 932 participants. Two studies compared topical negative pressure wound therapy (which applies controlled suction to the surface of the wound) with simple wound dressings. Two studies compared platelet‐rich plasma with sterile absorbent gauze. The other seven studies compared various dressings and topical agents. All the studies took place in hospitals. 
‐ No studies provided data on quality of life, value for money or pain at the first dressing change.‐ We do not know if topical negative pressure wound therapy helps wounds to heal faster than simple wound dressings.‐ Lietofix skin repair cream may help wounds to heal by 30 days.‐ We do not know if hydrogel dressings help wounds to heal faster or protect better against surgical site infection compared with wound cleaning with 10% povidone iodine.‐ Platelet‐rich plasma may reduce the time to wound healing compared with sterile absorbent gauze. ‐ Compared with placebo mesh, mesh with zinc oxide (which is thought to have healing properties) may have little or no effect on whether wounds heal by 30 days, and it is unclear if it reduces the time to wound healing.‐ We do not know if collagen sponge soaked in antibiotic has any effect on the time to wound healing compared with no dressing.‐ Dressings coated with dialkylcarbamoyl chloride (a substance that bacteria sticks to) may make little to no difference to wound healing time compared with alginate dressings (derived from seaweed).  
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We are not very confident in the evidence because there were only one or two studies in each comparison and most of the studies were very small. It is also possible that people in the studies were aware of what treatment they were getting. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence in this review is up to date to March 2021.","# Plain Language Summary: Dressings and Treatments for Open Wounds After Pilonidal Sinus Surgery

## What is this study about?

Pilonidal sinus disease is a common skin condition that affects young adults, mostly men. It causes pain and makes daily activities difficult. Doctors treat it with surgery, and sometimes they leave the wound open to heal on its own rather than closing it with stitches.

Many different dressings and creams are available to help these open wounds heal. Researchers wanted to find out which ones work best.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at 11 studies involving 932 people who had pilonidal sinus surgery and were left with open wounds. Most participants were men in their 20s and 30s. All studies took place in hospitals.

The researchers compared different treatments, including:
- Special vacuum therapy (a machine that gently pulls on the wound)
- Blood products (platelet-rich plasma)
- Various wound dressings and creams

## What did they find?

**The main finding:** We don't have strong evidence that any one treatment is clearly better than others.

**Some treatments showed promise:**
- **Platelet-rich plasma** (made from the patient's own blood) may help wounds heal about 20 days faster than regular gauze
- **Lietofix cream** may help more wounds heal within 30 days compared to iodine dressing
- **Hydrogel dressings** may help wounds heal faster than cleaning with iodine solution

**Other treatments showed little difference:**
- Zinc oxide mesh, DACC-coated dressings, and foam dressings did not show clear benefits

**Important gaps:** The studies did not measure:
- Quality of life
- Cost
- Pain during dressing changes
- How many wounds healed after 6 or 12 months
- Side effects (very few were reported)

## Bottom line

The evidence is weak for all treatments studied. More research is needed to find the best way to care for these wounds.","### Plain Language Summary

#### Purpose
This study looked into the best ways to help wounds heal after surgery for sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease. It compared different types of dressings and topical treatments.

#### Who Was Studied
The study included 932 people who had surgery for pilonidal sinus disease and were left with open wounds. Most were young adults, aged 20 to 30, and nearly 80% were male.

#### What Was Done
Researchers reviewed 11 different studies that tested various treatments for these wounds:

1. **Topical Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (TNPWT)** vs. regular wound care.
2. **Platelet-rich Plasma** vs. sterile gauze.
3. **Lietofix Cream**, **Hydrogel Dressings**, **Zinc Oxide Mesh**, and several other dressings were compared.

#### What Was Found
- **TNPWT**: It’s unclear if this method helps wounds heal faster compared to regular care.
- **Lietofix Cream**: Might help more wounds heal within 30 days compared to iodine dressings.
- **Hydrogel Dressings**: It's uncertain if they heal wounds faster than cleaning with iodine.
- **Platelet-rich Plasma**: May speed up wound healing and help people return to daily activities faster.
- **Zinc Oxide Mesh**: Likely makes little or no difference compared to placebo.
- **Gentamicin Sponge and Other Dressings**: Evidence on their effectiveness is unclear.

#### What We Still Need to Know
- The studies did not provide information about improvement in quality of life, costs, or pain levels during treatment.
- Most studies had very uncertain results, meaning more research is needed to know what works best for wound healing after this type of surgery.

#### Conclusion
Right now, we're not sure which dressing or treatment is the best for healing these wounds quickly and effectively. More research is needed to find out more about these treatments."
"Background
Faecal incontinence (FI) and constipation are both socially‐embarrassing and physically‐disabling conditions that impair quality of life. For both, surgery may be required in a minority of people when more conservative measures fail. However, the invasiveness and irreversible nature of direct surgery on bowel and sphincter muscles, poor long‐term outcomes and well‐established compIications makes such procedures unappealing for these benign conditions. A less‐invasive surgical option to treat faecal incontinence and constipation is direct, low‐voltage stimulation of the sacral nerve roots, termed sacral nerve stimulation (SNS). SNS has become the first line surgical treatment for FI in people failing conservative therapies. Its value in the treatment of constipation is less clear. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of sacral nerve stimulation using implanted electrodes for the treatment of faecal incontinence and constipation in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In‐Process, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) ICTRP and handsearched journals and conference proceedings (searched 5 February 2015), EMBASE (1 January 1947 to 2015 Week 5), and the reference lists of retrieved relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
All randomised or quasi‐randomised trials assessing the effects of SNS for faecal incontinence or constipation in adults. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed the methodological quality of the included trials, and undertook data extraction. 
Main results
Six crossover trials and two parallel group trials were included.
Six trials assessed the effects of SNS for FI. In the parallel group trial conducted by Tjandra, 53 participants with severe FI in the SNS group experienced fewer episodes of faecal incontinence compared to the control group who received optimal medical therapy (mean difference (MD) −5.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) −9.15 to −1.25 at 3 months; MD −6.30, 95% CI −10.34 to −2.26 at 12 months). Adverse events were reported in a proportion of participants: pain at implant site (6%), seroma (2%) and excessive tingling in the vaginal region (9%). 
In the parallel group trial carried out by Thin, 15 participants with FI in the SNS group experienced fewer episodes of FI compared with the percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) group (MD −3.00, 95% CI −6.61 to 0.61 at 3 months; MD −3.20, 95% CI −7.14 to 0.74 at 12 months). Adverse events were reported in three participants: mild ipsilateral leg pain during temporary testing (n = 1); and stimulator‐site pain following insertion of neurostimulator (n = 2). 
In the crossover trial by Leroi 7 of 34 recruited participants were excluded from the crossover due mainly to complications or immediate device failure. Twenty‐four of the remaining 27 participants while still blinded chose the period of stimulation they had preferred. Outcomes were reported separately for 19 participants who preferred the 'on' and five who preferred the 'off' period. For the group of 19, the median (range) episodes of faecal incontinence per week fell from 1.7 (0 to 9) during the 'off' period to 0.7 (0 to 5) during the 'on' period; for the group of five, however, the median (range) rose from 1.7 (0 to 11) during the 'off' period compared with 3.7 (0 to 11) during the 'on' period. Four of 27 participants experienced an adverse event resulting in removal of the stimulator. 
In the crossover trial by Sørensen and colleagues, participants did not experience any FI episodes in either the one‐week ‘on’ or ‘off’ periods. 
In the crossover trial by Vaizey, participants reported an average of six, and one, episodes of faecal incontinence per week during the 'off' and 'on' periods respectively in two participants with FI. Neither study reported adverse events. 
In the crossover trial by Kahlke, 14 participants with FI experienced significantly lower episodes of FI per week during the stimulator 'on' (1 (SD, 1.7)) compared with the 'off' period (8.4 (SD, 8.7)). Adverse events reported include: haematoma formation (n = 3); misplacement of tined lead (1); and pain at stimulator site (n = 1). 
Two trials assessed SNS for constipation. In the Kenefick trial, the two participants experienced an average of two bowel movements per week during the 'off' crossover period, compared with five during the 'on' period. Abdominal pain and bloating occurred 79% of the time during the 'off' period compared with 33% during the 'on' period. No adverse events occurred. In contrast, in the trial by Dinning with 59 participants, SNS did not improve frequency of bowel movements and 73 adverse events were reported, which included pain at site of the implanted pulse generator (32), wound infection (12), and urological (17) events. 
Authors' conclusions
The limited evidence from the included trials suggests that SNS can improve continence in a proportion of patients with faecal incontinence. However, SNS did not improve symptoms in patients with constipation. In addition, adverse events occurred in some patients where these were reported. Rigorous high quality randomised trials are needed to allow the effects of SNS for these conditions to be assessed with more certainty.","Sacral nerve stimulation for treating faecal incontinence and constipation in adults
Importance of the review/Background: Faecal incontinence occurs when a person passes stools without the usual control. Constipation is harder to define but generally describes a situation in which a person feels that their bowel opening is unsatisfactory (usually a combination of difficulty or infrequency of passing stools). Both conditions can severely affect people's quality of life. There are many non‐surgical treatments for both conditions but occasionally surgery is required when other options fail. Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) is a relatively new treatment for these conditions. It involves implanting a battery‐powered stimulator unit in the buttock. This is connected to electrodes which rest on the nerves in the lower spine. The stimulator then continuously sends impulses to the nerves and muscles that control the bowel and anus. Initially, a temporary electrode lead is connected to a portable battery unit outside the body. If symptoms are improved enough, this is replaced by the implanted battery. 
Main findings: This review evaluated the published evidence for the use of SNS for patients with faecal incontinence or constipation from six trials of SNS for faecal incontinence (219 participants) and two trials of SNS for constipation (61 participants). Two of the faecal incontinence trials had a 'parallel group design', which means that one group of participants received SNS and the other control group did not receive SNS throughout the trial. The remaining six trials had a 'crossover design', in which the participants experienced equal periods with stimulation 'off' then 'on', or vice versa. The level of stimulation was such that participants could not tell whether the system was 'on' or 'off'. 
SNS for faecal incontinence: In the two 'parallel group' trials, 53 and 15 participants with faecal incontinence who were in the SNS group experienced fewer episodes of faecal incontinence compared to the control group at 3 and 12 months. In the first crossover trial, 24 participants who completed the trial chose the period of stimulation they had preferred while still unaware whether this was 'on' or 'off'. Nineteen participants who preferred the 'on' period experienced 59% fewer episodes of FI per week during the 'on' period, and 5 participants who preferred the 'off' period experienced 118% more episodes of FI per week. In the second crossover trial, the participants did not experience episodes of FI during either the 'on' or the 'off' periods. In the third trial, participants experienced 83% fewer episodes of faecal incontinence during the 'on' compared with the 'off' period. In the fourth crossover trial participants experienced 88% fewer episodes of faecal incontinence during the 'on' period compared with the 'off' period. 
SNS for faecal incontinence—adverse effects: Not all trials reported adverse effects after SNS. The two 'parallel group' trials reported only minor complications, in 10% of SNS participants in the first study, and in 3 participants in the second study. In the first crossover study 7 out of 34 participants were excluded from crossover due mainly to complications. Four out of 27 participants with an implanted system in this study experienced a problem that led to the device being removed. The participants in the fourth crossover trial experienced some complications with the SNS implanted electrode such as pain (one person), misplacement of the tined lead (one person) and haematoma (swelling containing blood) (three people). 
SNS for constipation: In one trial assessing SNS for constipation, two participants reported an increase of 150% in the frequency of passing stools per week, and time with abdominal pain and swelling went down from 79% during the 'off' period to 33% during the 'on' period. However, in the much larger second trial assessing SNS for constipation, in 59 participants SNS did not improve frequency of bowel movements. 
Limitations of the review: The limited evidence suggests that SNS can improve continence in some people with faecal incontinence. SNS did not improve symptoms in patients with constipation. Larger, good‐quality trials are needed to provide more reliable evidence on the effectiveness of SNS for these two conditions.","# Plain Language Summary: Sacral Nerve Stimulation for Bowel Problems

## What is this study about?

This review looked at research on a surgical treatment called **sacral nerve stimulation (SNS)** for two bowel problems: fecal incontinence (inability to control bowel movements) and constipation (difficulty having bowel movements). Researchers wanted to see if SNS works and if it's safe.

## How does SNS work?

SNS is a less invasive surgery than traditional bowel surgery. Doctors implant small electrodes near the sacral nerves (nerves in the lower spine) to send mild electrical signals. These signals help control bowel function.

## What did researchers find?

**For fecal incontinence:**
- SNS helped most people have fewer accidents
- In one study, people with SNS had about 5–6 fewer accidents per month compared to those on medication alone
- In another study comparing SNS to a different nerve stimulation treatment, SNS worked slightly better
- Most people preferred having the device turned ""on"" rather than ""off""

**For constipation:**
- SNS did not help people have more regular bowel movements
- One small study showed some improvement, but a larger study found no benefit

## What side effects happened?

Some people experienced problems:
- Pain at the implant site
- Swelling or fluid buildup
- Tingling sensations
- Wound infections
- Rarely, the device had to be removed

## Bottom line

SNS appears to help many people with fecal incontinence, but it does not help with constipation. More high-quality research is needed to be certain about how well it works and how safe it is long-term.","### Plain Language Summary

#### Study Purpose
This study looked at a treatment called sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) to help adults with problems like not being able to control bowel movements (faecal incontinence) and trouble with bowel movements (constipation).

#### How It Works
SNS uses small electric signals to stimulate certain nerves in the lower back. This is a less invasive option than surgery.

#### Who Was Studied
The study included adults with faecal incontinence and constipation. Various trials took part in gathering this data.

#### What They Did
- **Faecal Incontinence:** Six trials tested SNS. For many people, SNS reduced accidents compared to other treatments. Some people had side effects like pain at the implant site and tingling feelings.
- **Constipation:** Two trials tested SNS. Results were mixed. One trial showed improvement, but another did not. Some people reported pain and infections.

#### Results
- **Faecal Incontinence:** SNS helped reduce accidents for some people. It wasn’t perfect, but showed promise.
- **Constipation:** Results were not clear. SNS didn’t consistently help, and some people had side effects.

#### Safety
Some participants experienced side effects like pain and infections. More research is needed to understand these risks better.

#### Conclusion
SNS might help with faecal incontinence, but it’s less clear for constipation. More studies are needed to be sure about its effects and safety."
"Background
The optimal glycaemic control target in pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes is unclear, although there is a clear link between high glucose concentrations and adverse birth outcomes. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different intensities of glycaemic control in pregnant women with pre‐existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2016) and planned to search reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials comparing different glycaemic control targets in pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, conducted data extraction, assessed risk of bias and checked for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included three trials, all in women with type 1 diabetes (223 women and babies). All three trials were at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, unclear methods of randomisation and selective reporting of outcomes. Two trials compared very tight (3.33 to 5.0 mmol/L fasting blood glucose (FBG)) with tight‐moderate (4.45 to 6.38 mmol/L) glycaemic control targets, with one trial of 22 babies reporting no perinatal deaths orserious perinatal morbidity (evidence graded low for both outcomes). In the same trial, there were two congenital anomalies in the very tight, and none in the tight‐moderate group, with no significant differences in caesarean section between groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.73; evidence graded very low). In these two trials, glycaemic control was not significantly different between the very tight and tight‐moderate groups by the third trimester, although one trial of 22 women found significantly less maternal hypoglycaemia in the tight‐moderate group. 
In a trial of 60 women and babies comparing tight (≤ 5.6 mmol/L FBG); moderate (5.6 to 6.7 mmol/L); and loose (6.7 to 8.9 mmol/L) glycaemic control targets, there were two neonatal deaths in the loose and none in the tight or moderate groups (evidence graded very low). There were significantly fewer women with pre‐eclampsia (evidence graded low), fewer caesarean sections (evidence graded low) and fewer babies with birthweights greater than 90th centile (evidence graded low) in the combined tight‐moderate compared with the loose group. 
The quality of the evidence was graded low or very low for important outcomes, because of design limitations to the studies, the small numbers of women included, and wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect. Many of the important outcomes were not reported in these studies. 
Authors' conclusions
In a very limited body of evidence, few differences in outcomes were seen between very tight and tight‐moderate glycaemic control targets in pregnant women with pre‐existing type 1 diabetes, including actual glycaemic control achieved. There is evidence of harm (increased pre‐eclampsia, caesareans and birthweights greater than 90th centile) for 'loose' control (FBG above 7 mmol/L). Future trials comparing interventions, rather than glycaemic control targets, may be more feasible. Trials in pregnant women with pre‐existing type 2 diabetes are required.","What is the best blood glucose target for pregnant women who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes before becoming pregnant? 
What is the issue? 
Pregnant women with diabetes need to keep their blood glucose levels stable, using diet, exercise, insulin or other drugs, clinic visits and monitoring. This review looked at the best blood glucose target for pregnant women with diabetes. 
Why is this important? 
Women who have either type 1 or type 2 diabetes before they become pregnant have an increased risk of pregnancy loss, large babies, and babies dying. When a pregnant woman has high blood glucose and insulin resistance this can affect the development of the baby's heart and other organs. Babies born to diabetic mothers may also have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes. 
Monitoring a diabetic pregnant woman's blood glucose level and staying within a target range may help to reduce these risks. We wanted to find out what the best blood glucose target is for pregnant women who had type 1 or type 2 diabetes before becoming pregnant. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found three small trials (in total 223 pregnant women with type 1 diabetes) looking at different blood glucose targets: very tight, tight, moderate, and loose. The quality of the studies and therefore the strength of the evidence was very low or low, so future research may change the results. 
There were very few differences between very tight and tight‐moderate blood glucose targets in two trials, although there were more cases of low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia) and longer hospital stays for women who had very tight blood glucose control. 
A single trial compared tight, moderate, and loose blood glucose targets. In the loose target group, more women had pre‐eclampsia, and there were more caesareans and large babies. There were few differences between the tight and moderate groups, although more women in the tight control group had low blood glucose in the first half of pregnancy. 
What does this mean? 
The evidence does not show much difference between moderate, tight and very tight blood glucose targets, although a loose blood glucose target may be worse for mothers and babies. However, the studies were small and the evidence is weak, so we do not yet know the best blood glucose target for women who have diabetes before becoming pregnant.","# Plain Language Summary: Blood Sugar Control During Pregnancy in Women with Diabetes

## What is this study about?

This review looked at research comparing different blood sugar control targets for pregnant women who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes before pregnancy. Doctors want to know the best way to manage blood sugar during pregnancy to keep both mom and baby healthy.

## Why does this matter?

High blood sugar levels during pregnancy can cause problems for the baby. However, doctors aren't sure exactly how tight blood sugar control needs to be.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for studies that compared different blood sugar control targets in pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes. They found and reviewed 3 studies that included 223 pregnant women and their babies. All three studies involved women with type 1 diabetes.

## What did they find?

**Comparing very tight vs. tight-moderate control:**
- Two studies compared very tight blood sugar targets with slightly looser targets
- Results were similar between the two approaches
- Women in the looser group had fewer episodes of very low blood sugar
- There were no major differences in birth outcomes

**Comparing tight vs. moderate vs. loose control:**
- One study of 60 women compared three different blood sugar targets
- Loose control (highest blood sugar levels) had worse results:
  - More babies died
  - More mothers developed high blood pressure problems
  - More cesarean sections
  - More babies were larger than expected

## Bottom line

The studies were small and had some quality problems, making it hard to draw strong conclusions. Very tight blood sugar control didn't seem much better than moderate control. However, loose blood sugar control appeared to cause more problems. More research is needed, especially in women with type 2 diabetes.","### Plain Language Summary

**Purpose of the Study**
The study aimed to find out the best way to manage blood sugar in pregnant women who already have type 1 or type 2 diabetes. High blood sugar can lead to problems for both the mother and the baby.

**What Was Done**
Researchers looked at three studies involving pregnant women with type 1 diabetes. They compared different levels of blood sugar control to see which was safest and most effective.

**How the Study Was Conducted**
- The studies were checked for quality, but some had issues like not being blinded (everyone knew which treatment was given) and unclear processes.
- Data was collected and carefully reviewed by researchers.

**Key Findings**
- **Very Tight vs. Tight-Moderate Control:** In two small studies, no major differences in outcomes like baby health and delivery were found between very tight and tight-moderate blood sugar control.
- **Tight vs. Loose Control:** One study found that looser control (higher blood sugar) led to more problems like pre-eclampsia, more C-sections, and heavier babies. Tighter control seemed healthier for both mothers and babies.

**Safety and Quality**
- The evidence was rated as low or very low quality because of the small number of participants and the way the studies were designed.
- Important outcomes were not always reported.

**Conclusion**
- For pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, very tight and tight-moderate blood sugar control showed few differences in outcome.
- Looser blood sugar control can lead to more complications.
- More research is needed, especially for women with type 2 diabetes, focusing on how different treatments can help manage blood sugar effectively."

We searched relevant ongoing trials and research registers (searched March 2020), checked references in all relevant papers for additional eligible studies, and contacted authors and researchers in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of either surgical or endovascular intervention for the management of symptomatic CeAD were eligible for inclusion. Only studies with anticoagulants or antiplatelet treatment as the control group were included. Two review authors planned to independently extract data. 
Data collection and analysis
Primary outcomes were ipsilateral stroke and disability. Secondary outcomes were death, any stroke, or transient ischaemic attack, residual stenosis (> 50%), recurrence of cervical dissection, expanding pseudoaneurysm, or major bleeding. We analysed the studies according to the first choice of treatment. We planned to assess for risk of bias and apply GRADE criteria for any included studies. 
Main results
We did not find any completed RCTs or CCTs undertaken in this area of research.
Authors' conclusions
No RCTs or CCTs compared either surgery or endovascular therapy with control. Thus, there is no available evidence to support their use for the treatment of extracranial cervical artery dissection in addition to antithrombotic therapy in people who continue to have neurological symptoms when treated with antithrombotic therapy alone.","Surgical and radiological interventions for treating symptomatic extracranial cervical artery dissection 
Review question 
This review was conducted to establish whether a surgical operation or a keyhole endovascular treatment, such placement of stent in addition to blood‐thinning medication would improve outcomes in people with cervical artery dissection for whom treatment with blood‐thinning medication alone does not improve persistent or worsening symptoms of stroke. The outcomes which we wished to assess are permanent brain damage and long‐term disability from stroke. 
Background 
Cervical artery dissection is a tear in the wall of the blood vessels in the neck that supply blood to the brain. There are two of each artery, a carotid artery on the right and one on the left of the neck, and a vertebral artery on the right and one on the left of the neck. When tears occur in the walls of these arteries, clots can form inside the artery. These clots can then break away from the artery wall and travel to the brain to cause a stroke. The standard way of treating tears in these arteries is to give patients medications which thin the blood and reduce clot formation. However, sometimes patients continue to get symptoms of stroke, and their condition worsens despite being on maximum dose medication. 
Search date 
We performed a thorough and comprehensive review of the literature to look for clinical trials which could help us to answer the review question. The evidence is current to March 2020. 
Study characteristics 
We looked for trials which were conducted in an objective way and designed specifically to compare either surgery or radiological intervention to medical therapy alone. 
Key results 
We did not find any trials that matched the criteria of the review. Therefore, there is no available objective evidence that an operation or a radiological procedure can benefit patients who continue to have symptoms of stroke despite medical therapy. We did find a number of reports from experienced groups of doctors that operations and radiological interventions were safe in their hands. However, we found no evidence that this could be applicable to other hospitals and clinical teams. Therefore, large scale, well‐conducted studies are required to answer the review question. 
Certainty of the evidence 
There is no good quality evidence to guide clinicians on the best treatment for people with cervical artery dissection who remain symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy.","# Plain Language Summary: Cervical Artery Dissection Treatment Study

## What is this study about?

This review looked for research studies comparing different ways to treat cervical artery dissection (CeAD). This is a tear or bleed in blood vessels in the neck that can cause stroke, especially in younger people.

## What were researchers trying to find out?

Researchers wanted to know if surgery or special imaging procedures (like inserting tubes into blood vessels) work better than medicine alone for treating this condition.

## How did they search for information?

The research team looked through medical databases and records from March 2020 and earlier to find all studies that compared these treatments.

## What did they find?

**The researchers did not find any completed studies that compared surgery or imaging procedures to medicine treatment.**

## What does this mean?

Right now, there is no solid research evidence showing that surgery or imaging procedures help people with cervical artery dissection better than medicine alone (like blood thinners). This doesn't mean these treatments don't work—it just means doctors haven't done the right kind of studies yet to prove whether they help.

## Bottom line

More research is needed to understand the best way to treat cervical artery dissection in people who don't get better with medicine alone.","### Plain Language Summary

#### What is the study about?
This study looks at ways to treat a problem called cervical artery dissection, which happens when there's a tear or bleed in the neck's arteries. This can lead to strokes, especially in young people. The study wants to find out if surgeries or certain medical procedures work better than just using regular medicine to treat this problem.

#### How did they research this?
Researchers searched many databases and checked many studies to find good information. They looked for specific types of studies, called randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials. These studies compared surgery or special procedures to regular medicine treatments.

#### What did they plan to do?
If they found suitable studies, the researchers planned to look at things like how well the treatments worked on strokes, disabilities, and other health issues. They would also check for any biases in the studies.

#### What did they find?
The researchers didn’t find any completed studies that specifically tested surgeries or special procedures against medicine alone for this condition.

#### What does this mean?
Right now, there's no evidence to show that surgeries or special procedures are better than using regular medicines for treating this artery problem in the neck. More research is needed to find effective treatments."
"Background
This is an update of the Cochrane review ""Pharmacologic treatment for memory disorder in multiple sclerosis"" (first published in The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 10). 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune‐mediated, inflammatory, demyelinating, neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) and can cause both neurological and neuropsychological disability. Both demyelination and axonal and neuronal loss are believed to contribute to MS‐related cognitive impairment. Memory disorder is one of the most frequent cognitive dysfunctions and presents a considerable burden to people with MS and to society due to the negative impact on function. A number of pharmacological agents have been evaluated in many existing randomised controlled trials for their efficacy on memory disorder in people with MS but the results were not consistent. 
Objectives
To assess the absolute and comparative efficacy, tolerability and safety of pharmacological treatments for memory disorder in adults with MS. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Group Trials Register (24 July 2013), PsycINFO (January 1980 to 26 June 2013) and CBMdisc (1978 to 24 June 2013), and checked reference lists of identified articles, searched some relevant journals manually, registers of clinical trials and published abstracts of conference proceedings. 
Selection criteria
All double‐blind, randomised controlled parallel trials on pharmacological treatment versus placebo or one or more pharmacological treatments in adults with MS who had at least mild memory impairment (at 0.5 standard deviations below age‐ and sex‐based normative data on a validated memory scale). We placed no restrictions regarding dose, route of administration and frequency; however, we only included trials with an administration duration of 12 weeks or greater. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We discussed disagreements and resolved them by consensus among review authors. We contacted principal investigators of included studies for additional data or confirmation. 
Main results
We included seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 625 people mostly with relapsing‐remitting, secondary‐progressive and primary‐progressive MS, evaluating the absolute efficacy of donepezil, ginkgo biloba, memantine and rivastigmine versus placebo in improving memory performance with diverse assessment scales. Overall, clinical and methodological heterogeneities existed across these studies. Moreover, most of them had methodological limitations on non‐specific selections of targeted sample, non‐matched variables at baseline or incomplete outcome data (high attrition bias). Only the two studies on donepezil had clinical and methodological homogeneity and relatively low risks for bias. One RCT evaluating estriol versus placebo is currently ongoing. 
We could not carry out a meta‐analysis due to the heterogeneities across studies and the high attrition bias. A subgroup analysis for donepezil versus placebo showed no treatment effects on total recall on the Selective Reminding Test (mean difference (MD) 1.68; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐2.21 to 5.58), total correct scores on the 10/36 Spatial Recall Test (MD ‐0.93; 95% CI ‐3.18 to 1.32), the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (MD ‐1.27; 95% CI ‐3.15 to 0.61) and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (2+3 sec) (MD 2.23; 95% CI ‐1.87 to 6.33). Concerning safety, the main adverse events were: diarrhoea (risk ratio (RR) 3.88; 95% CI 1.66 to 9.05), nausea (RR 1.71; 95% CI 0.93 to 3.18) and abnormal dreams (RR 2.91; 95% CI 1.38 to 6.14). However, the results in both studies were subjected to a serious imprecision resulting from the small sample sizes and the low power of test (lower than 80%), which contributed to a moderate quality of the evidence. No serious adverse events were attributed to the treatments in all experimental groups. 
Authors' conclusions
We found no convincing evidence to support the efficacy of pharmacological symptomatic treatment for MS‐associated memory disorder because most of available RCTs had a limited quality. Whether pharmacological treatment is effective for memory disorder in patients with MS remains inconclusive. However, there is moderate‐quality evidence that donepezil 10 mg daily was not effective in improving memory in MS patients with mild memory impairment, but had a good tolerability. Adverse events such as nausea, diarrhoea and abnormal dreams were not frequent but were associated with treatment. Ginkgo biloba, memantine and rivastigmine were safe and well tolerated and no serious adverse effects were reported. Future large‐scale RCTs with higher methodological quality are needed.","Pharmacological agents as symptomatic treatment for memory disorder in people with multiple sclerosis 
This is an update of the Cochrane review ""Pharmacologic treatment for memory disorder in multiple sclerosis"" (first published in The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 10). 
Background 
Memory disorder is one of the most frequent cognitive impairments (where people have difficulty with thinking, learning and memory) in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), affecting an estimated 40% to 60% of people and represents a considerable burden to those people. Data on the use of agents such as donepezil, ginkgo biloba, memantine and rivastigmine, either by mouth (orally) and by other means (parenterally), seemed to provide promising results. The authors of this review tried to assess the extent by which these treatments produced beneficial results (efficacy), whether they had side effects (tolerability) and whether they were safe in adults with all the types of MS. 
Study characteristics 
We searched medical databases for randomised controlled trials (where participants were randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) of adults with MS. Neither patients nor researchers were told which treatment was given. Doctors had diagnosed MS and memory impairment using standard methods. 
Key results and quality of evidence 
Up to July 2013, we found only seven studies with 625 participants that met our requirements although the quality of the included studies was overall low. We did not find convincing evidence to support the use of these drugs as effective symptomatic treatments for memory disorder in people with MS. There was moderate‐quality evidence that donepezil 10 mg daily was ineffective in improving memory in MS patients with mild memory problems, but it was well tolerated. Side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea and abnormal dreams, although not frequent, were reported for donepezil, while ginkgo biloba, memantine and rivastigmine were well tolerated and no serious side effects were reported. 
There is one ongoing study that may ultimately provide valuable evidence in the future updates.","# Plain Language Summary: Medicines for Memory Problems in Multiple Sclerosis

## What is this study about?

This review looks at medicines that might help people with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have memory problems. MS is a long-term disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Many people with MS struggle with remembering things, which can make daily life harder.

## What did researchers want to find out?

Researchers wanted to know:
- Do medicines help improve memory in people with MS?
- Are these medicines safe?
- What side effects do they cause?

## What did they study?

Researchers looked at 7 different studies involving 625 people with MS. These studies tested four different medicines:
- Donepezil
- Ginkgo biloba
- Memantine
- Rivastigmine

Each study compared a medicine to a placebo (a fake pill with no medicine). Studies lasted at least 12 weeks.

## What did they find?

**Memory improvement:** The medicines did not clearly help people remember better. Donepezil (a common medicine) did not improve memory test scores.

**Safety:** The medicines were generally safe. The most common side effects were:
- Diarrhea
- Nausea
- Unusual dreams

No serious side effects happened.

## Bottom line

There is not enough strong evidence that these medicines help MS-related memory problems. Researchers say we need bigger, better-quality studies to know for sure.","**Summary of Clinical Trial on Memory Treatments for MS**

**Purpose of the Study:**
The study looked at different medicines to see if they help with memory problems in adults who have multiple sclerosis (MS).

**Who Was Involved:**
- 625 adults with MS
- These people had some memory difficulties.

**What They Did:**
Researchers tested medicines like donepezil, ginkgo biloba, memantine, and rivastigmine. They wanted to see if these medicines helped memory compared to a fake treatment (placebo).

**How Long It Took:**
The treatments lasted at least 12 weeks.

**What They Found:**
- There wasn’t clear proof that these medicines improved memory in people with MS.
- Donepezil was tested more thoroughly, but the results showed it didn’t help much with memory.
- Some side effects of these treatments included upset stomach, nausea, and strange dreams, but they weren’t common.
- No serious health problems were linked to any of the medicines tested.

**Safety and Side Effects:**
- Medicines like ginkgo biloba, memantine, and rivastigmine were safe to use.
- The side effects were generally mild.

**Conclusion:**
The study didn’t find strong evidence that the medicines improved memory in people with MS. More research with bigger studies is needed to find out if any treatments can help."
"Background
The method of delivering a diagnosis of breast cancer to women has the potential to impact on their level of interpretation, patient recall and satisfaction. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of different methods when used to communicate a primary diagnosis of breast cancer to women. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register on 7th September 2006, Cochrane Consumers and Communication Group on 27th October 2006, MEDLINE (1966 to present), CINAHL (1982 to present), EMBASE OVID (1980 to present), British Nursing Index (Jan 1984 to present), PsycInfo (1967 to present), Dissertation Abstracts International (2004 to 2006), Library and Info Science Abstracts (LISA) (1969 to present), ISI Web of Knowledge (conference abstracts) and reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of women with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer receiving a diagnosis of primary breast cancer. Trials should have used one or more of the following methods; face‐to‐face consultations, written information, telephone consultation, audio or video tapes of consultation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion in the review. Studies were to have been assessed using standardised data extraction and quality assessment forms. 
Main results
The search strategies identified 2847 citations overall. A total of 30 citations appeared relevant however there were three duplicates which left 27 articles for further review. Articles reporting the same primary data accounted for 6 of the publications Brown 1997; Brown 1998; Brown 1999; Brown 2000; Hack 2000; Hack 2003 which left 23 original papers to be reviewed for inclusion. Of these, none met the inclusion criteria. Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality was therefore not possible. 
Authors' conclusions
The review question remains unanswered as there were no randomised trials of methods of communicating a diagnosis of breast cancer to women. The authors have considered the possible reasons for the lack of research studies in this area and have considered that it is perhaps unethical to randomise women at such a vulnerable time such as waiting for a diagnosis. The design of ethically sensitive research to examine this topic needs to be explored to inform future practice. As some papers reviewed by the authors related to the first consultation visit, where treatment options are discussed, perhaps a review which focused on the methods of communication at the first consultation visit would provide more reliable evidence for the effectiveness of methods of communication and overcome the ethical dilemmas previously mentioned.","Ways of communicating to a woman that she has breast cancer
For women to wait for and receive a first diagnosis of breast cancer (primary diagnosis) is an extremely stressful experience. Studies conducted to date suggest that what a woman is told at this time has the potential to influence her sense of well being, the way she copes with the news, how much she remembers of what was discussed (her recall) and her overall level of satisfaction with the encounter.  The diagnosis of confirmed breast cancer can be delivered in a variety of ways, including face‐to‐face consultation, telephone consultation, written or audiovisual materials. This information can be given by a range of health professionals, such as general practitioners or specialists. 
The present systematic review set out to assess the effectiveness of various methods of communicating a first diagnosis of confirmed breast cancer. The review was particularly interested in how this would impact on what the patient remembered, the satisfaction with the information received, the coping strategies used as a result of the information given and the impact of receiving the information on the patient's quality of life. The review authors made a thorough search of the medical literature looking for controlled trials in which women receiving a first diagnosis of breast cancer were randomised to the intervention group. They retrieved 23 original reports of trials for further review but ultimately no trial could be included. A number of the trials focused on communication at the first treatment consultation rather than the method of delivering the diagnosis. In an area that is ethically sensitive, the authors suggest that a review which focuses on the various methods of communication at the first consultation visit may provide useful information as to which methods are more effective and beneficial for this patient group.","# Plain Language Summary: How Doctors Tell Women About Breast Cancer

## What is this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out which ways of telling women they have breast cancer work best. They looked for studies that compared different methods of sharing this diagnosis.

## Why does this matter?

How doctors deliver bad news can affect how well women understand the information, remember what they're told, and how satisfied they feel with their care.

## What methods did researchers look at?

The study considered different ways doctors might tell women about a breast cancer diagnosis:
- Talking face-to-face
- Giving written information
- Talking on the phone
- Showing videos or audio recordings of the conversation

## What did they find?

Researchers searched through thousands of medical articles and databases. They found 2,847 articles at first, but after removing duplicates and checking them carefully, **none of the studies met the requirements** for this review.

## Why weren't there any studies to review?

The researchers think it may be too difficult—or even unethical—to test different ways of delivering a cancer diagnosis. Women waiting for test results are going through an extremely stressful time, and it might not be fair to randomly assign them to different communication methods.

## What happens next?

The researchers suggest that future studies should focus on how doctors communicate during the first treatment planning visit instead. This might be easier to study ethically and could help doctors learn the best ways to talk with patients.","**Plain Language Summary:**

**Purpose of the Study:**  
This study wanted to find out the best way for doctors to tell women about their breast cancer diagnosis. The goal was to see which method helped women understand, remember, and feel satisfied with the information they received.

**How the Study Was Done:**  
Researchers looked at many different sources, like medical journals and databases, to find studies about this topic. They searched several times in 2006.

**What They Were Looking For:**  
They wanted studies where women were told about their breast cancer in different ways, such as face-to-face talks, written information, phone calls, or by listening to recordings.

**Results:**  
They found 2,847 articles, but only 23 were different and seemed related. After checking, none of the studies met the needs for their review because they didn’t use random assignments to test different methods.

**Conclusions:**  
The question remains because no studies met the criteria. The researchers suggest that it might be hard to conduct such studies ethically since it involves women at a sensitive time. They think future research should find ethical ways to explore how to best communicate in these situations. They also suggest looking at how doctors communicate during the first visit about treatment might be more useful."
"Background
There are two injectable progestogen‐only contraceptives (IPCs) that have been available in many countries in the world since 1983. They are both still extensively used in many developing countries, forming a large proportion of the health system's expenditure on contraception. These are depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and norethisterone oenanthate (NET‐EN). These are both highly effective contraceptives that receive wide acceptance amongst women in their fertile years. They differ in frequency of administration that has implications on patient uptake. They also differ in cost that may significantly affect budgeting in the health system. A systematic comparison will aid to ensure their rational use. 
Objectives
To determine if there are differences between depot medroxyprogesterone acetate given at a dose of 150 mg IM every 3 months and norethisterone oenanthate given at a dose of 200mg IM every 2 months, in terms of contraceptive effectiveness, reversibility and discontinuation patterns, minor effects and major effects. 
Search methods
We searched the computerized databases MEDLINE using PubMed, Popline, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Biblioline, LILACS, EMBASE and PASCAL for randomised controlled trials of DMPA versus NET‐EN for long‐acting progestogenic contraception. Studies were included regardless of language, and all databases were reviewed from the time that injectable progestogens have been in use. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled comparisons of DMPA acetate given at a dose of 150 mg IM every 3 months versus NET‐EN given at a dose of 200mg IM every 2 months, used for contraception, were included. Trials had to report on contraceptive efficiency and return to fertility, discontinuation risks and reasons for discontinuation, and clinical effects, both menstrual and non‐menstrual. 
Data collection and analysis
BD and CM evaluated the titles and abstracts obtained through applying the search strategy and applied the eligibility criteria. BD attempted to contact authors where clarification of the data was required, and contacted all main manufacturers of the contraceptives. After inclusion of the two studies, the data was abstracted and analysed with RevMan 4.2. 
Main results
Two trials were included in this review. There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups for the frequency of discontinuation for either contraceptive, although the women on NET‐EN were 4% more likely to discontinue for personal reasons than those on DPMA. Discontinuation because of accidental pregnancy did not differ between the groups. Although the duration of bleeding and spotting events was the same in each group, women on DPMA were 21% more likely to develop amenorrhoea. Mean changes in body weight at 12 and 24 months, and in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 12 months did not differ significantly between the studies. 
Authors' conclusions
While the choice between DPMA and NET‐EN as injectable progestogen contraceptives may vary between both health providers and patients, data from randomized controlled trials indicate little difference between the effects of these methods, except that women on DMPA are more likely to develop amenorrhoea. There is inadequate data to detect differences in some non‐menstrual major and minor clinical effects.","This review compares two injectable hormonal contraceptives containing only progestogen, namely depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and norethisterone oenanthate (NET‐EN), for the risks and reasons of their discontinuation and for their clinical effects 
Injectable hormonal contraceptives remain in extensive use in many developing countries. There are two progestogen‐only injectable contraceptives that have been available in many countries since the 1980's. These are depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and norethisterone oenanthate (NET‐EN). They are both highly effective contraceptives that receive wide acceptance amongst women in their fertile years, and form a sizeable proportion of the health expenditure on contraception. They differ in frequency of administration and cost, and a systematic comparison aids to ensure their rational use. This review seeks to compare DPMA given at a dose of 150 mg IM every 3 months and NET‐EN given at a dose of 200mg IM every 2 months, and determine whether there are differences in contraceptive effectiveness, reversibility and patterns of discontinuation, and their minor and major clinical effects.  All databases were reviewed from the time that injectable progestogens have been in use and this review included all randomised controlled comparisons of DMPA and NET‐EN used for contraception. Trials had to report on contraceptive efficiency and return to fertility, the rates and reasons for stopping use, as well as menstrual and non‐menstrual clinical effects.  It was found that there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups regarding the time from when women started the contraceptive until they stopped its use. The women on NET‐EN were 4% more likely to stop use for personal reasons than those on DPMA, but this difference was not statistically significant. There was no difference between the groups when an accidental pregnancy was the reason to stop use. The length of time of episodes of vaginal bleeding and spotting was the same in each group. Women who were on DPMA were 21% more likely to stop vaginal bleeding altogether while using the contraceptive. Changes in body weight and changes in blood pressure did not differ between DMPA and NET‐EN. Furthermore, these changes in body weight and blood pressure were relatively small and not clinically relevant.  In summary, therefore, data from the trials included in this review indicate little difference between the effects of these methods, except that women on DMPA are more likely to experience cessation of vaginal bleeding during its use. There was inadequate data to detect differences in some non‐menstrual clinical effects, and considering that this contraceptive method remains in use in some countries, further research is indicated.","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Two Injectable Birth Control Methods

## What is this study about?

This study compares two types of injectable birth control (shots) that have been used around the world since 1983. Both are very effective at preventing pregnancy. Researchers wanted to find out if one works better than the other, or if they have different side effects.

## The two birth control methods

**DMPA** – A shot given every 3 months

**NET-EN** – A shot given every 2 months

Both shots contain hormones that prevent pregnancy.

## What researchers wanted to learn

- Which shot works better at preventing pregnancy?
- How quickly does fertility return after stopping?
- Why do women stop using each method?
- What side effects does each one cause?
- Do they affect weight or blood pressure differently?

## How they did the study

Researchers searched medical databases for studies that directly compared these two shots. They found 2 high-quality studies with real patient information to analyze.

## What they found

- **Pregnancy prevention:** Both shots worked equally well.
- **Stopping the method:** Women stopped using each shot at similar rates. Women using NET-EN were slightly more likely to stop for personal reasons.
- **Bleeding changes:** Women using DMPA were more likely to stop having periods completely (21% more likely).
- **Weight and blood pressure:** No significant differences between the two shots.

## Bottom line

The two injectable birth control methods are very similar in how well they work and their side effects. The main difference is that DMPA is more likely to stop a woman's periods. The choice between them may depend on personal preference and how often a woman wants to get a shot.","### Plain Language Summary

#### What’s the Study About?

This study looks at two types of birth control shots used for many years: DMPA and NET-EN. These shots are popular in many countries, especially where they need affordable and effective contraception. Researchers wanted to see if there’s a difference in how well they work and any side effects.

#### Who Was Studied?

The study included women who used either the DMPA shot every 3 months or the NET-EN shot every 2 months.

#### What Did They Do?

Researchers collected information from two similar studies. They compared how effective the shots were at preventing pregnancy, how quickly fertility returned after stopping them, and what side effects women experienced.

#### Main Findings

- **Effectiveness:** Both shots were equally good at preventing pregnancy.
- **Stopping the Shots:** Women stopped using NET-EN for personal reasons 4% more often than DMPA. Accidental pregnancies were rare and similar for both.
- **Side Effects:** Women using DMPA were more likely to stop having periods. Other side effects like weight change and blood pressure didn’t differ much.
- **Data Gaps:** Not enough information was available on other side effects.

#### Conclusions

Both DMPA and NET-EN work well as birth control shots. Women and healthcare providers might choose one over the other based on how often shots are needed and potential side effects, like stopping periods with DMPA. More research is needed on other side effects."
"Background
Globally, cannabis use is prevalent and widespread. There are currently no pharmacotherapies approved for treatment of cannabis use disorders. 
This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in the Cochrane Library in Issue 12, 2014. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapies as compared with each other, placebo or no pharmacotherapy (supportive care) for reducing symptoms of cannabis withdrawal and promoting cessation or reduction of cannabis use. 
Search methods
We updated our searches of the following databases to March 2018: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and Web of Science. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs involving the use of medications to treat cannabis withdrawal or to promote cessation or reduction of cannabis use, or both, in comparison with other medications, placebo or no medication (supportive care) in people diagnosed as cannabis dependent or who were likely to be dependent. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 21 RCTs involving 1755 participants: 18 studies recruited adults (mean age 22 to 41 years); three studies targeted young people (mean age 20 years). Most (75%) participants were male. The studies were at low risk of performance, detection and selective outcome reporting bias. One study was at risk of selection bias, and three studies were at risk of attrition bias. 
All studies involved comparison of active medication and placebo. The medications were diverse, as were the outcomes reported, which limited the extent of analysis. 
Abstinence at end of treatment was no more likely with Δ9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) preparations than with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.52; 305 participants; 3 studies; moderate‐quality evidence). For selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers, buspirone and N‐acetylcysteine, there was no difference in the likelihood of abstinence at end of treatment compared to placebo (low‐ to very low‐quality evidence). 
There was qualitative evidence of reduced intensity of withdrawal symptoms with THC preparations compared to placebo. For other pharmacotherapies, this outcome was either not examined, or no significant differences was reported. 
Adverse effects were no more likely with THC preparations (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.17; 318 participants; 3 studies) or N‐acetylcysteine (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.23; 418 participants; 2 studies) compared to placebo (moderate‐quality evidence). For SSRI antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, buspirone and N‐acetylcysteine, there was no difference in adverse effects compared to placebo (low‐ to very low‐quality evidence). 
There was no difference in the likelihood of withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects with THC preparations, SSRIs antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers, buspirone and N‐acetylcysteine compared to placebo (low‐ to very low‐quality evidence). 
There was no difference in the likelihood of treatment completion with THC preparations, SSRI antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants and buspirone compared to placebo (low‐ to very low‐quality evidence) or with N‐acetylcysteine compared to placebo (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21; 418 participants; 2 studies; moderate‐quality evidence). Anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers appeared to reduce the likelihood of treatment completion (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.92; 141 participants; 3 studies; low‐quality evidence). 
Available evidence on gabapentin (anticonvulsant), oxytocin (neuropeptide) and atomoxetine was insufficient for estimates of effectiveness. 
Authors' conclusions
There is incomplete evidence for all of the pharmacotherapies investigated, and for many outcomes the quality of the evidence was low or very low. Findings indicate that SSRI antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, bupropion, buspirone and atomoxetine are probably of little value in the treatment of cannabis dependence. Given the limited evidence of efficacy, THC preparations should be considered still experimental, with some positive effects on withdrawal symptoms and craving. The evidence base for the anticonvulsant gabapentin, oxytocin, and N‐acetylcysteine is weak, but these medications are also worth further investigation.","Medicines for the treatment of cannabis dependence
Background 
Cannabis use is relatively common and widespread worldwide. Demand by cannabis users for treatment has been increasing in most regions of the world. Moves in some countries to decriminalise or legalise cannabis use is likely to result in this trend continuing. Currently there are no medicines specifically for the treatment of cannabis use. This review sought to assess the effectiveness and safety of medicines for the treatment of cannabis dependence. 
Search date 
We searched the scientific literature in March 2018.
Study characteristics 
We identified 21 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are allocated at random to one of two or more treatment groups) involving 909 participants treated with active medicines, and 846 who received placebo (a pretend treatment). Key features of dependent drug use are compulsive use, loss of control over use and withdrawal symptoms on cessation of drug use. This review included studies where participants were described as dependent or were likely to be dependent based on cannabis use occurring several days a week, or daily. 
The mean age of participants in individual studies ranged from 22 to 41 years, excluding three studies that targeted young people. Most (75%) study participants were male. Most (16) of the studies were undertaken in the USA, with three occurring in Australia, one in Canada and one in Israel. The studies tested a wide range of medicines to reduce the symptoms of cannabis withdrawal and to promote cessation or reduction of cannabis use. 
Four studies received study medicines from the manufacturing pharmaceutical company but none were funded by pharmaceutical companies. One study did not report funding or medicine source. 
Key results 
For the outcome of abstinence at the end of treatment, Δ9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the major constituent in cannabis) preparations were probably ineffective; antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mixed action antidepressants, a medicine called buspirone and a medicine called N‐acetylcysteine may also have been ineffective; and we are uncertain about the effect of anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers. 
For the outcome of completion of the scheduled period of treatment, THC preparations, mixed action antidepressants, anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers may not have been effective, we were uncertain about the effect of SSRI antidepressants, and N‐acetylcysteine probably did not support treatment completion. The use of anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers may have increased the likelihood that people left treatment early. 
THC preparations and N‐acetylcysteine were probably no more likely to cause side effects than placebo, mixed action antidepressants and buspirone may have been no more likely to cause side effects than placebo, and we were uncertain about SSRI antidepressants. 
Based on current research, all medicines should be considered still experimental.
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence for many of the outcomes in this review was low or very low because each medicine was investigated by a small number of studies (ranging from one to four), each study involved small numbers of participants, there was some inconsistency in the findings and there was a risk of bias due to study participants dropping out of treatment.","# Plain Language Summary: Medicines for Cannabis Use

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether medicines can help people who use cannabis stop or use less. Researchers searched for studies testing different medications compared to fake pills (placebo) or no treatment.

## Who participated?

The review included 21 studies with 1,755 people total. Most participants were adults between 22 and 41 years old, and about three-quarters were male.

## What medicines were tested?

Researchers studied several types of medicines:
- THC preparations (a form of cannabis itself)
- Antidepressants (medicines for mood)
- Anti-seizure medicines
- Other medications like buspirone and N-acetylcysteine

## What did they find?

**Stopping cannabis use:** None of the medicines tested were better than placebo at helping people stop using cannabis completely.

**Withdrawal symptoms:** THC preparations showed some promise for reducing how bad withdrawal symptoms felt, but other medicines did not help with this.

**Side effects:** The medicines tested were generally safe. They did not cause more side effects than placebo.

**Finishing treatment:** Most medicines did not affect whether people completed treatment. However, anti-seizure medicines made people less likely to finish treatment.

## Bottom line

There is not enough strong evidence that any current medicine works well for cannabis dependence. THC preparations might help a little with withdrawal discomfort, but more research is needed. Scientists recommend testing some of these medicines further.","### Plain Language Summary

**What Was the Study About?**

This study looked at different types of medicine to help people stop or reduce cannabis use. Right now, there aren't any approved medicines for this. The researchers wanted to see which medicines worked best and how safe they were.

**Who Was in the Study?**

- 21 studies involved 1,755 people.
- Most participants were adults aged 22 to 41.
- Most were male.
- A few studies included younger people around age 20.

**What Did the Study Do?**

Researchers compared different medicines with a placebo (a fake treatment) or no medicine. They wanted to check if these medicines could reduce withdrawal symptoms or help people stop using cannabis.

**What Did the Study Find?**

1. **Medicines Tested:**
   - THC preparations
   - SSRI antidepressants
   - Other antidepressants
   - Anticonvulsants and mood stabilizers
   - Buspirone
   - N-acetylcysteine
   - A few others like gabapentin and oxytocin were also looked at.

2. **Effectiveness:**
   - Most medicines, including THC, were not better than placebo in helping people quit cannabis.
   - THC helped a bit with reducing withdrawal symptoms.

3. **Safety:**
   - Most medicines did not cause more bad side effects than the placebo.
   - People were just as likely to finish their treatment whether they took the medicine or the placebo.

4. **Completion of Treatment:**
   - Some medicines, like anticonvulsants, made it harder for people to complete their treatment.

5. **Insufficient Data:**
   - There wasn't enough information to say if gabapentin, oxytocin, or atomoxetine worked well.

**Conclusions:**

- The evidence for these medicines is incomplete and mostly low quality.
- SSRI antidepressants and similar medicines might not be helpful for cannabis dependence.
- THC might help with withdrawal but is still experimental.
- More research is needed on other medicines like gabapentin, oxytocin, and N-acetylcysteine."
"Background
Maternal complications, including psychological/mental health problems and neonatal morbidity, have commonly been observed in the postpartum period. Home visits by health professionals or lay supporters in the weeks following birth may prevent health problems from becoming chronic, with long‐term effects. This is an update of a review last published in 2017. 
Objectives
The primary objective of this review is to assess the effects of different home‐visiting schedules on maternal and newborn mortality during the early postpartum period. The review focuses on the frequency of home visits (how many home visits in total), the timing (when visits started, e.g. within 48 hours of the birth), duration (when visits ended), intensity (how many visits per week), and different types of home‐visiting interventions. 
Search methods
For this update, we searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (19 May 2021), and checked reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (including cluster‐, quasi‐RCTs and studies available only as abstracts) comparing different home‐visiting interventions that enrolled participants in the early postpartum period (up to 42 days after birth) were eligible for inclusion. We excluded studies in which women were enrolled and received an intervention during the antenatal period (even if the intervention continued into the postnatal period), and studies recruiting only women from specific high‐risk groups (e.g. women with alcohol or drug problems). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 16 randomised trials with data for 12,080 women. The trials were carried out in countries across the world, in both high‐ and low‐resource settings. In low‐resource settings, women receiving usual care may have received no additional postnatal care after early hospital discharge. 
The interventions and controls varied considerably across studies. Trials focused on three broad types of comparisons, as detailed below. In all but four of the included studies, postnatal care at home was delivered by healthcare professionals. The aim of all interventions was broadly to assess the well‐being of mothers and babies, and to provide education and support. However, some interventions had more specific aims, such as to encourage breastfeeding, or to provide practical support. 
For most of our outcomes, only one or two studies provided data, and results were inconsistent overall. All studies had several domains with high or unclear risk of bias. 
More versus fewer home visits (five studies, 2102 women) 
The evidence is very uncertain about whether home visits have any effect on maternal and neonatal mortality (very low‐certainty evidence). Mean postnatal depression scores as measured with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) may be slightly higher (worse) with more home visits, though the difference in scores was not clinically meaningful (mean difference (MD) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 1.79; two studies, 767 women; low‐certainty evidence). Two separate analyses indicated conflicting results for maternal satisfaction (both low‐certainty evidence); one indicated that there may be benefit with fewer visits, though the 95% CI just crossed the line of no effect (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.02; two studies, 862 women). However, in another study, the additional support provided by health visitors was associated with increased mean satisfaction scores (MD 14.70, 95% CI 8.43 to 20.97; one study, 280 women; low‐certainty evidence). Infant healthcare utilisation may be decreased with more home visits (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.64; four studies, 1365 infants) and exclusive breastfeeding at six weeks may be increased (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.36; three studies, 960 women; low‐certainty evidence). Serious neonatal morbidity up to six months was not reported in any trial. 
Different models of postnatal care (three studies, 4394 women) 
In a cluster‐RCT comparing usual care with individualised care by midwives, extended up to three months after the birth, there may be little or no difference in neonatal mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.12; one study, 696 infants). The proportion of women with EPDS scores ≥ 13 at four months is probably reduced with individualised care (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.86; one study, 1295 women). One study suggests there may be little to no difference between home visits and telephone screening in neonatal morbidity up to 28 days (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.12; one study, 696 women). In a different study, there was no difference between breastfeeding promotion and routine visits in exclusive breastfeeding rates at six months (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.69; one study, 656 women). 
Home versus facility‐based postnatal care (eight studies, 5179 women) 
The evidence suggests there may be little to no difference in postnatal depression rates at 42 days postpartum and also as measured on an EPDS scale at 60 days. Maternal satisfaction with postnatal care may be better with home visits (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.62; three studies, 2368 women). There may be little to no difference in infant emergency health care visits or infant hospital readmissions (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.38; three studies, 3257 women) or in exclusive breastfeeding at two weeks (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.18; 1 study, 513 women). 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of home visits on maternal and neonatal mortality. Individualised care as part of a package of home visits probably improves depression scores at four months and increasing the frequency of home visits may improve exclusive breastfeeding rates and infant healthcare utilisation. Maternal satisfaction may also be better with home visits compared to hospital check‐ups. Overall, the certainty of evidence was found to be low and findings were not consistent among studies and comparisons. Further well designed RCTs evaluating this complex intervention will be required to formulate the optimal package.","Home visits in the early period after the birth of a baby
What is the issue? 
Health problems for mothers and babies commonly occur or become apparent in the weeks following the birth. For the mothers these include postpartum haemorrhage (substitute excessive blood loss), fever and infection, abdominal and back pain, abnormal discharge (heavy or smelly vaginal discharge), thromboembolism (a blood clot), and urinary tract complications (being unable to control the urge to pee), as well as psychological and mental health problems such as postnatal depression. Mothers may also need support to establish breastfeeding. Babies are at risk of death related to infections (babies may be badly affected by infections), asphyxia (difficulties in breathing, caused by lack of oxygen), and preterm birth (being born prematurely). 
Why is this important? 
Home visits by health professionals or lay supporters in the early postpartum period may prevent health problems from becoming long‐term, with effects on women, their babies, and their families. This review looked at different home‐visiting schedules in the weeks following the birth. 
What evidence did we find? 
We included 16 randomised trials with data for 12,080 women. Some trials focused on physical checks of the mother and newborn, while others provided support for breastfeeding, and one included the provision of practical support with housework and childcare. They were carried out in both high‐resource countries and low‐resource settings where women receiving usual care may not have received additional postnatal care after early hospital discharge. 
The trials focused on three broad types of comparisons: schedules involving more versus fewer postnatal home visits (five studies), schedules involving different models of care (three studies), and home versus facility postnatal check‐ups (eight studies). In all but four of the included studies, postnatal care at home was delivered by healthcare professionals. For most of our outcomes, only one or two studies provided data. Overall, our results were inconsistent. 
The evidence was very uncertain about whether home visits reduced newborn deaths or serious health problems with the mother. Women's physical and psychological health were not improved with more intensive schedules of home visits although more individualised care improved women's mental health in one study and maternal satisfaction was slightly better in two studies. Overall, babies may be less likely to have additional medical care if their mothers received more postnatal home visits. More home visits may have encouraged more women to exclusively breastfeed their babies and women to be more satisfied with their postnatal care. The different outcomes reported in different studies, how the outcomes were measured, and the considerable variation in the interventions and control conditions across studies were limitations of this review. The certainty of the evidence was generally found to be low or very low according to the GRADE criteria. 
What does this mean? 
Increasing the number of postnatal home visits may promote infant health and exclusive breastfeeding and more individualised care may improve outcomes for women. More research is needed before any particular schedule of postnatal care can be recommended.","# Plain Language Summary: Home Visits After Birth

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether visiting new mothers and babies at home after birth helps prevent health problems. Researchers compared different types and amounts of home visits to see what works best.

## Why does this matter?

After giving birth, mothers and newborns can face health challenges. Home visits from nurses, midwives, or trained helpers in the first weeks after birth might catch problems early and prevent them from getting worse.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers reviewed 16 studies involving 12,080 women from around the world. They looked at:
- How many home visits mothers received
- When visits started and stopped
- How often visitors came each week
- Who did the visits (doctors, nurses, or trained helpers)

## What did they find?

**More visits versus fewer visits:**
- It's unclear if more visits prevent serious health problems
- More visits might slightly increase sadness feelings, but the difference was small
- More visits may help babies stay healthy and increase breastfeeding
- Mothers had mixed feelings about whether more visits helped

**Different types of home care:**
- Personalized care from midwives probably helped reduce sadness at 4 months
- Home visits and phone check-ups worked about the same
- Breastfeeding promotion didn't clearly help more than regular visits

**Home visits versus hospital check-ups:**
- Both worked about the same for preventing sadness
- Mothers were more satisfied with home visits
- Babies had similar health outcomes either way

## What does this mean?

Home visits after birth may help some mothers feel better and support breastfeeding, but the evidence isn't strong enough to say for certain. More research is needed to figure out the best plan for helping new mothers and babies.","### Plain Language Summary

**Background**  
After having a baby, some mothers and babies can face health problems. Visiting families at home after a baby is born might help avoid long-term health issues. This study looks at how different home visit schedules affect the health of mothers and babies soon after birth.

**Objective**  
The main goal is to see how different plans for home visits affect the health and well-being of mothers and newborns. This includes how often visits happen, when they start and end, how intense they are, and the types of visits.

**Methods**  
Researchers looked at several studies from around the world, focusing on home visits scheduled within six weeks after birth. They did not include studies that started before birth or targeted only high-risk groups.

**Who Participated?**  
The review analyzed 16 studies with data from over 12,000 women from various countries.

**Key Findings**  
1. **Number of Visits**: There's not enough evidence to confirm that more home visits save lives, but they might help reduce baby doctor visits and increase breastfeeding rates.
2. **Types of Care**: Custom care by midwives might slightly reduce depression in moms at four months, but doesn’t seem to impact the baby’s health up to one month.
3. **Home vs. Hospital**: Moms might feel more satisfied with home visits compared to hospital check-ups, but there’s little difference in baby emergency care or breastfeeding rates.

**Safety and Outcomes**  
More home visits might improve some outcomes like mom’s satisfaction and breastfeeding, but the overall evidence is not very strong or clear.

**Conclusion**  
We still don’t know exactly how helpful home visits are for saving lives or preventing serious health problems. More well-planned studies are needed to find the best way to support moms and babies after birth."
"Background
It remains unclear whether people with non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) benefit from intravesical gemcitabine compared to other agents in the primary or recurrent setting following transurethral resection of a bladder tumor. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2012. Since that time, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been reported, making this update relevant.  
Objectives
To assess the comparative effectiveness and toxicity of intravesical gemcitabine instillation for NMIBC. 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive literature search of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, trial registries, and conference proceedings to 11 September 2020, with no restrictions on the language or status of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs in which participants received intravesical gemcitabine for primary or recurrent NMIBC. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the included studies and extracted data for the primary outcomes: time to recurrence, time to progression, grade III to V adverse events determined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0), and the secondary outcomes: time to death from bladder cancer, time to death from any cause, grade I or II adverse events determined by the CTCAE v5.0 and disease‐specific quality of life. We performed statistical analyses using a random‐effects model and rated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included seven studies with 1222 participants with NMIBC across five comparisons. This abstract focuses on the primary outcomes of the three most clinically relevant comparisons. 
1. Gemcitabine versus saline: based on two years' to four years' follow‐up, gemcitabine may reduce the risk of recurrence over time compared to saline (39% versus 47% recurrence rate, hazard ratio [HR] 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54 to 1.09; studies = 2, participants = 734; I2 = 49%; low‐certainty evidence), but the CI included the possibility of no effect.  Gemcitabine may result in little to no difference in the risk of progression over time compared to saline (4.6% versus 4.8% progression rate, HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.19 to 4.71; studies = 2, participants = 654; I2 = 53%; low‐certainty evidence).  Gemcitabine may result in little to no difference in the CTCAE grade III to V adverse events compared to saline (5.9% versus 4.7% adverse events rate, risk ratio [RR] 1.26, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.75; studies = 2, participants = 668; I2 = 24%; low‐certainty evidence).  
2. Gemcitabine versus mitomycin: based on three years' follow‐up (studies = 1, participants = 109), gemcitabine may reduce the risk of recurrence over time compared to mitomycin (17% versus 40% recurrence rate, HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.69; low‐certainty evidence). Gemcitabine may reduce the risk of progression over time compared to mitomycin (11% versus  18% progression rate, HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.01; low‐certainty evidence), but the CI included the possibility of no effect.  We are very uncertain about the effect of gemcitabine on the CTCAE grade III to V adverse events compared to mitomycin (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.93; very low‐certainty evidence). The analysis was only based on recurrent NMIBC. 
3. Gemcitabine versus Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin (BCG) for recurrent (one‐course BCG failure) high‐risk NMIBC: based on 6 months' to 22 months' follow‐up (studies = 1, participants = 80), gemcitabine may reduce the risk of recurrence compared to BCG (41% versus 97% recurrence rate, HR 0.15, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.26; low‐certainty evidence) and progression over time (16% versus 33% progression rate, HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.76; low‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effect of gemcitabine on the CTCAE grade III to V adverse events compared to BCG (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.66; very low‐certainty evidence).  
In addition, the review provides information on  the comparison of gemcitabine versus BCG and gemcitabine versus one‐third dose BCG.  
Authors' conclusions
Based on findings of this review, gemcitabine may have a more favorable impact on recurrence and progression‐free survival than mitomycin but we are very uncertain as to how major adverse events compare. The same is true when comparing gemcitabine to BCG in individuals with high risk disease who have previously failed BCG. The underlying low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence indicates that our confidence in these results is limited; the true effects may be substantially different from these findings; therefore, better quality studies are needed.","Intravesical gemcitabine for non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer
Review question 
In people with tumors of the superficial layer of the urinary bladder (namely non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer [NMIBC]), how does gemcitabine that is put into the bladder compare to other medicines after the tumor has been removed?  
Background 
NMIBC can be taken out of the bladder using small instruments and a light source (called transurethral surgery). However, these tumors often come back (recurrence) with an aggressive feature such as spread into the deep layers of the bladder. To prevent this, we can put various medicines into the bladder. In this review, we wanted to know whether gemcitabine (a chemotherapy medication) was better or worse than other medicines. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to 11 September 2020. We included only studies in which chance determined whether people received gemcitabine or other medicines. We found seven studies with 1222 participants. Two studies compared gemcitabine versus saline. One study compared gemcitabine versus mitomycin (a chemotherapy medication). Three studies compared gemcitabine versus BCG (Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin; a medicine used to help keep cancer from growing). One study compared gemcitabine versus one‐third dose BCG. 
Key results 
Gemcitabine may reduce the risk of recurrence over time, but may have a similar effect on progression (cancer getting worse) and severe unwanted effects compared to saline. Gemcitabine may prevent recurrence and progression compared to mitomycin. We are very unsure about the effect of gemcitabine on the severe unwanted effects compared to mitomycin. In people who had a high‐risk NMIBC with the cancer coming back after one course of treatment with BCG, gemcitabine may cause less tumor recurrence and progression compared to giving BCG again. We are very unsure about the effect of gemcitabine on the severe unwanted effects compared to BCG retreatment. The review also includes information on how gemcitabine compares to BCG and how it compares to one‐third dose BCG.  
Reliability of the evidence 
The reliability of the evidence was low or very low for most of the treatments we compared, meaning that we were often uncertain about whether the findings were true. Further research will likely change these findings.","# Plain Language Summary: Gemcitabine for Bladder Cancer

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether a medicine called gemcitabine works well for treating a type of bladder cancer called non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Doctors put gemcitabine directly into the bladder through a tube. The researchers wanted to know if gemcitabine works better than other treatments and if it causes serious side effects.

## Who was studied?

The review included 1,222 people with NMIBC across seven different studies. These patients had bladder cancer that either came back or was new.

## What were the main findings?

**Gemcitabine compared to salt water:**
- Gemcitabine may slightly lower the chance that cancer comes back (39% versus 47%)
- It probably doesn't make much difference in whether cancer spreads
- Serious side effects were about the same

**Gemcitabine compared to mitomycin (another medicine):**
- Gemcitabine may work better at stopping cancer from coming back (17% versus 40%)
- It may help prevent cancer from spreading
- We don't know enough about serious side effects

**Gemcitabine compared to BCG (a common bladder cancer treatment) for patients whose cancer came back:**
- Gemcitabine may work much better at stopping cancer from coming back (41% versus 97%)
- It may help prevent cancer from spreading
- Serious side effects were about the same

## What does this mean?

Gemcitabine may be helpful for some bladder cancer patients, especially those whose cancer has come back after other treatments. However, the studies weren't strong enough to be completely sure. Doctors need better research to know for certain.","### Plain Language Summary

#### What is the study about?

This study looks at whether a medicine called gemcitabine is helpful for people with a type of bladder condition called non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Researchers want to see if gemcitabine works better or has fewer side effects compared to other treatments.

#### Who is in the study?

The study includes 1,222 people with NMIBC who have tried different treatments to see how gemcitabine compares.

#### What treatments were tested?

The study compares gemcitabine to three other treatments:
1. Saline
2. Mitomycin
3. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), especially for those who did not do well with BCG before.

#### What did the researchers find?

1. **Gemcitabine vs. Saline:**
   - Gemcitabine might lower the chances of NMIBC coming back (39% vs. 47%).
   - It doesn’t seem to make much difference in major side effects or in slowing down the condition’s progress.

2. **Gemcitabine vs. Mitomycin:**
   - Gemcitabine might be better at stopping the condition from coming back (17% vs. 40%).
   - It could also help slow down the condition’s progress, but there's some uncertainty about major side effects.

3. **Gemcitabine vs. BCG:**
   - For those who didn’t respond to BCG before, gemcitabine might lower the chances of the condition coming back (41% vs. 97%).
   - It might also slow down the condition’s progress.

#### Are the results certain?

The study results are uncertain, meaning the findings might change with more research. Better quality studies are needed to confirm these results.

#### How long did the study take?

The participants were followed for different lengths of time, from 6 months to 4 years, depending on the comparison.

#### What about safety?

The study looks at side effects, but there’s not enough reliable information to be sure about how gemcitabine compares to others in terms of serious side effects.

### Conclusion

Gemcitabine might be more effective than some other treatments at keeping NMIBC from coming back. However, the certainty of the results is low, and more high-quality studies are needed to know for sure."
"Background
Multiple risk factor interventions using counselling and educational methods assumed to be efficacious and cost‐effective in reducing coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality and morbidity and that they should be expanded. Trials examining risk factor changes have cast doubt on the effectiveness of these interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of multiple risk factor interventions for reducing total mortality, fatal and non‐fatal events from CHD and cardiovascular risk factors among adults assumed to be without prior clinical evidence CHD.. 
Search methods
We updated the original search BY SEARCHING CENTRAL (2006, Issue 2), MEDLINE (2000 to June 2006) and EMBASE (1998 to June 2006), and checking bibliographies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of more than six months duration using counselling or education to modify more than one cardiovascular risk factor in adults from general populations, occupational groups or specific risk factors (i.e. diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, obesity). 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors extracted data independently. We expressed categorical variables as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where studies published subsequent follow‐up data on mortality and event rates, we updated these data. 
Main results
We found 55 trials (163,471 participants) with a median duration of 12 month follow up. Fourteen trials (139,256 participants) with reported clinical event endpoints, the pooled ORs for total and CHD mortality were 1.00 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.05) and 0.99 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.07), respectively. Total mortality and combined fatal and non‐fatal cardiovascular events showed benefits from intervention when confined to trials involving people with hypertension (16 trials) and diabetes (5 trials): OR 0.78 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.89) and OR 0.71 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.83), respectively. Net changes (weighted mean differences) in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (53 trials) and blood cholesterol (50 trials) were ‐2.71 mmHg (95% CI ‐3.49 to ‐1.93), ‐2.13 mmHg (95% CI ‐2.67 to ‐1.58 ) and ‐0.24 mmol/l (95% CI ‐0.32 to ‐0.16), respectively. The OR for reduction in smoking prevalence (20 trials) was 0.87 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.00). Marked heterogeneity (I2 > 85%) for all risk factor analyses was not explained by co‐morbidities, allocation concealment, use of antihypertensive or cholesterol‐lowering drugs, or by age of trial. 
Authors' conclusions
Interventions using counselling and education aimed at behaviour change do not reduce total or CHD mortality or clinical events in general populations but may be effective in reducing mortality in high‐risk hypertensive and diabetic populations. Risk factor declines were modest but owing to marked unexplained heterogeneity between trials, the pooled estimates are of dubious validity. Evidence suggests that health promotion interventions have limited use in general populations.","Multiple risk factor interventions for coronary heart disease
In many countries, there is enthusiasm for 'healthy heart programmes' that use counselling and educational methods to encourage people to reduce their risks for developing heart disease. These risk factors include high cholesterol, excessive salt intake, high blood pressure, excess weight, a high‐fat diet, smoking, diabetes and a sedentary lifestyle. This review is an update of all relevant randomised trials that have evaluated an intervention that aimed to reduce more than one risk factor (multiple risk factor intervention) in people without evidence of cardiovascular disease. The findings are from 55 trials of between six months and 12 years duration conducted in several countries over the course of four decades. The median duration of follow up was 12 months (with a range of six months to 12 years). Multiple risk factor intervention does result in small reductions in risk factors including blood pressure, cholesterol and smoking. Contrary to expectations, multiple risk factor interventions had little or no impact on the risk of coronary heart disease mortality or morbidity. This could be because these small risk factor changes were not maintained in the long term. Alternatively, the small reductions in risk factors may be caused by biases in some of the studies. The methods of attempting behaviour change in the general population are limited and do not appear to be effective. Different approaches to behaviour change are needed and should be tested empirically before being widely promoted, particularly in developing countries where cardiovascular disease rates are rising. Further trials may be warranted.","# Plain Language Summary

## What is this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if teaching people about heart health and giving them counseling helps prevent heart disease and death. Many people believed these programs worked well and should be used more often. This study looked at 55 different research projects to see if that was true.

## Who was in the study?

The study included 163,471 adults from regular communities, workplaces, and people with health conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol. None of them had a history of heart disease before the study started.

## What did researchers do?

They looked at studies where people received counseling or education to help them change habits that affect heart health (like diet, exercise, smoking, and managing blood pressure or cholesterol). Most studies lasted about 12 months.

## What did they find?

**Main results:**
- For most people, counseling and education did **not** reduce deaths or heart attacks
- However, for people with **high blood pressure or diabetes**, these programs **did help** reduce deaths and heart problems
- Blood pressure dropped slightly (about 2-3 points)
- Cholesterol dropped a little bit
- Fewer people quit smoking than expected

## What does this mean?

Teaching people about heart health works best for those already at high risk (like people with high blood pressure or diabetes). For healthy people in general, these programs don't seem to prevent heart disease or death as much as doctors hoped.","### Summary of the Study

#### Purpose
The study focused on understanding if programs that use counseling and education can help reduce heart disease and related health problems in adults who haven't had heart disease before.

#### Who was in the Study?
The study looked at 55 trials with a total of 163,471 adults. These people came from different backgrounds, including some with health issues like high blood pressure and diabetes.

#### What Did They Do?
The trials used counseling or education to help change more than one heart-related risk factor, like high blood pressure or cholesterol, over a period of more than six months.

#### What Did They Find?
1. **General Population:**
   - No clear reduction in overall deaths or heart-related events.
   - Little change in key risk factors.

2. **High-Risk Groups (e.g., people with high blood pressure and diabetes):**
   - Some benefits were seen, like fewer deaths.
   - Blood pressure and cholesterol levels lowered slightly.
   - Slight reduction in smoking rates.

3. **Unexpected Differences:**
   - There were big differences in results between different trials that couldn't be explained.

#### Conclusion
Counseling and education alone don't seem to help the general population much. They might benefit people at higher risk, like those with high blood pressure or diabetes. However, changes were small, and the overall usefulness is limited."
"Background
During in vitro fertilisation (IVF) procedures, human preimplantation embryos are cultured in the laboratory. While some laboratories culture in an atmospheric oxygen concentration (˜ 20%), others use a lower concentration (˜ 5%) as this is more comparable to the oxygen concentration observed in the oviduct and the uterus. Animal studies have shown that high oxygen concentration could have a negative impact on embryo quality via reactive oxygen species causing oxidative stress. In humans, it is currently unknown which oxygen concentration provides the best success rates of IVF procedures, eventually resulting in the hightest birth rate of healthy newborns. 
Objectives
To determine whether embryo culture at low oxygen concentrations improves treatment outcome (better embryo development and more pregnancies and live births) in IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) as compared to embryo culture at atmospheric oxygen concentrations. 
Search methods
The Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO electronic databases were searched (up to 4th November 2011) for randomised controlled trials on the effect of low oxygen concentrations for human embryo culture. Furthermore, reference lists of all obtained studies were checked and conference abstracts handsearched. 
Selection criteria
Only truly randomised controlled trials comparing embryo culture at low oxygen concentrations (˜ 5%) with embryo culture at atmospheric oxygen concentrations (˜ 20%) were included in this systematic review and meta‐analysis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors selected the trials for inclusion according to the above criteria. After that two authors independently extracted the data for subsequent analysis, and one author functioned as a referee in case of ambiguities. The statistical analysis was performed in accordance with the guidelines developed by The Cochrane Collaboration. 
Main results
Seven studies with a total of 2422 participants were included in this systematic review. Meta‐analysis could be performed with the data of four included studies, with a total of 1382 participants. The methodological quality of the included trials was relatively low. Evidence of a beneficial effect of culturing in low oxygen concentration was found for live birth rate (OR 1.39; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.76; P = 0.005; I2 = 0%); this would mean that a typical clinic could improve a 30% live birth rate using atmospheric oxygen concentration to somewhere between 32% and 43% by using a low oxygen concentration. The results were very similar for ongoing and clinical pregnancy rates. There was no evidence that culturing embryos under low oxygen concentrations resulted in higher numbers of adverse events such as multiple pregnancies, miscarriages or congenital abnormalities. 
Authors' conclusions
The results of this systematic review and meta‐analysis suggest that culturing embryos under conditions with low oxygen concentrations improves the success rates of IVF and ICSI, resulting in the birth of more healthy newborns.","Low oxygen concentrations for embryo culture in In vitro fertilisation
Couples who experience difficulty conceiving are commonly referred for assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) as a way to achieve pregnancy. Over 3.5 million babies have been born worldwide from IVF and ICSI procedures. One of the main focuses of research in reproductive medicine is to optimise the treatment success of IVF and ICSI procedures. One such area has focused on improving the in vitro environment to which human embryos are exposed before implantation into the uterus. An important component of this in vitro environment is the oxygen concentration. Traditionally, embryos have been cultured under atmospheric oxygen concentrations (˜ 20%), probably because culturing at lower oxygen concentration requires additional expenses. More recently there has been a shift towards the use of lower oxygen concentrations (˜ 5%) as these more closely resemble the oxygen concentration under natural conditions (2% to 8%). The results of clinical studies that have been undertaken to study the effect on the outcomes of IVF and ICSI procedures of culturing embryos under low oxygen concentrations have been conflicting. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis of the literature to find the best available evidence. It has shown that culturing embryos under low oxygen concentrations does indeed improve clinical outcomes after IVF and ICSI, such as number of deliveries (live birth rate) and ongoing and clinical pregnancy rates. Furthermore, no evidence was found of an increased risk of adverse events such as multiple pregnancies, miscarriages and congenital abnormalities. We concluded that culturing embryos under low oxygen concentrations seems beneficial with an increase in the number of newborns, but more studies are needed to strongly prove this effect.","# Plain Language Summary: Oxygen Levels During Fertility Treatment

## What is this study about?

When doctors help people get pregnant using in vitro fertilization (IVF), they grow embryos (very early babies) in the laboratory before placing them in the uterus. This study looked at whether the amount of oxygen used during this growth process affects how well the treatment works.

## The Question

Laboratories use different oxygen levels when growing embryos. Some use the oxygen level found in regular air (about 20%), while others use a lower level (about 5%), which is closer to what's found naturally inside the female body. Scientists wanted to know: **Does using lower oxygen help embryos develop better and lead to more successful pregnancies and healthy babies?**

## What They Did

Researchers looked at seven studies involving 2,422 people who were trying to get pregnant using IVF or a similar treatment called ICSI. They compared results between people whose embryos were grown in regular air oxygen levels versus lower oxygen levels.

## What They Found

- **Better success rates**: Embryos grown in lower oxygen had better chances of resulting in live births. If a clinic normally had a 30% success rate with regular oxygen, switching to lower oxygen could improve that to between 32% and 43%.
- **Similar pregnancy results**: Pregnancy rates were also better with lower oxygen.
- **No safety concerns**: There were no signs of more problems like multiple pregnancies, miscarriages, or birth defects.

## Bottom Line

The evidence suggests that growing embryos in lower oxygen conditions during fertility treatment helps more people have successful pregnancies and healthy babies.","### Plain Language Summary

**Background:**
When doctors help people have babies using a method called IVF, they grow tiny embryos in the lab. Some labs use a normal amount of oxygen, like in the air (about 20%), but others use less oxygen (about 5%) because it's more like what's in the body. Animal tests show that too much oxygen might harm embryos, but we don't know which is best for human embryos to help more babies be born.

**Objective:**
This study wants to find out if using less oxygen helps embryos grow better, leading to more pregnancies and healthy births in IVF treatments compared to normal air oxygen.

**What They Did:**
The researchers looked at many scientific papers up to 2011 that tested low oxygen on embryos. They picked only truly random studies that compared less oxygen to normal oxygen levels.

**How They Studied It:**
Two researchers picked the right studies, and they worked together to collect the information. Another person was there to help if they had questions. They followed special rules to analyze the data correctly.

**Results:**
They found seven studies with 2,422 people. They could use four of these studies with 1,382 people to analyze. The studies were not the best quality. They discovered that using less oxygen might improve the chance of having a healthy baby. Instead of a 30% chance with normal oxygen, it could be between 32% and 43% with less oxygen. Other pregnancy results were similar, and using less oxygen didn't cause more problems like twins, miscarriage, or birth defects.

**Conclusion:**
The study suggests that using less oxygen when growing embryos could help more healthy babies be born with IVF treatments."
"Background
Current standard treatment for patients with cervical cancer who have locally advanced stage disease (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIB to IVA) is concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT). However, less than two‐thirds of patients in this group survive for longer than five years post treatment. Adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) can be given in an attempt to improve survival by eradicating residual disease in the pelvis and treating occult disease outside the pelvic radiation field. However, inconsistency in trial design, inclusion criteria for participants, interventions and survival benefit has been noted among trials of ACT after CCRT for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). 
Objectives
To evaluate the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) after concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) on survival of women with locally advanced cervical cancer compared with CCRT alone. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Review Group Trial Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and conference proceedings to March 2014. We handsearched citation lists of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CCRT alone versus CCRT plus ACT were included. Patients were diagnosed with cervical cancer FIGO stage IIB to IVA with a histopathology of squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (ST, KK) selected relevant trials, extracted data, assessed risk of bias independently, compared results and resolved disagreements by discussion. 
Main results
We identified two RCTs involving 978 women with cervical cancer stage IIB to IVA. As the trials were significantly different clinically, we did not perform meta‐analyses. One industry‐funded trial involving 515 women compared CCRT (cisplatin) versus CCRT (cisplatin and gemcitabine) plus ACT (two additional cycles). This trial reported significant improvement in progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in women who were given CCRT plus ACT compared with those treated with CCRT alone: Three‐year PFS was 74.4% versus 65.0% (hazard ratio (HR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.95, P value 0.027), and three‐year OS was 80% versus 69% (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.95, P value 0.022). However, as the CCRT chemotherapy differed between the two arms, we considered the findings to be at high risk of bias. 
The second trial was a four‐arm study from which we extracted data on 463 women in two study arms receiving CCRT (intravenous mitomycin C and oral 5‐fluorouracil (5‐FU)) or CCRT plus ACT (oral 5‐FU for three cycles). The HR for OS in women who received ACT after CCRT compared with the HR for OS in those who were given CCRT alone was 1.309 (95% CI 0.795 to 2.157), and the HR for disease‐free survival (DFS) was 1.125 (95% CI 0.799 to 1.586). 
Haematological adverse events were more common in the ACT arms of both trials. Quality of life (QoL) was not reported in either trial. 
Authors' conclusions
With limited data from only two trials, we found insufficient evidence to support the use of ACT after CCRT. Future large trials are required to demonstrate efficacy, toxicities and QoL.","Can additional chemotherapy after initial treatment for locally advanced stage cervical cancer reduce recurrence and extend life? 
The issue 
Standard treatment for locally advanced stage cervical cancer (stage IIB to IVA) is 'concurrent chemoradiation' when anticancer drugs are given during the same treatment period as pelvic radiotherapy (radiation therapy to lower abdomen). However, the tumour may remain (residual cancer) or may come back (recurrent cancer) after this standard treatment. This review evaluated whether giving additional anticancer drugs (ACTs) after standard treatment could help women with locally advanced cervical cancer to live longer compared with standard treatment alone. 
How we conducted the review 
We searched the literature to March 2014 and identified two randomised controlled trials comparing standard treatment versus standard treatment plus ACT in women with locally advanced cervical cancer. Two review authors assessed these studies and collected data independently. 
Findings 
The two studies were very different; therefore we could not pool their data. One trial conducted internationally between 2002 and 2004, involving 515 women, found that cancer took longer to return in women receiving ACT (cisplatin and gemcitabine), and more women in the ACT group were alive after three years than in the standard treatment group (80% versus 69%). We considered the findings to be at high risk of bias in this trial, as women were given different drugs during standard treatment, and so the overall effect of the study treatment could not be attributed to the ACT alone. The other trial, which was conducted in several hospitals in Thailand between 1988 and 1994, involved 463 women. ACT (5‐fluorouracil) did not improve the length of survival or the time taken for cancer to return in women in this trial. A trend towards increased side effects was reported in the ACT arms of both studies. 
Conclusions 
We found insufficient evidence to support giving additional anticancer drugs to women who have received standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer, as currently only limited data are available from two very different trials.","# Plain Language Summary: Cervical Cancer Treatment Study

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether adding extra chemotherapy (cancer medicine) after radiation treatment helps women with advanced cervical cancer live longer.

## Who is this for?

Women with cervical cancer that has spread within the pelvis (the area in the lower belly) but not to distant parts of the body.

## Current treatment

The standard treatment for this type of cancer is chemotherapy given at the same time as radiation therapy. However, only about 2 out of 3 women survive for 5 years or longer after this treatment.

## What researchers wanted to know

Does giving extra chemotherapy after the radiation and chemotherapy treatment help women survive longer?

## What they found

Researchers looked at 2 studies involving 978 women total:

- **Study 1** (515 women): Women who got extra chemotherapy after radiation had better survival rates. About 80% survived 3 years compared to 69% who didn't get the extra chemotherapy.

- **Study 2** (463 women): Extra chemotherapy did not improve survival compared to radiation and chemotherapy alone.

## Side effects

Women who received the extra chemotherapy had more blood-related side effects (like low blood cell counts).

## Bottom line

There isn't enough evidence yet to say whether extra chemotherapy after radiation helps women with advanced cervical cancer. More research is needed to find the best treatment approach and understand how it affects quality of life.","**Study Summary**

**Purpose:**  
This study looked at whether adding extra chemotherapy (called adjuvant chemotherapy or ACT) after the usual treatment of chemotherapy and radiation (CCRT) could help women with advanced cervical cancer live longer.

**Who Participated:**  
Women with advanced cervical cancer were included in the study.

**What Was Tested:**  
- Group 1: Received the standard treatment of CCRT.
- Group 2: Received CCRT followed by extra chemotherapy (ACT).

**Key Findings:**  
- One study, involving 515 women, showed that combining CCRT with ACT improved survival rates compared to CCRT alone. However, there might be issues with how this study was set up, making the results less reliable.
- Another study with 463 women did not show clear benefits of adding ACT.

**Safety:**  
Side effects related to blood problems were more common in the group receiving ACT.

**Conclusion:**  
There is not enough evidence to recommend adding extra chemotherapy after CCRT. More research is needed to better understand its effectiveness and impact on quality of life."
"Background
Young women, especially adolescents, often lack access to modern contraception. Reasons vary by geography and regional politics and culture. The projected 2015 birth rate in 'developing' regions was 56 per 1000 compared with 17 per 1000 for 'developed' regions. 
Objectives
To identify school‐based interventions that improved contraceptive use among adolescents
Search methods
Until 6 June 2016, we searched for eligible trials in PubMed, CENTRAL, ERIC, Web of Science, POPLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. 
Selection criteria
We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assigned individuals or clusters. The majority of participants must have been 19 years old or younger. 
The educational strategy must have occurred primarily in a middle school or high school. The intervention had to emphasize one or more effective methods of contraception. Our primary outcomes were pregnancy and contraceptive use. 
Data collection and analysis
We assessed titles and abstracts identified during the searches. One author extracted and entered the data into RevMan; a second author verified accuracy. We examined studies for methodological quality. 
For unadjusted dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the Mantel‐Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For cluster randomized trials, we used adjusted measures, e.g. OR, risk ratio, or difference in proportions. For continuous outcomes, we used the adjusted mean difference (MD) or other measures from the models. We did not conduct meta‐analysis due to varied interventions and outcome measures. 
Main results
The 11 trials included 10 cluster RCTs and an individually randomized trial. The cluster RCTs had sample sizes from 816 to 10,954; the median number of clusters was 24. Most trials were conducted in the USA and UK; one was from Mexico and one from South Africa. 
We focus here on the trials with moderate quality evidence and an intervention effect. Three addressed preventing pregnancy and HIV/STI through interactive sessions. One trial provided a multifaceted two‐year program. Immediately after year one and 12 months after year two, the intervention group was more likely than the standard‐curriculum group to report using effective contraception during last sex (reported adjusted ORs 1.62 ± standard error (SE) 0.22) and 1.76 ± SE 0.29), condom use during last sex (reported adjusted ORs 1.91 ± SE 0.27 and 1.68 ± SE 0.25), and less frequent sex without a condom in the past three months (reported ratios of adjusted means 0.50 ± SE 0.31 and 0.63 ± SE 0.23). Another trial compared multifaceted two‐year programs on sexual risk reduction and risk avoidance (abstinence‐focused) versus usual health education. At 3 months, the risk reduction group was less likely than the usual‐education group to report no condom use at last intercourse (reported adjusted OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.96) and sex without a condom in the last three months (reported adjusted OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.95). At 3 and after 15 months, the risk avoidance group was also less likely than the usual‐education group to report no condom use at last intercourse (reported adjusted ORs 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.93; and 0.61, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.85). At the same time points, the risk reduction group had a higher score than the usual‐education group for condom knowledge. The third trial provided a peer‐led program with eight interactive sessions. At 17 months, the intervention group was less likely than the teacher‐led group to report oral contraceptive use during last sex (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.91). This difference may not have been significant if the investigators had adjusted for the clustering. At 5 and 17 months, the peer‐led group had a greater mean increase in knowledge of HIV and pregnancy prevention compared with the control group. An additional trial showed an effect on knowledge only. The group with an emergency contraception (EC) session was more likely than the group without the EC unit to know the time limits for using hormonal EC (pill) and the non‐hormonal IUD as EC. 
Authors' conclusions
Since most trials addressed preventing STI/HIV and pregnancy, they emphasized condom use. However, several studies covered a range of contraceptive methods. The overall quality of evidence was low. Main reasons for downgrading the evidence were having limited information on intervention fidelity, analyzing a subsample rather than all those randomized, and having high losses.","School‐based programs to improve birth control use among adolescents
Background 
Adolescents have high rates of unplanned pregnancy. They may not have family planning services nearby or know how to get modern birth control. We wanted to find programs in schools that helped teenagers learn about birth control. 
Methods 
We did computer searches for randomized trials until 6 June 2016. Programs included in this review must have occurred in a school, such as a middle school or high school. The programs tried to improve birth control use among teenagers. They also had to emphasize one or more methods of birth control known to work well. 
Results 
We found 11 trials. One study was small, and the other 10 had 816 to 10,954 participants. Six studies were from the USA, three were from the UK, and one each came from Mexico and South Africa. We focus here on three programs that had some effect and were good quality. All three involved students in a variety of activities versus usual sex education. After a two‐year program, the intervention group reported more use of birth control as well as condoms during last sex than the group with standard classes. Another study lasting two years provided two different programs. The intent was to avoid risk by not having sex until marriage or to reduce risk by delaying sex until older. The control group had usual health education. The programs for avoiding risk and reducing risk showed fewer reports of sex without using birth control or condoms. The third study had peers lead eight sessions of educational activities. The program showed less birth control use compared with teacher education but the researchers did not adjust for the study design. 
Of the other eight studies, one had good quality results. The intervention group knew the time limits for using emergency contraception. Six of seven studies with low or very low quality results reported some program effect, such as more condom or contraceptive use or more knowledge of condoms. 
Authors' conclusions 
Since most trials aimed to prevent STI/HIV and pregnancy, they focused on condom use. However, several studies covered a variety of birth control methods. The overall quality of results was low. Some trials lacked information on how their programs worked. Many analyzed subsamples rather than all students in the study, and most had high losses.","# Plain Language Summary: School-Based Programs to Help Teens Use Birth Control

## What is this study about?

This review looked at school programs designed to teach teenagers about birth control and help them use it. Researchers wanted to know which programs actually work.

## Why does this matter?

Many young women, especially teenagers in developing countries, don't have easy access to birth control. This can lead to more unplanned pregnancies. Schools can be a good place to teach teens about their options.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for studies testing school programs about birth control from the year 2000 through June 2016. They looked for studies that:
- Tested programs in middle or high schools
- Included mostly students 19 years old or younger
- Taught about different types of birth control
- Measured whether students actually used birth control or got pregnant

They found 11 studies to review, mostly from the USA and UK, with a few from Mexico and South Africa.

## What did they find?

**Programs that worked:**

Three programs showed good results:
- **Interactive classroom sessions** about preventing pregnancy and STIs: Students who took these classes were more likely to use birth control and condoms during sex
- **Two-year programs** comparing two teaching styles: Both styles helped students use condoms more often
- **Peer-led sessions** (taught by other students): Students learned more about pregnancy and HIV prevention

One program only improved students' **knowledge** about emergency birth control, but didn't measure if they actually used it.

## Important notes

- Most programs focused on condoms, but some taught about other birth control methods too
- The quality of the evidence was low because studies didn't always track all students or provide complete information
- Results were strongest right after the programs and 12-17 months later","### Summary of the Study

**Purpose of the Study:**
The study aimed to find ways to help young women, especially teenagers, use contraceptives more effectively by focusing on school-based programs.

**Who Was Involved:**
The study looked at research involving participants aged 19 or younger. Most of the research happened in middle and high schools.

**What Was Studied:**
The focus was on programs that taught about contraception during school. The main outcomes measured were pregnancy rates and contraceptive use.

**How the Study Was Done:**
Researchers reviewed different studies and picked those that used a scientific method called randomized controlled trials. They analyzed how well the programs worked and how data was collected.

**Results:**
1. **Interactive Sessions:**
   - Programs that included interactive lessons showed a positive impact. One program lasted two years and led to more students using effective contraception and condoms.

2. **Risk Reduction vs. Risk Avoidance:**
   - Programs teaching about risk reduction had better results compared to usual health classes. Students in these programs were more likely to use condoms.

3. **Peer-led vs. Teacher-led:**
   - Programs led by peers instead of teachers boosted knowledge about preventing HIV and pregnancy.

4. **Emergency Contraception:**
   - Lessons about emergency contraception improved students' understanding of how and when to use it.

**Conclusion:**
While many studies focused on preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, they often highlighted the importance of using condoms. However, the quality of the evidence was low, mainly because some important information was missing, and many studies did not include all participants initially involved.

**Safety and Timeline:**
The study did not provide specific information on the safety of interventions, but it included results up to 17 months after programs were completed."
"Background
Coenzyme Q10, or ubiquinone, is a non‐prescription nutritional supplement. It is a fat‐soluble molecule that acts as an electron carrier in mitochondria, and as a coenzyme for mitochondrial enzymes. Coenzyme Q10 deficiency may be associated with a multitude of diseases, including heart failure. The severity of heart failure correlates with the severity of coenzyme Q10 deficiency. Emerging data suggest that the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species are increased in people with heart failure, and coenzyme Q10 may help to reduce these toxic effects because of its antioxidant activity. Coenzyme Q10 may also have a role in stabilising myocardial calcium‐dependent ion channels, and in preventing the consumption of metabolites essential for adenosine‐5'‐triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. Coenzyme Q10, although not a primary recommended treatment, could be beneficial to people with heart failure. Several randomised controlled trials have compared coenzyme Q10 to other therapeutic modalities, but no systematic review of existing randomised trials was conducted prior to the original version of this Cochrane Review, in 2014. 
Objectives
To review the safety and efficacy of coenzyme Q10 in heart failure.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, and AMED on 16 October 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov on 16 July 2020, and the ISRCTN Registry on 11 November 2019. We applied no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of either parallel or cross‐over design that assessed the beneficial and harmful effects of coenzyme Q10 in people with heart failure. When we identified cross‐over studies, we considered data only from the first phase. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods, assessed study risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and GRADE methods to assess the quality of the evidence. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR); for continuous data, the mean difference (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate data were available, we conducted meta‐analysis. When meta‐analysis was not possible, we wrote a narrative synthesis. We provided a PRISMA flow chart to show the flow of study selection. 
Main results
We included eleven studies, with 1573 participants, comparing coenzyme Q10 to placebo or conventional therapy (control). In the majority of the studies, sample size was relatively small. There were important differences among studies in daily coenzyme Q10 dose, follow‐up period, and the measures of treatment effect. All studies had unclear, or high risk of bias, or both, in one or more bias domains. We were only able to conduct meta‐analysis for some of the outcomes. None of the included trials considered quality of life, measured on a validated scale, exercise variables (exercise haemodynamics), or cost‐effectiveness. 
Coenzyme Q10 probably reduces the risk of all‐cause mortality more than control (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.95; 1 study, 420 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 13.3; moderate‐quality evidence). 
There was low‐quality evidence of inconclusive results between the coenzyme Q10 and control groups for the risk of myocardial infarction (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.27 to 9.59; 1 study, 420 participants), and stroke (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.48; 1 study, 420 participants). 
Coenzyme Q10 probably reduces hospitalisation related to heart failure (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.78; 2 studies, 1061 participants; NNTB 9.7; moderate‐quality evidence). 
Very low‐quality evidence suggests that coenzyme Q10 may improve the left ventricular ejection fraction (MD 1.77, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.44; 7 studies, 650 participants), but the results are inconclusive for exercise capacity (MD 48.23, 95% CI ‐24.75 to 121.20; 3 studies, 91 participants); and the risk of developing adverse events (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.10; 2 studies, 568 participants). 
We downgraded the quality of the evidence mainly due to high risk of bias and imprecision.

The included studies provide moderate‐quality evidence that coenzyme Q10 probably reduces all‐cause mortality and hospitalisation for heart failure. There is low‐quality evidence of inconclusive results as to whether coenzyme Q10 has an effect on the risk of myocardial infarction, or stroke. Because of very low‐quality evidence, it is very uncertain whether coenzyme Q10 has an effect on either left ventricular ejection fraction or exercise capacity. There is low‐quality evidence that coenzyme Q10 may increase the risk of adverse effects, or have little to no difference. 
There is currently no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for heart failure. Future trials are needed to confirm our findings.","Coenzyme Q10 for heart failure
Heart failure is a term used to describe the state that develops when the heart cannot maintain adequate cardiac output, or can do so only at the expense of overfilling the heart chambers. People with heart failure commonly experience a relapsing and remitting disease course, with periods of stability and episodes of decompensation (failure to cope with heart damage), leading to worsening symptoms that necessitate hospitalisation. 
Treatment options for heart failure range from drugs to heart transplantation, with each having its own limitations. Coenzyme Q10 (or ubiquinone) has been suggested as a treatment option in some trials. Coenzyme Q10 is a non‐prescription nutritional supplement. It is a fat‐soluble molecule that has a role in energy production within the cells of the body. It may also have antioxidant properties. 
Low levels of coenzyme Q10 may be related to the severity of heart failure. Coenzyme Q10 has been found in all tissues and organs in the body, with the highest concentrations in the heart. Emerging data have suggested that the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species (unstable molecules that contains oxygen and easily reacts with other molecules) are increased in people with heart failure. Because of its antioxidant activity, coenzyme Q10 may help to reduce these toxic effects, which damage the components of the cardiac cells, and disrupt cellular signalling. Coenzyme Q10 plays an important role in conducting signals within the heart muscle and in generating energy.The concentration of coenzyme Q10 has been inversely related to the severity of heart failure. Supplementation with coenzyme Q10 may improve heart failure. Coenzyme Q10 is sometimes used because it is thought to have an acceptable safety profile, with no significant side effects. 
We conducted this review to assess the available evidence on the effects of coenzyme Q10 in people with heart failure. We included 11 randomised controlled trials, involving 1573 participants. They were relatively small, and followed up participants for a relatively short period of time. The analyses show that coenzyme Q10 probably reduces the risk of mortality from all causes, and hospitalisations due to heart failure. It may result in increased, or little or no difference in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or adverse events. The effect of coenzyme Q10 on cardiac function and symptom improvement is uncertain. 
The evidence, current to October 2020, is of a moderate quality at best, because of the high risk of bias in some of the included studies and the absence of precise and consistent results. There is currently no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for heart failure.","# Plain Language Summary: Coenzyme Q10 for Heart Failure

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether a supplement called Coenzyme Q10 (also called ubiquinone) can help people with heart failure. Coenzyme Q10 is a natural substance found in the body that helps cells make energy. Some research suggests it might help protect the heart.

## Who was studied?

Researchers reviewed 11 different studies that included a total of 1,573 people with heart failure. These studies compared people who took Coenzyme Q10 to people who took a placebo (fake pill) or regular heart failure treatments.

## What did researchers do?

They searched medical databases for all studies that tested Coenzyme Q10 in people with heart failure. They looked at whether the supplement helped people live longer, reduced hospital visits, and whether it caused any harmful side effects.

## What did they find?

**Possibly helpful:**
- Coenzyme Q10 probably lowered the risk of death from any cause
- Coenzyme Q10 probably reduced the number of times people had to go to the hospital for heart failure

**Unclear or uncertain:**
- It's not clear if Coenzyme Q10 helps the heart pump better
- It's not clear if it helps people exercise more
- It's not clear if it prevents heart attacks or strokes
- It's not clear if it causes more side effects

## What does this mean?

There is some moderate evidence that Coenzyme Q10 might help, but the evidence is not strong enough to say for sure. More and better studies are needed before doctors can recommend it as a treatment for heart failure.","### Coenzyme Q10 and Heart Health: What We Found

**What is the Study About?**
This study looks at a supplement called Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and how it may help people with heart problems. The main goal was to see if CoQ10 is safe and effective for people with heart failure.

**Who Was in the Study?**
The study included over 1,500 participants with heart failure. They were given either CoQ10 or a placebo (a substance with no active ingredients) to compare results.

**What Did They Do?**
Researchers looked through several databases to find studies that tested CoQ10 in heart failure patients. They found 11 studies to review. These studies had different doses of CoQ10 and lasted for different time periods.

**Key Findings:**

- **Survival Rates:** CoQ10 might help reduce the overall risk of dying from any cause compared to the control group.
  
- **Hospital Visits:** People taking CoQ10 might have fewer hospital visits due to heart issues.

- **Heart Function:** There's some evidence that CoQ10 could improve heart performance, but it’s not strong enough to be certain.

- **Heart Attacks and Strokes:** The effect of CoQ10 on heart attacks and strokes is unclear.

- **Safety:** The risk of side effects from CoQ10 is not very clear, and more research is needed.

**Quality of Evidence:**
The evidence ranged from moderate to very low quality because of limited study sizes and potential biases.

**Conclusion:**
While CoQ10 shows promise in reducing deaths and hospital visits, the results are not strong enough to make firm recommendations. More research is needed to be sure about its effects and safety for heart health. 

**Next Steps:**
Future studies are needed to confirm these findings and provide clearer guidance on using CoQ10 for heart failure."
"Background
Development of cancer of the cervix is a multi‐step process as before cervical cancer develops, cervical cells undergo changes and become abnormal. These abnormalities are called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and are associated with increased risk of subsequent invasive cancer of the cervix. Oncogenic high‐risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV), the causative agent of cervical cancer and its precursor lesions, is present in up to one‐third of women following large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) treatment and is associated with increased risk of residual disease and disease recurrence. HPV testing may serve as a surveillance tool for identifying women at higher risk of recurrence. High‐risk human papillomavirus testing will enable us to identify women at increased risk of residual or recurrent CIN and therefore will allow us to offer closer surveillance and early treatment, when indicated. 
Objectives
• To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of hrHPV testing after large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) treatment • To determine optimal follow‐up management strategies following LLETZ treatment according to hrHPV status 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynacological Cancer Review Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed and PsycINFO up to August 2013. We searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of included studies, and we contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We searched for randomised control trials (RCTs) that compared follow‐up management strategies following LLETZ treatment for CIN. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria. No trials were found; therefore no data were analysed. 
Main results
The search identified 813 references on MEDLINE, 418 on EMBASE, 22 on CINAHL, 666 on PubMed, 291 on PsycINFO and 145 on CENTRAL. When all references were imported into EndNote and duplications were removed, 1348 references remained. Initial screening of titles and abstracts of these references revealed that 42 references were potentially eligible for this review. After reading the full‐text versions, we identified no relevant trials comparing hrHPV and cytology testing versus cytology testing alone for detecting residual or recurrent disease during follow‐up to LLETZ treatment of adult women with CIN. 
We found no evidence on the effects of hrHPV and cytology testing on residual or recurrent CIN2 or higher lesions, anxiety and psychosexual morbidity outcomes in women undergoing colposcopy and treatment for CIN. 
Authors' conclusions
We found no evidence from RCTs to inform decisions about the best surveillance strategy for women following treatment for CIN. A prognostic systematic review is needed to investigate the risk of developing recurrent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2+ (CIN2+) in women with a positive hrHPV test after large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) treatment.","Follow‐up strategies for women following treatment for CIN: Impact of HPV testing
Background 
It is widely accepted that infection with high‐risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) is associated with development of precancerous changes, namely, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer. It is also accepted that women who develop high‐grade CIN and subsequently receive treatment with a procedure called large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ), which uses a wire loop to remove abnormal cells, are at greater risk for developing further CIN than women who have never had CIN. Therefore, these women need regular follow‐up assessment to detect additional abnormalities. 
Main findings 
We searched for randomised control trials (RCTs) that compared follow‐up management strategies following LLETZ treatment for CIN. We checked 1348 titles and abstracts of potentially relevant references, but we identified no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that met our inclusion criteria. We identified trials of interest, but they were deemed not relevant because of their focus on diagnostic outcomes and examination of how sensitive tests are, rather than on the effects of different follow‐up strategies on long‐term outcomes. Currently no evidence indicates whether hrHPV post‐treatment testing is better or worse in terms of important long‐term clinical outcomes. This review highlights the need for good quality trials in this area that do not focus solely on the diagnostic accuracy of testing. 
Conclusion 
We found no evidence from RCTs to inform decisions about the best surveillance strategy following treatment for CIN. A prognostic systematic review is needed to investigate the risks and benefits of different follow‐up strategies for women after LLETZ treatment.","# Plain Language Summary

## What is this study about?

This study looked for research comparing different ways to check on women after they have a specific treatment for cervical cell changes.

## Background: Why does this matter?

Before cervical cancer develops, cells in the cervix can become abnormal. A virus called HPV causes these changes. After women receive a common treatment called LLETZ to remove abnormal cells, doctors need to watch them carefully to make sure the abnormal cells don't come back. 

Scientists think testing for HPV might help doctors figure out which women need closer check-ups after treatment.

## What did researchers want to find out?

The researchers wanted to:
- See if HPV testing after LLETZ treatment works well and is safe
- Learn the best way to follow up with patients based on their HPV test results

## What did they do?

The researchers searched through thousands of medical studies published up to August 2013 to find research comparing different follow-up plans after LLETZ treatment.

## What did they find?

**They found no studies that compared these different follow-up methods.**

The researchers looked through 1,348 different references but found that no research studies had tested whether HPV testing plus regular cell checks was better than regular cell checks alone for catching cell changes that come back.

## What does this mean?

There is no solid research evidence yet to tell doctors the best way to watch women after LLETZ treatment. More research is needed to understand which women are at higher risk for cell changes returning.","### Study Overview

**Purpose:**  
This study looked at testing for a virus called high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) in women who had a treatment called LLETZ due to changes in cervical cells. The goal was to see if testing could help monitor women for any problems after treatment.

**Who Was Involved:**  
The study aimed to include women who had undergone LLETZ treatment for abnormal cervical cells.

**What Was Tested:**  
The focus was on hrHPV testing to see if it could catch any leftover or returning issues after LLETZ treatment.

**Study Activities:**  
Researchers searched for existing studies that compared hrHPV testing with regular methods. They looked into databases and talked to experts to find relevant studies.

**Results:**  
Despite looking through a large number of references, no suitable studies were found that compared hrHPV testing with other methods after LLETZ treatment.

**Conclusions:**  
There isn’t enough evidence to suggest the best way to monitor women after LLETZ treatment. More research is needed to understand how testing for hrHPV might predict ongoing issues with cervical cells.

**What’s Next:**  
A new review focusing on women with positive hrHPV tests after LLETZ treatment is suggested to better assess risks."
"Background
Intramedullary nailing is commonly used for treating fractures of the tibial shaft. These fractures are one of the most common long bone fractures in adults. 
Objectives
To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of different methods and types of intramedullary nailing for treating tibial shaft fractures in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and reference lists of articles to December 2009. The search was subsequently updated to September 2011 to assess the more recent literature. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled clinical studies evaluating different methods and types of intramedullary nailing for treating tibial shaft fractures in adults were included. Primary outcomes were health‐related quality of life, patient‐reported function and re‐operation for treatment failure or complications. 
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment, and data collection and extraction. 
Main results
Nine randomised and two quasi‐randomised clinical trials, involving a total of 2093 participants with 2123 fractures, were included. The evidence was dominated by one large multicentre trial of 1319 participants. Both quasi‐randomised trials were at high risk of selection bias. Otherwise, the trials were generally at low or unclear risk of bias. There were very few data on functional outcomes; and often incomplete data on re‐operations. The trials evaluated five different comparisons of interventions: reamed versus unreamed intramedullary nailing (six trials); Ender nail versus interlocking nail (two trials); expandable nail versus interlocking nail (one trial); interlocking nail with one distal screw versus with two distal screws (one trial); and closed nailing via the transtendinous approach versus the paratendinous approach (one trial). 
No statistically significant differences were found between the reamed and unreamed nailing groups in 'major' re‐operations (66/789 versus 72/756; risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.21; 5 trials), or in the secondary outcomes of nonunion, pain, deep infection, malunion and compartment syndrome. While inconclusive, the evidence from a subgroup analysis suggests that reamed nailing is more likely to reduce the incidence of major re‐operations related to non‐union in closed fractures than in open fractures. Implant failure, such as broken screws, occurred less often in the reamed nailing group (35/789 versus 79/756; RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.61). 
There was insufficient evidence established to determine the effects of interlocking nail with one distal screw versus with two distal screws, interlocking nail versus expandable nail and paratendinous approach versus transtendinous approach for treating tibial shaft fractures in adults. 
Ender nails when compared with an interlocking nail in two trials resulted in a higher re‐operation rate (12/110 versus 3/128; RR 4.43, 95% CI 1.37 to 14.32) and more malunions. There were no statistically significant differences between the two devices in the other reported secondary outcomes of nonunion, deep infection, and implant failure. 
One trial found a lower re‐operation rate for an expandable nail when compared with an interlocking nail (1/27 versus 9/26; RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.79). The differences between the two nails in the incidence of deep infection or neurological defects were not statistically significant. 
The trial comparing one distal screw versus two distal screws found no statistically significant difference in nonunion between the two groups. However, it found significantly more implant failures in the one distal screw group (13/22 versus 1/20; RR 11.82, 95% CI 1.70 to 82.38). 
One trial found no statistically significant differences in functional outcomes or anterior knee pain at three year follow‐up between the transtendinous approach and the paratendinous approach for nail insertion. 
Authors' conclusions
Overall, there is insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions on the best type of, or technique for, intramedullary nailing for tibial shaft fractures in adults. 'Moderate' quality evidence suggests that there is no clear difference in the rate of major re‐operations and complications between reamed and unreamed intramedullary nailing. Reamed intramedullary nailing has, however, a lower incidence of implant failure than unreamed nailing. 'Low' quality evidence suggests that reamed nailing may reduce the incidence of major re‐operations related to non‐union in closed fractures rather than in open fractures. 'Low' quality evidence suggests that the Ender nail has poorer results in terms of re‐operation and malunion than an interlocking nail.","Intramedullary nailing treat tibial shaft fractures in adults
Fractures of the tibial shaft (breaks in the bone situated in the long middle section of the tibia or shin bone) are mostly caused by high‐energy trauma, such as motor vehicle accidents. One commonly used method of fixation is intramedullary nailing. This involves the insertion of a metal rod, usually from the upper side of the tibia, into the inner cavity (medulla) of the tibia. The rod is generally held in place by screws. An available and widely used surgical technique of intramedullary nailing is inserting intramedullary nails with reaming (the bone cavity is reamed, before inserting the nail into the bone cavity space) or without reaming. This review looked at the evidence from trials comparing various types of intramedullary nailing. 
Eleven studies involving a total of 2093 participants were included. The evidence was dominated by one large multicentre trial of 1319 participants. The methods of two studies were flawed such that their results were likely to be biased. The remaining studies were at a lower risk of bias. The trials evaluated five different comparisons of interventions. Only the two comparisons tested by more than one trial are reported here. These were reamed versus unreamed intramedullary nailing (six trials) and Ender nail versus interlocking nail (two trials). The review found no evidence of a significant difference between reamed and unreamed intramedullary nailing in re‐operations for complications, nor in various complications such as nonunion (where the bone fails to heal). However, reamed nailing was more associated with a lower implant failure, such as broken screws, than unreamed nailing. Moreover, there was some weak evidence that reamed nailing may be associated with fewer major re‐operations for non‐union when used for closed fractures (where the skin remains intact) compared with open (where the skin is broken) fractures. The review also found that the Ender nail resulted in more re‐operations and deformity (malunion) than an interlocking nail. The review concluded that there is insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions on the best type of, or technique for, intramedullary nailing for tibial shaft fractures in adults.","# Plain Language Summary: Intramedullary Nailing for Shin Bone Fractures

## What is this study about?

This review looked at different surgical methods for fixing broken shin bones (tibia) in adults using metal rods inserted through the center of the bone. Researchers wanted to find out which methods work best and cause the fewest problems.

## Who was studied?

The review included 11 studies with a total of 2,093 adults who had shin bone fractures. Most participants were in one large study with 1,319 people.

## What treatments were compared?

Researchers compared five different ways of inserting and designing these metal rods:
- Rods that were reamed (enlarged the bone channel first) versus not reamed
- Different types of rod designs (Ender nails, expandable nails, and interlocking nails)
- Rods with one screw versus two screws at the bottom
- Different surgical approaches to insert the rod

## What were the main findings?

**Reamed vs. Unreamed Rods:** Both methods had similar rates of needing another surgery. However, reamed rods had fewer broken screws.

**Different Rod Types:** Ender nails required more follow-up surgeries and had more bone alignment problems compared to interlocking nails. One study found expandable nails needed fewer repeat surgeries than interlocking nails.

**One Screw vs. Two Screws:** Rods with one screw had more screw failures than rods with two screws.

**Surgical Approaches:** Two different ways of inserting the rod showed similar results.

## Bottom line

There isn't enough strong evidence to say one method is clearly better than all others. Reamed rods may be slightly better because they have fewer broken screws, but more research is needed.","### Plain Language Summary

**What is Being Studied?**
This study looks at different ways to fix broken shinbones (the big bones in your lower legs) in adults using a method called intramedullary nailing.

**Why is This Important?**
Tibial shaft fractures, or breaks in the shinbone, are common in adults. Doctors use metal rods called nails to hold the bone in place while it heals. This study checks how different types of nails work and if they have any benefits or risks.

**Who Was Involved?**
The study reviewed data from 11 smaller studies with a total of 2,093 adults who had 2,123 fractures.

**What Did They Do?**
The studies looked at different ways to use these nails:
- Reamed vs. unreamed nails
- Different types like Ender and interlocking nails
- Different nail placement methods

**What Were They Checking?**
They wanted to see how well people healed and if they needed more surgery. They also looked for problems like pain, infection, or broken nails.

**Key Findings:**

- **Reamed vs. Unreamed Nails**: No big differences in surgery needs or complications, but reamed nails had fewer broken nails.
- **Ender vs. Interlocking Nails**: Ender nails needed more surgeries and had more healing problems.
- **Expandable vs. Interlocking Nails**: Fewer surgeries were needed with expandable nails, but no other big differences.
- **One vs. Two Screws**: Using one screw led to more broken nails than using two.
- **Different Placement Methods**: No important differences in healing or pain after surgery.

**Conclusion**
There isn’t enough proof to say which type of nail or method is the best for fixing these fractures. But reamed nails seem to have fewer issues with broken pieces.

**Safety**
The study made sure to look for risks and benefits, but some data was unclear or incomplete. This means there is still a lot to learn about the best way to treat these fractures."
"Background
High intake of added sugar have been suggested to impact the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Knowledge on the subject can contribute to preventing CVD. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of a high versus low‐added sugar consumption for primary prevention of CVD in the general population. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (CPCI‐S) on 2 July 2021. We also conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal for ongoing or unpublished trials. The search was performed together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We imposed no restriction on language of publication or publication status. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over trials, that compared different levels of added sugar intake. Exclusion criteria were: participants aged below 18 years; diabetes mellitus (type 1 and 2); and previous CVD. Primary outcomes were incident cardiovascular events (coronary, carotid, cerebral and peripheral arterial disease) and all‐cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL‐cholesterol, HDL‐cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose and adverse events (gastrointestinal symptoms and impaired dental health). 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 21 RCTs (1110 participants completing the interventions) examining the effects of different levels of added sugar intake with a mean duration of 14 weeks. The study participants were generally described as healthy and the mean age ranged from 22 to 57 years. 
No studies reported on cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality. There was minimal effect of low intake of added sugar on total cholesterol levels (MD 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.21; I² = 0%; 16 studies; 763 participants; low certainty of evidence) and triglycerides (MD 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17; I² = 3%; 14 studies; 725 participants) but no evidence of effect on LDL‐cholesterol and HDL‐cholesterol. There was minimal effect on diastolic blood pressure (MD 1.52, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.37; I² = 0%; 13 studies; 873 participants) and on systolic blood pressure (MD 1.44, 95% 0.08 to 2.80; I² = 27%, 14 studies; 873 participants; low certainty of evidence), but no evidence of effect on fasting plasma glucose. 
Only one study reported on dental health, with no events. No other trials reported adverse events (impaired dental health or gastrointestinal symptoms). 
All results were judged as low‐quality evidence according to GRADE. The risk of bias was generally unclear, five studies were classified at an overall low risk of bias (low risk in at least four domains, not including other bias). 
Authors' conclusions
No trials investigating the effect of added sugar on cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality were identified in our searches. Evidence is uncertain whether low intake of added sugar has an effect on risk factors for CVD; the effect was small and the clinical relevance is, therefore, uncertain. Practical ways to achieve reductions in dietary added sugar includes following current dietary recommendations. 
Future trials should have longer follow‐up time and report on all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular events in order to clarify the effect of added sugar on these outcomes. Future trials should also aim for more direct interventions and preferably be more independent of industry funding.","Low levels of sugar to prevent cardiovascular disease
Background 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a group of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels and the number one cause of death worldwide. It is important to detect modifiable risk factors and find strategies to prevent CVD. There are several established modifiable risk factors for developing CVD, one of them being eating an unhealthy diet rich in sugar. Sugar can be divided in two categories; sugars naturally occurring in food and sugars that are added to food. A high level of added sugar intake is suggested to cause weight gain and affect blood lipids, increasing the risk of CVD. This review assessed different levels of added sugars in the diet and the effect on cardiovascular events (e.g. heart attack or stroke), death, and CVD risk factors in healthy adults. 
Study characteristics 
Databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials in which participants are randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control treatment) were searched. The trials that were included compared different levels of added sugar intake and its effect on risk factors for CVD in healthy adults. People with previous CVD or diabetes were not included in the review. 
Key results 
Twenty‐one trials were found with 1110 participants. None of the trials looked at cardiovascular events or death. The trials reported on blood pressure, blood lipid levels and blood sugar levels. The review found that low levels of added sugar intake led to a small reduction in blood pressure and blood lipid levels, but no effect was seen on blood sugar. The evidence is current to July 2021. 
Quality of the evidence 
The studies included in the review provide low‐quality evidence that low levels of added sugar in the diet indirectly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. More long‐term studies of high quality assessing effects of different levels of sugar on CVD risk factors, cardiovascular events and death are needed.","# Plain Language Summary: Added Sugar and Heart Disease

## What is this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if eating less added sugar helps prevent heart disease in healthy adults. They looked at 21 different studies that compared people who ate high amounts of added sugar with people who ate low amounts.

## Who was in the studies?

The studies included 1,110 healthy adults, mostly between ages 22 and 57. The studies lasted an average of 14 weeks.

## What did researchers measure?

Researchers looked at:
- **Main goals:** Whether people had heart attacks or strokes, or died
- **Secondary goals:** Blood pressure, cholesterol levels, blood sugar, and any side effects like stomach problems or tooth damage

## What did they find?

**The big picture:** No studies actually measured whether eating less sugar prevented heart attacks or strokes—that's an important gap.

**What they did measure:**
- Eating less added sugar had **very small effects** on cholesterol and triglycerides (a type of fat in blood)
- There were **tiny decreases** in blood pressure
- There was **no clear effect** on blood sugar levels
- Only one study looked at tooth health, and it found no problems

## What does this mean?

The researchers concluded that we don't have strong evidence yet that eating less added sugar prevents heart disease. The small changes they found were so tiny that we don't know if they really matter for people's health.

## What's next?

Researchers need longer studies that actually track whether people have heart attacks or strokes when they eat less sugar.","**Plain-Language Summary**

**Purpose of the Study**
This study looks at how eating a lot of added sugar versus a little affects heart health.

**Who Participated?**
The study included adults age 18 and up who were generally healthy. People with diabetes or past heart problems were not included.

**What Was Done?**
The study reviewed 21 experiments with 1,110 people. They were asked to eat different amounts of added sugar for about 14 weeks.

**What Was Measured?**
Researchers checked if eating less added sugar affected:
- Heart events (like heart attacks)
- Blood pressure
- Cholesterol levels
- Blood sugar
- Dental health

**Key Findings**
- No heart events or deaths were reported.
- Eating less sugar had a tiny effect on some things like total cholesterol and blood pressure, but the changes were not strong or clear.
- There were no big changes in blood sugar or bad cholesterol.
- Only one study looked at dental health and found no problems.
- The results are based on low-quality evidence, meaning we're not very sure about them.

**Safety**
No serious side effects like stomach problems or tooth issues were reported.

**Conclusions**
We don't have strong proof that eating less added sugar helps prevent heart problems. More studies are needed to find out for sure, and they should look more closely at actual heart events over a longer time. Following health guidelines on sugar is a good start for now."
"Background
Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common emergency involving the gastrointestinal tract occurring in the neonatal period. There have been published reports that suggest that oral immunoglobulins (Ig)A and IgG produce an immunoprotective effect in the gastrointestinal mucosa. 
Objectives
To determine the effect of oral immunoglobulin on the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and other complications in preterm or low birth weight (or both) neonates. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Group. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 1), PubMed (1966 to January 2016), CINAHL (1982 to January 2016) and EMBASE (1980 to January 2016) and conference proceedings. 
Selection criteria
All randomized or quasi‐randomised controlled trials where oral immunoglobulins were used as prophylaxis against NEC in preterm (less than 37 weeks' gestation) or low birth weight (less than 2500 gram), or both, neonates. 
Data collection and analysis
We performed data collection and analysis in accordance with the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. 
Main results
The search identified five studies on oral immunoglobulin for the prevention of NEC of which three met the inclusion criteria. In this review of the three eligible trials (including 2095 neonates), the oral administration of IgG or an IgG/IgA combination did not result in a significant reduction in the incidence of definite NEC (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.25; typical risk difference (RD) ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.01; 3 studies, 1840 infants), suspected NEC (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.46; RD ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.01; 1 study, 1529 infants), need for surgery (typical RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.75; typical RD ‐0.03, 95% CI ‐0.06 to 0.00; 2 studies, 311 infants) or death from NEC (typical RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.59; typical RD 0.00, 95% CI ‐0.01 to 0.01; 3 studies, 1840 infants). 
Authors' conclusions
Based on the available trials, the evidence does not support the administration of oral immunoglobulin for the prevention of NEC. There are no randomized controlled trials of oral IgA alone for the prevention of NEC.","Oral immunoglobulin for preventing necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm and low birth weight neonates 
Review question: Does the use of oral immunoglobulin reduce the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and other complications in preterm or low birth weight (or both) neonates? 
Background: Immunoglobulin given orally for preventing emergency intestinal problems (necrotizing enterocolitis) in premature and low birth weight newborn infants. Destructive inflammation of the intestine (called necrotizing enterocolitis, NEC) is caused by gas‐producing bacteria that ferment milk. It is a potential problem for newborn preterm (born before their due date) and low birth weight (born at less than 2500 grams) infants. Even after leaving hospital, affected infants may need frequent and prolonged hospitalisation because of continuing nutritional problems. This makes it difficult for parents both emotionally and financially. Immunoglobulins are proteins found in the blood that give the body immunity to disease. Immunoglobulins (types IgA and IgG) taken by mouth (orally) may protect susceptible infants from developing NEC. 
Study characteristics: We searched the medical literature through January 2016 and found three randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) (with 2095 newborn infants). Treatment was started either in the first 24 hours following birth (two small studies) or following commencement of oral feeding (enteral) (one large well‐controlled study). In this large study, infants generally received breast milk, whereas they received formula milk in the other two studies. 
Results: Giving immunoglobulin (IgG alone or IgG plus IgA combination) did not reduce the incidence of NEC, need for surgery related to NEC or death from NEC, either during or after the study period. Immunoglobulins could possibly cause breakdown of red blood cells (called haemolysis) (red blood cells are common cells in the blood that delivery oxygen to organs), but no clinically important haemolysis was apparent. There were no other reported side effects. 
Quality of the evidence: There was low‐very low evidence for all the major outcomes. The major factor that affected the quality of evidence was the lack of precision in the result estimates, as the calculated plausible range of the effects (the 95% confidence intervals) were wide.","# Plain Language Summary: Oral Immunoglobulin for Preventing Bowel Problems in Premature Babies

## What is this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if giving babies a special protein by mouth could prevent a serious bowel problem that sometimes affects premature or small newborns.

## The Problem

Some premature and low birth weight babies develop a serious condition affecting their intestines (bowels). Scientists thought that giving babies certain protective proteins by mouth might help prevent this problem.

## What the researchers did

The researchers looked for all studies that tested whether giving babies these protective proteins by mouth could prevent the bowel problem. They found 3 good-quality studies that included 2,095 babies total.

## What they tested

Babies in the studies received either:
- Special protective proteins by mouth, OR
- Regular care (no special proteins)

Researchers then tracked whether babies developed the bowel problem and other health issues.

## What they found

**The protective proteins did NOT help prevent the bowel problem.** The babies who received the proteins had about the same rate of bowel problems as babies who didn't receive them. There were also no differences in:
- Babies needing surgery
- Babies who died from the bowel problem

## Conclusion

Based on these studies, giving premature babies these protective proteins by mouth does not appear to prevent the bowel problem doctors were trying to prevent.","### Plain Language Summary

**What Was Studied?**  
Researchers wanted to find out if giving certain medicines called oral immunoglobulins (IgA and IgG) could help prevent a serious bowel problem in newborns called necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). This study focused on babies who are born too early (before 37 weeks) or are very small (weighing less than 2500 grams). 

**How Was the Study Done?**  
Scientists looked at research from several big medical databases and conferences to find studies on this topic. They found five studies about using oral immunoglobulins to prevent this bowel problem.

**What Did the Study Find?**  
In the end, only three studies fit what the scientists were looking for, and these involved 2095 babies. The studies showed that giving oral immunoglobulin didn’t make a big difference in preventing NEC, needing surgery, or reducing deaths related to NEC.

**What Do These Results Mean?**  
The results suggest that oral immunoglobulin medicines do not significantly help in preventing this bowel problem in early or small newborns. Also, no studies looked at using IgA alone.

**Is It Safe?**  
The study didn’t show any particular safety issues, but the medicines didn’t help as hoped.

**Conclusion**  
Oral immunoglobulins might not be useful for preventing NEC in early or low birth weight babies based on current research. More studies might be needed to explore other options."
"Background
Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions are frequently implemented to reduce infectious diseases, and may be linked to improved nutrition outcomes in children. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effect of interventions to improve water quality and supply (adequate quantity to maintain hygiene practices), provide adequate sanitation and promote handwashing with soap, on the nutritional status of children under the age of 18 years and to identify current research gaps. 
Search methods
We searched 10 English‐language (including MEDLINE and CENTRAL) and three Chinese‐language databases for published studies in June 2012. We searched grey literature databases, conference proceedings and websites, reviewed reference lists and contacted experts and authors. 
Selection criteria
Randomised (including cluster‐randomised), quasi‐randomised and non‐randomised controlled trials, controlled cohort or cross‐sectional studies and historically controlled studies, comparing WASH interventions among children aged under 18 years. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently sought and extracted data on childhood anthropometry, biochemical measures of micronutrient status, and adherence, attrition and costs either from published reports or through contact with study investigators. We calculated mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We conducted study‐level and individual‐level meta‐analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect for randomised controlled trials only. 
Main results
Fourteen studies (five cluster‐randomised controlled trials and nine non‐randomised studies with comparison groups) from 10 low‐ and middle‐income countries including 22,241 children at baseline and nutrition outcome data for 9,469 children provided relevant information. Study duration ranged from 6 to 60 months and all studies included children under five years of age at the time of the intervention. Studies included WASH interventions either singly or in combination. Measures of child anthropometry were collected in all 14 studies, and nine studies reported at least one of the following anthropometric indices: weight‐for‐height, weight‐for‐age or height‐for‐age. None of the included studies were of high methodological quality as none of the studies masked the nature of the intervention from participants. 
Weight‐for‐age, weight‐for‐height and height‐for‐age z‐scores were available for five cluster‐randomised controlled trials with a duration of between 9 and 12 months. Meta‐analysis including 4,627 children identified no evidence of an effect of WASH interventions on weight‐for‐age z‐score (MD 0.05; 95% CI ‐0.01 to 0.12). Meta‐analysis including 4,622 children identified no evidence of an effect of WASH interventions on weight‐for‐height z‐score (MD 0.02; 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.11). Meta‐analysis including 4,627 children identified a borderline statistically significant effect of WASH interventions on height‐for‐age z‐score (MD 0.08; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.16). These findings were supported by individual participant data analysis including information on 5,375 to 5,386 children from five cluster‐randomised controlled trials. 
No study reported adverse events. Adherence to study interventions was reported in only two studies (both cluster‐randomised controlled trials) and ranged from low (< 35%) to high (> 90%). Study attrition was reported in seven studies and ranged from 4% to 16.5%. Intervention cost was reported in one study in which the total cost of the WASH interventions was USD 15/inhabitant. None of the studies reported differential impacts relevant to equity issues such as gender, socioeconomic status and religion. 
Authors' conclusions
The available evidence from meta‐analysis of data from cluster‐randomised controlled trials with an intervention period of 9‐12 months is suggestive of a small benefit of WASH interventions (specifically solar disinfection of water, provision of soap, and improvement of water quality) on length growth in children under five years of age. The duration of the intervention studies was relatively short and none of the included studies is of high methodological quality. Very few studies provided information on intervention adherence, attrition and costs. There are several ongoing trials in low‐income country settings that may provide robust evidence to inform these findings.","The effect of interventions to improve water quality and supply, provide sanitation and promote handwashing with soap on physical growth in children 
In low‐income countries an estimated 165 million children under the age of five years suffer from chronic undernutrition causing them to be short in height and 52 million children suffer from acute undernutrition causing them to be very thin. Poor growth in early life increases the risks of illness and death in childhood. The two immediate causes of childhood undernutrition are inadequate dietary intake and infectious diseases such as diarrhoea. Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions are frequently implemented to reduce infectious diseases; this review evaluates the effect that WASH interventions may have on nutrition outcomes in children. The review includes evidence from randomised and non‐randomised interventions designed to (i) improve the microbiological quality of drinking water or protect the microbiological quality of water prior to consumption; (ii) introduce new or improved water supply or improve distribution; (iii) introduce or expand the coverage and use of facilities designed to improve sanitation; or (iv) promote handwashing with soap after defecation and disposal of child faeces, and prior to preparing and handling food, or a combination of these interventions, in children aged under 18 years. 
We identified 14 studies of such interventions involving 22,241 children at baseline and nutrition outcome data for 9,469 children. Meta‐analyses of the evidence from the cluster‐randomised trials suggests that WASH interventions confer a small benefit on growth in children under five years of age. While potentially important, this conclusion is based on relatively short‐term studies, none of which is of high methodological quality, and should therefore be treated with caution. There are several large, robust studies underway in low‐income country settings that should provide evidence to inform these findings.","# Plain Language Summary: Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Programs and Child Growth

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether programs that improve water, sanitation, and handwashing help children grow better and be healthier. Researchers searched for studies that tested these programs in children under 18 years old.

## Why does this matter?

Clean water, working toilets, and handwashing with soap help prevent diseases. Scientists wanted to know if these programs also help children grow taller and gain weight properly.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at 14 studies from 10 low- and middle-income countries. These studies included about 22,000 children at the start. The programs lasted between 6 and 60 months (about 6 months to 5 years). All studies looked at children under age 5.

The programs tested different combinations of:
- Better water quality and supply
- Improved toilets and sanitation
- Handwashing with soap

## What did they find?

**Main results:**
- Programs did **not** clearly help children gain weight
- Programs did **not** clearly help children's weight compared to their height
- Programs showed a **small possible benefit** for children's height growth

The studies lasted 9–12 months on average. About 4,600–4,600 children were studied for each measurement.

## What else did researchers learn?

- **Safety:** No studies reported harmful side effects
- **Cost:** One study reported programs cost about $15 per person
- **Follow-up:** Between 4% and 16.5% of children dropped out of studies
- **Fairness:** No studies looked at whether programs helped boys and girls equally or rich and poor families equally

## Limitations

- Studies were not high quality (participants knew they were in a program)
- Most studies were short (9–12 months)
- Few studies reported how well people followed the programs or how much they cost

## Bottom line

Water, sanitation, and handwashing programs may help children grow taller, but the benefit is small. More research is needed to understand the full impact.","### Plain Language Summary

#### What Was the Study About?
This study looked at how improving water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) might help children's growth and nutrition. Researchers wanted to see if cleaning up water, providing soap, and other similar actions could make a difference for kids under 18, especially those under five years old.

#### How Did They Do the Study?
Researchers searched for different studies around the world that involved kids under 18. They looked at studies where kids were part of groups compared with each other and studies with historical data.

#### What Did They Find?
They found 14 studies involving more than 22,000 kids from 10 different countries. Most of these kids were under five years old. The studies lasted from 6 months to 5 years. They checked things like kids’ weight and height to see if the WASH programs made a difference.

#### What Were the Results?
- They didn’t find strong proof that these interventions changed kids' weight or height in most cases.
- However, there was a small sign that the programs might help children grow taller.

#### Did Anything Go Wrong?
- No study reported any harmful effects from the WASH programs.
- Following the WASH program rules was reported in only a couple of studies, and it varied a lot.

#### How Much Did It Cost?
Only one study reported costs: the WASH programs cost about $15 per person.

#### Conclusions
The researchers thought that WASH programs might help children's height a little, but more long-term and high-quality studies are needed. More studies are being done in other countries, which might give clearer answers in the future."
"Background
Child overweight and obesity has increased globally, and can be associated with short‐ and long‐term health consequences. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obesity in preschool children up to the age of 6 years. 
Search methods
We performed a systematic literature search in the databases Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and LILACS, as well as in the trial registers ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP Search Portal. We also checked references of identified trials and systematic reviews. We applied no language restrictions. The date of the last search was March 2015 for all databases. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for treating overweight or obesity in preschool children aged 0 to 6 years. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias, evaluated the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE instrument, and extracted data following the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We contacted trial authors for additional information. 
Main results
We included 7 RCTs with a total of 923 participants: 529 randomised to an intervention and 394 to a comparator. The number of participants per trial ranged from 18 to 475. Six trials were parallel RCTs, and one was a cluster RCT. Two trials were three‐arm trials, each comparing two interventions with a control group. The interventions and comparators in the trials varied. We categorised the comparisons into two groups: multicomponent interventions and dietary interventions. The overall quality of the evidence was low or very low, and six trials had a high risk of bias on individual 'Risk of bias' criteria. The children in the included trials were followed up for between six months and three years. 
In trials comparing a multicomponent intervention with usual care, enhanced usual care, or information control, we found a greater reduction in body mass index (BMI) z score in the intervention groups at the end of the intervention (6 to 12 months): mean difference (MD) ‐0.3 units (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.4 to ‐0.2); P < 0.00001; 210 participants; 4 trials; low‐quality evidence, at 12 to 18 months' follow‐up: MD ‐0.4 units (95% CI ‐0.6 to ‐0.2); P = 0.0001; 202 participants; 4 trials; low‐quality evidence, and at 2 years' follow‐up: MD ‐0.3 units (95% CI ‐0.4 to ‐0.1); 96 participants; 1 trial; low‐quality evidence. 
One trial stated that no adverse events were reported; the other trials did not report on adverse events. Three trials reported health‐related quality of life and found improvements in some, but not all, aspects. Other outcomes, such as behaviour change and parent‐child relationship, were inconsistently measured. 
One three‐arm trial of very low‐quality evidence comparing two types of diet with control found that both the dairy‐rich diet (BMI z score change MD ‐0.1 units (95% CI ‐0.11 to ‐0.09); P < 0.0001; 59 participants) and energy‐restricted diet (BMI z score change MD ‐0.1 units (95% CI ‐0.11 to ‐0.09); P < 0.0001; 57 participants) resulted in greater reduction in BMI than the comparator at the end of the intervention period, but only the dairy‐rich diet maintained this at 36 months' follow‐up (BMI z score change in MD ‐0.7 units (95% CI ‐0.71 to ‐0.69); P < 0.0001; 52 participants). The energy‐restricted diet had a worse BMI outcome than control at this follow‐up (BMI z score change MD 0.1 units (95% CI 0.09 to 0.11); P < 0.0001; 47 participants). There was no substantial difference in mean daily energy expenditure between groups. Health‐related quality of life, adverse effects, participant views, and parenting were not measured. 
No trial reported on all‐cause mortality, morbidity, or socioeconomic effects.
All results should be interpreted cautiously due to their low quality and heterogeneous interventions and comparators. 
Authors' conclusions
Muticomponent interventions appear to be an effective treatment option for overweight or obese preschool children up to the age of 6 years. However, the current evidence is limited, and most trials had a high risk of bias. Most trials did not measure adverse events. We have identified four ongoing trials that we will include in future updates of this review. 
The role of dietary interventions is more equivocal, with one trial suggesting that dairy interventions may be effective in the longer term, but not energy‐restricted diets. This trial also had a high risk of bias.","Diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obesity in preschool children up to the age of 6 years 
Review question 
How effective are diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions in reducing the weight of overweight and obese preschool children? 
Background 
Across the world more children are becoming overweight and obese. These children are more likely to suffer from health problems, both while as children and in later life. More information is needed about what works best for treating this problem. 
Study characteristics 
We found 7 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing diet, physical activity, and behavioural (where habits are changed or improved) treatments (interventions) to a variety of control groups (who did not receive treatment) delivered to 923 overweight or obese preschool children up to the age of 6 years. We grouped the studies by the type of intervention. Our systematic review reported on the effects of multicomponent interventions and dietary interventions compared with no intervention, 'usual care', enhanced usual care, or some other therapy if it was also delivered in the intervention arm. The children in the included studies were monitored (called follow‐up) for between six months and three years. 
Key results 
Most studies reported the body mass index (BMI) z score: BMI is a measure of body fat and is calculated by dividing weight (in kilograms) by the square of the body height measured in metres (kg/m²). In children, BMI is often measured in a way that takes into account sex, weight, and height as children grow older (BMI z score). We summarised the results of 4 trials in 202 children reporting the BMI z score, which on average was 0.4 units lower in the multicomponent intervention groups compared with the control groups. Lower units indicate more weight loss. For example, a 5‐year‐old girl with a body height of 110 cm and a body weight of 32 kg has a BMI of 26.4 and a BMI z score of 2.99. If this girl loses 2 kg weight within a year (and gained 1 cm in height), she would have reduced her BMI z score by approx. 0.4 units (her BMI would be 24.3 and her BMI z score 2.58). Accordingly, the average change in weight in the multicomponent interventions was 2.8 kg lower than in the control groups. Other effects of the interventions, such as improvements in health‐related quality of life or evaluation of the parent‐child relationship, were less clear, and most studies did not measure adverse events. No study investigated death from any cause, morbidity, or socioeconomic effects. One study found that BMI z score reduction was greater at the end of both dairy‐rich and energy‐restricted dietary interventions compared with a healthy lifestyle education only. However, only the dairy‐rich diet continued to show benefits two to three years later, whereas the energy‐restricted diet group had a greater increase in BMI z score than the control group. 
This evidence is up to date as of March 2015.
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of the evidence was low or very low, mainly because there were just a few studies per outcome measurement or the number of the included children was small. In addition, many children left the studies before they had finished.","# Plain Language Summary: Treating Overweight in Young Children

## What is this study about?

This review looked at different ways to help young children (ages 0–6 years) who weigh more than is healthy. Researchers wanted to see if programs involving diet changes, more physical activity, and behavior changes could help these children.

## How did researchers do this?

Scientists searched medical databases for studies that tested these programs. They found 7 studies that tested different approaches with a total of 923 young children. Some children received a special program, while others received regular care or information only. The children were followed for 6 months to 3 years.

## What did they find?

**Programs with multiple parts worked best:**
- Programs that combined diet, activity, and behavior changes helped children more than regular care
- Children in these programs had better weight measurements at 6–12 months, 12–18 months, and 2 years
- Some children also showed improvements in quality of life

**Diet-only programs had mixed results:**
- One study tested two types of diets: one with more dairy and one with fewer calories
- The dairy-rich diet helped children keep weight down for 3 years
- The low-calorie diet did not work as well over time

## Important limitations

- The quality of the studies was low
- Most studies didn't report whether children had any side effects
- Researchers didn't measure some important things, like how programs affected family relationships or costs

## Bottom line

Programs that combine diet, activity, and behavior changes appear to help young children with weight concerns. However, more high-quality research is needed to be sure.","### Simple Summary of Study on Helping Young Children with Extra Weight

**Why is This Study Important?**
More kids around the world are becoming overweight, which isn't healthy. This study looked at ways to help preschool children, up to 6 years old, who are overweight.

**What Was the Study About?**
The study wanted to see if changing a child's diet, getting more exercise, and adjusting behaviors could help children lose extra weight.

**Who Was Involved?**
The study looked at information from seven different trials with 923 children. These trials involved kids who tried new things like eating differently and moving more.

**What Did They Do?**
The trials tested two main approaches:
1. **Multicomponent Interventions:** A mix of strategies including diet, physical activity, and behavior changes.
2. **Dietary Interventions:** Specific changes in what the children ate.

**How Long Did It Last?**
Children were followed from 6 months to 3 years.

**What Were the Findings?**
- **Multicomponent Interventions:** These seemed to help reduce weight over time (6-12 months, 12-18 months, and 2 years). However, the information we have isn't very strong.
- **Diet Changes:** One type of diet with lots of dairy helped some children in the long run, but another kind of diet (low-energy diet) was not as effective over time.

**Safety and Other Effects:**
- Only one trial said there were no bad effects reported. 
- Some trials noted improvements in how the kids felt about their health and life, but the data wasn’t very clear or consistent.

**Conclusion:**
Trying different ways to help young children manage their weight can be helpful, especially when using a mix of diet and exercise programs. However, because the findings are not very strong, more research is needed to confirm these results.

**Future Plans:**
There are four more studies in progress that might give us a clearer picture in the future."
"Background
Children who are securely attached to at least one parent are able to be comforted by that parent when they are distressed and explore the world confidently by using that parent as a 'secure base'. Research suggests that a secure attachment enables children to function better across all aspects of their development. Promoting secure attachment, therefore, is a goal of many early interventions. Attachment is mediated through parental sensitivity to signals of distress from the child. One means of improving parental sensitivity is through video feedback, which involves showing a parent brief moments of their interaction with their child, to strengthen their sensitivity and responsiveness to their child's signals. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of video feedback on parental sensitivity and attachment security in children aged under five years who are at risk for poor attachment outcomes. 
Search methods
In November 2018 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, nine other databases and two trials registers. We also handsearched the reference lists of included studies, relevant systematic reviews, and several relevant websites 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that assessed the effects of video feedback versus no treatment, inactive alternative intervention, or treatment as usual for parental sensitivity, parental reflective functioning, attachment security and adverse effects in children aged from birth to four years 11 months. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
This review includes 22 studies from seven countries in Europe and two countries in North America, with a total of 1889 randomised parent‐child dyads or family units. Interventions targeted parents of children aged under five years, experiencing a wide range of difficulties (such as deafness or prematurity), or facing challenges that put them at risk of attachment issues (for example, parental depression). Nearly all studies reported some form of external funding, from a charitable organisation (n = 7) or public body, or both (n = 18). 
We considered most studies as being at low or unclear risk of bias across the majority of domains, with the exception of blinding of participants and personnel, where we assessed all studies as being at high risk of performance bias. For outcomes where self‐report measures were used, such as parental stress and anxiety, we rated all studies at high risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessors. 
Parental sensitivity. A meta‐analysis of 20 studies (1757 parent‐child dyads) reported evidence of that video feedback improved parental sensitivity compared with a control or no intervention from postintervention to six months' follow‐up (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.49, moderate‐certainty evidence). The size of the observed impact compares favourably to other, similar interventions. 
Parental reflective functioning. No studies reported this outcome. 
Attachment security. A meta‐analysis of two studies (166 parent‐child dyads) indicated that video feedback increased the odds of being securely attached, measured using the Strange Situation Procedure, at postintervention (odds ratio 3.04, 95% CI 1.39 to 6.67, very low‐certainty evidence). A second meta‐analysis of two studies (131 parent‐child dyads) that assessed attachment security using a different measure (Attachment Q‐sort) found no effect of video feedback compared with the comparator groups (SMD 0.02, 95% CI −0.33 to 0.38, very low‐certainty evidence). 
Adverse events. Eight studies (537 parent‐child dyads) contributed data at postintervention or short‐term follow‐up to a meta‐analysis of parental stress, and two studies (311 parent‐child dyads) contributed short‐term follow‐up data to a meta‐analysis of parental anxiety. There was no difference between intervention and comparator groups for either outcome. For parental stress the SMD between video feedback and control was −0.09 (95% CI −0.26 to 0.09, low‐certainty evidence), while for parental anxiety the SMD was −0.28 (95% CI −0.87 to 0.31, very low‐certainty evidence). 
Child behaviour. A meta‐analysis of two studies (119 parent‐child dyads) at long‐term follow‐up found no evidence of the effectiveness of video feedback on child behaviour (SMD 0.04, 95% CI −0.33 to 0.42, very low‐certainty evidence). 
A moderator analysis found no evidence of an effect for the three prespecified variables (intervention type, number of feedback sessions and participating carer) when jointly tested. However, parent gender (both parents versus only mothers or only fathers) potentially has a statistically significant negative moderation effect, though only at α (alpha) = 0.1 
Authors' conclusions
There is moderate‐certainty evidence that video feedback may improve sensitivity in parents of children who are at risk for poor attachment outcomes due to a range of difficulties. There is currently only little, very low‐certainty evidence regarding the impact of video feedback on attachment security, compared with control: results differed based on the type of measure used, and follow‐up was limited in duration. There is no evidence that video feedback has an impact on parental stress or anxiety (low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence, respectively). Further evidence is needed regarding the longer‐term impact of video feedback on attachment and more distal outcomes such as children's behaviour (very low‐certainty evidence). Further research is needed on the impact of video‐feedback on paternal sensitivity and parental reflective functioning, as no study measured these outcomes. This review is limited by the fact that the majority of included parents were mothers.","Video feedback for parental sensitivity and child attachment
Background 
Children who are securely attached to at least one parent are able to be comforted by that parent when they are distressed and more able to explore the world confidently by using that parent as a 'secure base'. Research suggests that a secure attachment enables children to function better across all aspects of their development. Promoting secure attachment, therefore, is a goal of many programmes that aim to support children and families in the first few years of the child's life. Video feedback involves showing a parent brief moments of videotaped interaction between them and their baby, in order to strengthen their sensitivity to signals from their baby, with the aim of improving attachment. 
Review question 
To assess the effects of video feedback on parental sensitivity and attachment security in children under five years old who are at risk of poor outcomes, compared to no intervention (no treatment), a mock treatment (such as a phone call) or treatment as usual. 
Included studies 
This review included 22 studies, made up of 1889 randomised parent‐child pairs or family units. Not all of these could be combined in a meta‐analysis (a statistical method of combining data from several studies to reach a single, more robust conclusion). We combined data from 20 studies (made up of 1757 parent‐child pairs) to examine the effects of video feedback on parental sensitivity. We combined data from fewer studies to look at attachment security, parental stress, parental anxiety and child behaviour. 
The included studies were mostly conducted in Canada, the Netherlands, UK and USA. Single studies were conducted in Italy, Germany, Lithuania, Norway and Portugal. 
Almost all studies reported some form of external funding, from either a charitable organisation (n = 7) and/or public body (n = 18). 
Results 
The results show evidence of an improvement in parental sensitivity following the use of video feedback. The results for attachment security were mixed: one meta‐analysis showed that the intervention group were more securely attached, while the second meta‐analysis, which measured the strength of attachment in a different way, showed no evidence of impact. There was no evidence of impact on parental anxiety or stress. No studies measured parental reflective functioning. There was no evidence of impact on child behaviour. 
Study certainty 
We rated the overall certainty of the evidence (the extent to which we believe that the results are correct or adequate) as moderate for parental sensitivity, and low or very low for the other outcomes. This means that we are reasonably certain that video feedback improves parental sensitivity in the short term, but we are not very certain of its impact on our other findings. 
Authors' conclusions 
Video feedback may be a helpful method of improving parental sensitivity, but there is currently little or no evidence that it improves child attachment security, parental stress, parental anxiety or child behaviour. More research is needed on the effects of video feedback on other outcomes, including parental reflective functioning, and in fathers.","# Plain Language Summary: Video Feedback to Help Parents Connect with Young Children

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether showing parents videos of themselves with their young children helps parents become more sensitive and responsive to their children's needs. When children feel secure and supported by their parents, they can explore the world more confidently and do better in all areas of development.

## Who was studied?

The review included 22 studies from Europe and North America with a total of 1,889 families. The studies looked at parents of children under 5 years old who were at risk for attachment problems. These children had various challenges, such as being born early, being deaf, or having parents dealing with depression.

## What was tested?

Researchers compared two groups:
- **Video feedback group:** Parents watched short clips of themselves interacting with their child to help them become more aware of and responsive to their child's needs
- **Control group:** Parents received no treatment or standard care

## What were the main findings?

**How parents responded to their children:**
Video feedback helped parents become more sensitive and responsive to their children's signals and needs compared to the control group.

**Child attachment (feeling secure with parents):**
Results were mixed. One type of measurement showed video feedback helped children feel more secure, but another measurement showed no difference. The evidence was very weak.

**Parent stress and worry:**
Video feedback did not reduce parent stress or anxiety compared to the control group.

**Child behavior:**
There was no clear evidence that video feedback changed children's behavior over the long term.

## What does this mean?

There is moderate evidence that video feedback can help parents become more sensitive to their young children. However, more research is needed to understand if this leads to children feeling more secure long-term and to see if it works the same way for fathers as it does for mothers.","### Summary of the Study

**Objective**
The study looks at how showing parents video clips of their interactions with their young children can help improve the way they respond to their children's needs.

**Who Was Involved**
- Children under five years old who might have trouble developing a strong bond with their parents.
- Parents of these children, who might be facing challenges like stress or mental health issues.

**What They Did**
- Researchers reviewed 22 different studies involving 1889 pairs of parents and children or families.
- Parents in these studies either received video feedback, no treatment, or regular care.

**Key Findings**
1. **Parental Sensitivity**: 
   - Video feedback helped parents better understand and react to their kids’ needs. This improvement was noted from the end of the intervention up to six months later.

2. **Attachment Security**: 
   - Some studies showed increased odds of children having a secure attachment to their parents after video feedback, but results were uncertain and varied depending on the measurement method.

3. **Parental Stress and Anxiety**:
   - No significant changes were found in parents’ levels of stress or anxiety after receiving video feedback.

4. **Child Behavior**:
   - No long-term changes in children’s behavior were noted from video feedback.

**Safety and Side Effects**
- No major side effects were reported from using video feedback.

**Conclusions**
- Video feedback can likely help parents respond better to their kids, but its effect on building a secure bond between parents and kids needs more study.
- It’s unclear if video feedback affects parents' stress or anxiety levels.
- More research is needed, especially focusing on how video feedback affects fathers and its long-term effects on children’s behavior.

This research mainly involved mothers, so future studies should include more dads to see if results differ."
"Background
Older patients with multiple health problems (multi‐morbidity) value being involved in decision‐making about their health care. However, they are less frequently involved than younger patients. To maximise quality of life, day‐to‐day function, and patient safety, older patients require support to identify unmet healthcare needs and to prioritise treatment options. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of interventions for older patients with multi‐morbidity aiming to involve them in decision‐making about their health care during primary care consultations. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; all years to August 2018), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1966 to August 2018); Embase (OvidSP) (1988 to August 2018); PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1806 to August 2018); the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (Ovid) (1982 to September 2008), then in Ebsco (2009 to August 2018); Centre for Reviews and Dissemination Databases (Database of Abstracts and Reviews of Effects (DARE)) (all years to August 2018); the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database (all years to August 2018); the Ongoing Reviews Database (all years to August 2018); and Dissertation Abstracts International (1861 to August 2018). 
Selection criteria
We sought randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, and quasi‐RCTs of interventions to involve patients in decision‐making about their health care versus usual care/control/another intervention, for patients aged 65 years and older with multi‐morbidity in primary care. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Meta‐analysis was not possible; therefore we prepared a narrative synthesis. 
Main results
We included three studies involving 1879 participants: two RCTs and one cluster‐RCT. Interventions consisted of: 
· patient workshop and individual coaching using behaviour change techniques;
· individual patient coaching utilising cognitive‐behavioural therapy and motivational interviewing; and 
· holistic patient review, multi‐disciplinary practitioner training, and organisational change. 
No studies reported the primary outcome ‘patient involvement in decision‐making’ or the primary adverse outcome ‘less patient involvement as a result of the intervention’. 
Comparing interventions (patient workshop and individual coaching, holistic patient review plus practitioner training, and organisational change) to usual care: we are uncertain whether interventions had any effect on patient reports of high self‐rated health (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 5.49; very low‐certainty evidence) or on patient enablement (mean difference (MD) 0.60, 95% CI ‐9.23 to 10.43; very low‐certainty evidence) compared with usual care. Interventions probably had no effect on health‐related quality of life (adjusted difference in means 0.00, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.02; moderate‐certainty evidence) or on medication adherence (MD 0.06, 95% CI ‐0.05 to 0.17; moderate‐certainty evidence) but probably improved the number of patients discussing their priorities (adjusted odds ratio 1.85, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.38; moderate‐certainty evidence) and probably increased the number of nurse consultations (incident rate ratio from adjusted multi‐level Poisson model 1.37, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.61; moderate‐certainty evidence) compared with usual care. Practitioner outcomes were not measured. Interventions were not reported to adversely affect rates of participant death or anxiety, emergency department attendance, or hospital admission compared with usual care. 
Comparing interventions (patient workshop and coaching, individual patient coaching) to attention‐control conditions: we are uncertain whether interventions affect patient‐reported high self‐rated health (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.00, favouring attention control, with very low‐certainty evidence; RR 2.17, 95% CI 0.85 to 5.52, favouring the intervention, with very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether interventions affect patient enablement and engagement by increasing either patient activation (MD 1.20, 95% CI ‐8.21 to 10.61; very low‐certainty evidence) or self‐efficacy (MD 0.29, 95% CI ‐0.21 to 0.79; very low‐certainty evidence); or whether interventions affect the number of general practice visits (MD 0.51, 95% CI ‐0.34 to 1.36; very low‐certainty evidence), compared to attention‐control conditions. The intervention may however lead to more patient‐reported changes in management of their health conditions (RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.44; low‐certainty evidence). Practitioner outcomes were not measured. Interventions were not reported to adversely affect emergency department attendance nor hospital admission when compared with attention control. 
Comparing one form of intervention with another: not measured. 
There was 'unclear' risk across studies for performance bias, detection bias, and reporting bias; however, no aspects were 'high' risk. Evidence was downgraded via GRADE, most often because of 'small sample size' and 'evidence from a single study'. 
Authors' conclusions
Limited available evidence does not allow a robust conclusion regarding the objectives of this review. Whilst patient involvement in decision‐making is seen as a key mechanism for improving care, it is rarely examined as an intervention and was not measured by included studies. Consistency in design, analysis, and evaluation of interventions would enable a greater likelihood of robust conclusions in future reviews.","Interventions for involving older patients with more than one long‐term health problem in decision‐making during primary care consultations 
Background 
The number of older people with more than one long‐term health problem is steadily increasing worldwide. Such individuals can have complicated healthcare needs. Although they frequently want to be involved in making decisions about their health care, they are less often involved than younger, healthier people. As a result, they may not be offered the same treatment options. 
Review question 
We reviewed available evidence about the effects of interventions intended to involve older people with more than one long‐term health problem in decision‐making about their health care during primary care consultations. 
Study characteristics 
We included research published up until August 2018. We found three relevant studies involving 1879 participants. These studies were reported from three countries. Participants were over 65 years of age with three or more long‐term health problems on average. Interventions investigated included: 
· patient workshops and individual patient coaching;
· patient coaching including cognitive‐behavioural therapy; and
· whole‐person patient review, practitioner training, and organisational changes.
All studies were funded by national research bodies.
Key results 
None of the studies reported the main outcome ‘patient involvement in decision‐making about their health care’ nor whether there was less patient involvement as a result of the intervention. Interventions were not found to increase adverse outcomes such as death, anxiety, emergency department attendance, or hospital admissions.. 
We are uncertain whether interventions for involving older people with more than one long‐term health problem in decision‐making about their health care can improve their self‐rated health or healthcare engagement, or make any difference in self‐efficacy (one's belief in one's ability to succeed in specific situations) or in the overall number of general practice visits. We can report that these interventions probably make little or no difference in patients' quality of life but probably increase the number of patients discussing their priorities, and are associated with more patient consultations with nurses, when compared to usual care. Interventions may be associated with more changes in the management of health conditions when considered from the patient’s perspective when compared with a control group. 
The quality of the evidence was limited by small studies, and by studies choosing to measure different outcomes, resulting in lack of data that could be combined in analyses. 
Conclusions 
Further research in this developing area is required before firm conclusions can be drawn.","# Plain Language Summary: Helping Older Adults Make Health Care Decisions

## What is this study about?

Researchers wanted to learn whether special programs help older adults with multiple health problems take a bigger role in deciding about their own care when they visit their doctor.

## Why does this matter?

Older people with several health conditions often want to help make decisions about their health care, but doctors don't always ask them. Getting older adults more involved in these decisions might help them feel better and stay healthier.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked for studies that tested different programs designed to help older adults (age 65+) with multiple health problems be more involved in health care decisions at their doctor's office. They found 3 studies with almost 1,900 people total.

## What programs were tested?

The programs included:
- Workshops and one-on-one coaching to help people change their health habits
- Personal coaching using talking techniques to help people feel more confident
- Full health reviews by a team of doctors and nurses, plus training for staff

## What did they find?

**The good news:**
- People in these programs were more likely to talk about what matters most to them
- People had more visits with nurses
- The programs did not cause harm or increase hospital visits

**The uncertain news:**
- Researchers couldn't tell if the programs actually helped people feel more involved in decisions (this wasn't measured well)
- It's unclear if programs helped people feel healthier or more confident
- It's unclear if programs changed how much medicine people took

## Bottom line

There isn't enough strong evidence yet to say these programs definitely work. Researchers need better studies that clearly measure whether older adults actually feel more involved in making decisions about their care.","### Summary of Clinical Trial on Helping Older Patients Make Health Decisions

**Purpose of the Study**
The study looked at ways to help older patients with multiple health issues take part in decisions about their healthcare during regular doctor visits.

**Who Participated?**
The study included 1,879 older patients (65 years and older) with multiple health issues.

**What Was Tested?**
Three different types of interventions were tried:

1. Workshops and one-on-one coaching for patients using behavior change methods.
2. Coaching using cognitive-behavioral techniques and motivational talks.
3. A holistic review of patient health, training for healthcare teams, and changes in healthcare organizations.

**Goals and Measurements**
- The study aimed to see if these methods improved patient involvement in decisions, health quality, and medication use.
- It also looked at whether these methods increased discussions about health priorities and nurse consultations.

**Findings**
- The interventions seemed to boost how many patients discussed their health priorities and increased nurse consultations.
- There was no clear evidence that the methods improved the patients' perceived health quality or medication adherence.
- Some interventions might lead to better management of health conditions, but it's unclear if they greatly improved other health outcomes.
- No negative impacts such as increased emergency visits or hospital stays were reported.

**Limitations**
- The studies had unclear risks and small sample sizes, making it hard to draw firm conclusions.
- Important outcomes like patient involvement in decision-making weren't consistently measured.

**Conclusion**
While involving patients in decisions is important for their care, more research is needed to understand the best approaches to achieve this effectively. Future studies should be designed consistently to gather clearer results."
"Background
Ischaemia reperfusion injury can lead to kidney dysfunction or failure. Ischaemic preconditioning is a short period of deprivation of blood supply to particular organs or tissue, followed by a period of reperfusion. It has the potential to protect kidneys from ischaemia reperfusion injury. 
Objectives
This review aimed to look at the benefits and harms of local and remote ischaemic preconditioning to reduce ischaemia and reperfusion injury among people with renal ischaemia reperfusion injury. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 5 August 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials measuring kidney function and the role of ischaemic preconditioning in patients undergoing a surgical intervention that induces kidney injury. Kidney transplantation studies were excluded. 
Data collection and analysis
Studies were assessed for eligibility and quality; data were extracted by two independent authors. We collected basic study characteristics: type of surgery, remote ischaemic preconditioning protocol, type of anaesthesia. We collected primary outcome measurements: serum creatinine and adverse effects to remote ischaemic preconditioning and secondary outcome measurements: acute kidney injury, need for dialysis, neutrophil gelatinase‐associated lipocalin, hospital stay and mortality. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. 
Main results
We included 28 studies which randomised a total of 6851 patients. Risk of bias assessment indicated unclear to low risk of bias for most studies. For consistency regarding the direction of effects, continuous outcomes with negative values, and dichotomous outcomes with values less than one favour remote ischaemic preconditioning. Based on high quality evidence, remote ischaemic preconditioning made little or no difference to the reduction of serum creatinine levels at postoperative days one (14 studies, 1022 participants: MD ‐0.02 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐0.05 to 0.02; I2 = 21%), two (9 studies, 770 participants: MD ‐0.04 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐0.09 to 0.02; I2 = 31%), and three (6 studies, 417 participants: MD ‐0.05 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐0.19 to 0.10; I2 = 68%) compared to control. 
Serious adverse events occurred in four patients receiving remote ischaemic preconditioning by iliac clamping. It is uncertain whether remote ischaemic preconditioning by cuff inflation leads to increased adverse effects compared to control because the certainty of the evidence is low (15 studies, 3993 participants: RR 3.47, 95% CI 0.55 to 21.76; I2 = 0%); only two of 15 studies reported any adverse effects (6/1999 in the remote ischaemic preconditioning group and 1/1994 in the control group), the remaining 13 studies stated no adverse effects were observed in either group. 
Compared to control, remote ischaemic preconditioning made little or no difference to the need for dialysis (13 studies, 2417 participants: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.94; I2 = 60%; moderate quality evidence), length of hospital stay (8 studies, 920 participants: MD 0.17 days, 95% CI ‐0.46 to 0.80; I2 = 49%, high quality evidence), or all‐cause mortality (24 studies, 4931 participants: RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.37; I2 = 0%, high quality evidence). 
Remote ischaemic preconditioning may have slightly improved the incidence of acute kidney injury using either the AKIN (8 studies, 2364 participants: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.00; I2 = 61%, high quality evidence) or RIFLE criteria (3 studies, 1586 participants: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.12; I2 = 0%, moderate quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Remote ischaemic preconditioning by cuff inflation appears to be a safe method, and probably leads to little or no difference in serum creatinine, adverse effects, need for dialysis, length of hospital stay, death and in the incidence of acute kidney injury. Overall we had moderate‐high certainty evidence however the available data does not confirm the efficacy of remote ischaemic preconditioning in reducing renal ischaemia reperfusion injury in patients undergoing major cardiac and vascular surgery in which renal ischaemia reperfusion injury may occur.","Short periods of limb blood flow obstruction to reduce kidney injury
What is the issue? 
The kidney is highly sensitive to shortage in blood flow and thus oxygen supply. This may cause irreversible kidney injury leading to haemodialysis or death. Kidney injury does not only relate to the temporary lack of oxygen supply, but is also due to the re‐saturation of blood flow. At this stage, toxic products are released and initiate a reaction of the body causing further cellular damage within the kidney, the so called ‘ischaemia‐reperfusion injury’. A lack of oxygen supply to the kidney injury may have many different causes, for example blood pressure changes that may occur during major surgery. 
What did we do? 
Our hypothesis is that short harmless periods (5 minutes) of blood flow obstruction to an organ can reduce injury in this particular organ (local ischaemic preconditioning), but can also reduce injury in other organs at a distance (remote ischaemic preconditioning). A blood flow obstruction can easily and safely be achieved in a limb by inflating blood pressure cuff around the upper arm or leg. The mechanism of this remote ischaemic preconditioning is not precisely known, it is assumed that a protective signal from the remote organ to the kidney is transferred through the blood stream or nervous system. 
In this analysis our primary goal is to investigate whether remote ischaemic preconditioning is safe and effective in reducing kidney injury in patients undergoing a (surgical) procedure in which kidney injury may occur. Kidney injury after kidney transplantation may have a different underlying pathophysiology and therefore these studies are not taken into account. The impact of remote ischaemic preconditioning on the need for dialysis, hospital stay and mortality will be assessed. 
What did we find? 
We performed a search off all available literature on 8 August 2016 to find all randomised controlled studies. 28 studies including 6851 patients were included in this analysis. Five studies included children undergoing cardiac surgery. Adult studies included patients undergoing major vascular surgery (three studies), cardiac surgery (nine studies), coronary bypass surgery (10 studies) and partial kidney resection (one study). The overall quality of the studies was acceptable. 
Twenty studies were funded without economical interest. One study was funded from a source with commercial interest. The other seven studies did not report funding. 
Remote ischaemic preconditioning performed with a blood pressure cuff appears to be safe as only two of 15 studies reported adverse effects (6/1999 in the remote ischaemic preconditioning group and 1/1994 in the control group). However remote ischaemic preconditioning by vascular clamping may cause vascular complications. Kidney injury in patients undergoing (surgical) procedures in which kidney injury may occur, was not reduced by remote Ischaemic preconditioning measured at day one, two or three after surgery. The need for dialysis, hospital stay and death were not reduced by remote ischaemic preconditioning. 
Conclusion 
Although remote ischaemic preconditioning by cuff inflation is safe, available data do not confirm the efficacy of remote ischaemic preconditioning in reducing kidney injury.","# Plain Language Summary

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether a technique called ""ischaemic preconditioning"" can protect kidneys during surgery. Ischaemic preconditioning involves briefly cutting off blood flow to an arm or leg before surgery, then letting blood flow back in. Researchers wanted to know if this helps prevent kidney damage that can happen during certain surgeries.

## Who was studied?

The review included 28 studies with a total of 6,851 patients who had surgery that could injure their kidneys. These were mainly people having heart and blood vessel surgery.

## What was tested?

Doctors compared two groups:
- **Treatment group:** Patients who received ischaemic preconditioning (usually a cuff inflated on an arm or leg for short periods)
- **Control group:** Patients who did not receive this treatment

## What were the main findings?

**Kidney function:** The treatment made little or no difference in kidney function measurements after surgery.

**Safety:** The treatment appeared to be safe. Very few side effects were reported.

**Hospital outcomes:** The treatment did not change:
- How many patients needed dialysis (artificial kidney cleaning)
- How long patients stayed in the hospital
- How many patients died

**Kidney injury:** The treatment may have slightly reduced severe kidney injury, but the difference was very small.

## Bottom line

Ischaemic preconditioning by cuff inflation seems safe, but the evidence does not show it significantly helps protect kidneys during surgery.","### Plain Language Summary

#### Background
When blood flow to the kidneys is stopped and then restarted, it can cause kidney problems. A technique called ischaemic preconditioning might help protect the kidneys. This involves briefly stopping blood flow and then restoring it.

#### Objective
The study looked at whether ischaemic preconditioning helps or harms people whose kidneys might be injured during surgery.

#### How We Did the Study
Researchers gathered information from different studies up to August 2016. They focused on patients having surgeries that could affect the kidneys, but did not include kidney transplant studies.

#### What We Found
- **Participants**: The review included 28 studies with a total of 6,851 patients.
- **Key Measurements**: Researchers looked at kidney function, using measurements like serum creatinine levels, and noted any side effects and the need for dialysis.
  
- **Results**:
  - Ischaemic preconditioning showed little or no difference in protecting the kidneys based on serum creatinine levels after surgery.
  - Serious side effects were rare, but a few occurred with a method involving tightening a cuff (like a blood pressure cuff) on a limb.
  - There was little or no difference in the need for dialysis, how long patients stayed in the hospital, or in reducing deaths.
  - It may slightly reduce kidney injury, but the evidence isn't strong.

#### Conclusion
Using ischaemic preconditioning by tightening a cuff seems safe, but it doesn't significantly improve kidney protection during certain surgeries. More research is needed to confirm any benefits."
"Background
Surgery has been the treatment of choice for patients with rectal cancer. For locally advanced cancer results were poor, with high rates of locoregional recurrences and poor overall survival data. Adding (chemo)radiotherapy upfront improved results mainly in locoregional control. Adding hyperthermia to radiotherapy preoperatively might have an equivalent beneficial effect. 
Objectives
To quantify the potential beneficial effect of thermo radiation compared to chemo‐radiation with respect to pathological complete responses, overall survival and toxicity in rectal cancer therapy. 
Search methods
We identified the relevant phase II and III randomised controlled trials in any language trough electronic searches May 2007 of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2007), the Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Groups Specialised Register, MEDLINE (from 1966), EMBASE (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1982). Furthermore, various trial databases were searched for the identification of recent completed and ongoing trials (metaRegister of Controlled Trials, Cancer Research UK, Cancer.gov, The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Trials Database). All studies identified until May 2007 were considered for inclusion in the present study. 
Selection criteria
Only phase II and III randomised controlled clinical trials were included in the analysis.
Data collection and analysis
All identified studies were assessed by two independent reviewers. A weighted estimate of the treatment effect was computed for 2, 3, 4 and 5‐year survival, for local tumour recurrence, severe acute and late toxicity and complete tumour response (CR). CR was defined either clinically by disappearance of all pretreatment signs of local tumour or pathologically by microscopically free margins. The risk ratio (RR) and hazard ratio (HR) were used. Analyses were performed with the Reference Manager (RevMan). 
Main results
Six RCTs published between 1990 and 2007 were identified. A total number of 520 patients was treated, 258 in the radiotherapy only arm (RT) and 262 in the radiotherapy‐hyperthermia arm (RHT).  Four studies (424 patients) reported overall survival (OS) rates. After 2 years, OS was significantly better in the RHT group (HR 2.06; 95% CI 1.33‐3.17; p=.001), but this difference disappeared after a longer period (3, 4 and 5 year OS).  All but one studies reported CR rates. A significant higher CR rate was observed in the RHT group (RR 2.81; 95% CI 1.22‐6.45; p=.01).  Only 2 studies reported on acute toxicity. In these 2 studies no significant differences were observed between the RT and the RHT group. Late toxicity data were not reported. 
Authors' conclusions
Further studies are needed to compare chemoradiation versus thermoradiation versus chemoradiation plus hyperthermia in well selected/conducted and quality controlled randomised trials.","Hyperthermia seems to have an additional effect when added to radiotherapy in the treatment of advanced rectal cancer. 
In the past decades, radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy followed by surgery has become standard treatment for advanced rectal cancer. Chemotherapy is often added, because it enhances the effect of radiotherapy. Another method to amplify radiotherapy is heating the tumor (hyperthermia). In larger tumours there are often regions with a low oxygen concentration. Low oxygen concentrations may hamper the effect of radiotherapy. Hyperthermia can overcome this problem and is able to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy. This systematic review of the literature was done to study the additional value of hyperthermia if added to radiotherapy in advanced rectal cancer, 
Six studies were found in which 520 patients were included. Of them 258 patients were treated with radiotherapy only and 262 with the combination of chemotherapy and radiation. Four of the six studies containing 424 patients reported overall survival rates (i.e. also patients who died from other causes than cancer were reported). Overall survival after 2 years was significantly better in the group treated with the combination of hyperthermia and radiotherapy, but this difference disappeared after a longer period (3, 4 and 5 years). Five studies reported complete remission rates, i.e. a complete disappearance of the tumour. The chance to develop a complete remission was significantly higher in the combined treated patient group. Only 2 studies reported on acute toxicity (that is in general any adverse effect that develops within 3 months during and after treatment). In these 2 studies no significant differences were observed between both treatment groups. Late toxicity data (adverse effects that developed during the years following treatment) were not reported. 
In conclusion hyperthermia seems to have an additional effect when added to radiotherapy in the treatment of advanced rectal cancer. It is not possible to say if this effect is as strong as the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. More well conducted studies are needed to draw firm conclusions.","# Plain Language Summary: Heat Treatment Combined with Radiation for Rectal Cancer

## What is this study about?

This review looked at research comparing two ways to treat rectal cancer before surgery:
- **Radiation therapy alone** (RT)
- **Radiation therapy plus heat treatment** (RHT)

## Why does this matter?

Rectal cancer that has spread locally (to nearby areas) is hard to treat. Adding radiation before surgery helps, but researchers wanted to know if adding heat to the radiation could work even better.

## What did researchers do?

Scientists searched for high-quality studies comparing these two treatments. They found 6 studies from 1990 to 2007 that included 520 patients total (258 getting radiation alone, 262 getting radiation plus heat).

## What did they find?

**Good news:**
- Patients getting radiation plus heat had better results after 2 years
- More tumors completely disappeared in the radiation plus heat group
- Both treatments caused similar side effects in the short term

**Limitations:**
- The benefit from heat treatment didn't last beyond 2 years
- Not enough studies reported long-term side effects
- The studies were older and not always well-designed

## What happens next?

The researchers said more and better studies are needed to know if adding heat to radiation (or combining it with chemotherapy) really helps patients with rectal cancer.","### Plain Language Summary

**Background**
When treating rectal cancer, surgery is usually the first choice. For advanced cases, results weren't great, with high chances of the cancer coming back and lower survival rates. Adding treatments like chemotherapy and radiation before surgery helped a bit. Scientists think adding heat therapy (hyperthermia) to radiation might help too.

**What Was Studied**
The study compared two methods for treating rectal cancer before surgery: 
1. Radiation plus heat therapy (RHT)
2. Chemo-radiation (but focus here is on RHT)

The study wanted to see if adding heat therapy (RHT) helped people live longer, fully recover, and if it caused any side effects.

**How They Did It**
Researchers looked at studies done between 1990 and 2007 that tested these treatments. They included only certain types of high-quality studies with patients randomly assigned to different treatments. They checked for survival rates, cancer return, and any side effects.

**Main Findings**
- **Survival**: After 2 years, more people survived in the RHT group, but this didn't last for 3, 4, or 5 years.
- **Cancer-Free Results**: More patients had no signs of cancer with RHT.
- **Side Effects**: No big differences in short-term side effects between the groups. Long-term effects weren't available.

**Conclusion**
More research is needed to compare these treatments, ideally with even more careful and high-quality studies."
"Background
The use of peri‐implantation glucocorticoids has been advocated to improve embryo implantation during assistive reproductive technology (ART) cycles such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). It has been proposed that glucocorticoids may improve the intrauterine environment by acting as immunomodulators to reduce the uterine natural killer (NK) cell count and activity, normalising the cytokine expression profile in the endometrium and by suppression of endometrial inflammation.

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoids versus no glucocorticoids administered around the time of anticipated implantation in women undergoing IVF or ICSI. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Group specialised register, CENTRAL (now also containing output from two trial registers and CINAHL), MEDLINE and Embase, on 20 December 2021, together with reference checking, contact with experts in the field and relevant conference proceedings to identify additional studies. This review is an update of the review first published in  2007 and last updated in 2012. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of supplementary systemic administration of glucocorticoids in the peri‐implantation period with a placebo or no glucocorticoids in subfertile women undergoing IVF or ICSI were included. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. The primary review outcomes were live birth rate and multiple pregnancy. 
Main results
We included 16 RCTs (2232 couples analysed). We are uncertain whether glucocorticoids improved live birth rates (odds ratio (OR) 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 2.71; 2 RCTs, n = 366; I2 = 7%; very low‐certainty evidence). This suggests that if the chance of live birth following no glucocorticoids/placebo is assumed to be 9%, the chance following glucocorticoids would be between 6% and 21%. We are also uncertain whether there was a difference between peri‐implantation glucocorticoids on multiple pregnancy rates per couple (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.20; 4 RCTs, n = 504; I2 = 53%; very low‐certainty evidence). The I2 of 53% may represent moderate statistical heterogeneity and results have to be interpreted with caution. With regard to pregnancy rates, we are uncertain whether there was a difference between ongoing pregnancy rates after glucocorticoids versus no glucocorticoids/placebo (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.76; 3 RCTs, n = 476; I2 = 0%; very low‐certainty evidence) and clinical pregnancy rates after glucocorticoids versus no glucocorticoids/placebo (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.44; 13 RCTs, n = 1967; I2 = 0%; low‐certainty evidence). This suggests that if the chance of clinical pregnancy following no glucocorticoids/placebo is assumed to be 25%, the chance following glucocorticoids would be between 24% and 32%. Furthermore, we are also uncertain whether peri‐implantation glucocorticoids influenced miscarriage rates per couple (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.87; 6 RCTs, n = 821; I2 = 0%; very low‐certainty evidence), the incidence of ectopic pregnancies per couple (OR 2.28, 95% CI 0.33 to 15.62; 3 RCTs, n = 320; I2 = 0%; very low‐certainty evidence) and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) per couple (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.90; 3 RCTs, n = 370; I2 = 0%; very low‐certainty evidence) compared to no glucocorticoids/placebo. The evidence was very low to low certainty: the main limitations were serious risk of bias due to poor reporting of study methods, and serious imprecision. 
Authors' conclusions
Overall, there was insufficient evidence that administration of peri‐implantation glucocorticoids in IVF/ICSI cycles influenced clinical outcomes. These findings were limited to the routine use of glucocorticoids in subfertile women undergoing IVF or ICSI.","Peri‐implantation glucocorticoid administration for assisted reproductive technology cycles 
Review question 
This review investigated whether the administration of glucocorticoids around the time of embryo implantation improved the chance of pregnancy in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) when compared to no glucocorticoid administration. IVF and ICSI are both treatments to help achieve pregnancy. 
Background 
Glucocorticoids are a class of medicines that are similar to the steroid hormones that are naturally made in the body. These medicines reduce inflammation and suppress the body's immune system. Glucocorticoids suppress the inflammation of the endometrium (the tissue in the womb where the embryo implants). Therefore, glucocorticoids have been suggested to improve the chance of embryo implantation and pregnancy in women undergoing IVF or ICSI cycles. 
Study characteristics 
We found 16 randomised controlled trials (studies where treatments are decided at random; these usually give the most reliable evidence about treatment effects) comparing glucocorticoids around the time of embryo implantation versus no glucocorticoids or placebo (dummy treatment), in 2232 couples undergoing IVF/ICSI. The evidence is current to 20 December 2021. 
Key results 
Considering the quality of evidence, we are uncertain whether there was a difference in live birth rates after glucocorticoids. The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth following no glucocorticoids or placebo is assumed to be 9%, the chance following glucocorticoids would be between 6% and 21%. We are also uncertain whether there was a difference in multiple pregnancy rates (more than one embryo per pregnancy). With regard to ongoing pregnancy and clinical pregnancy rates, we are also uncertain whether there was a difference between glucocorticoids versus no glucocorticoids or placebo. The evidence suggests that if the chance of clinical pregnancy following no glucocorticoids or placebo is assumed to be 25%, the chance following glucocorticoids would be between 24% and 32%. We are also uncertain whether there was a difference in adverse events such as ectopic pregnancy, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (pain and swelling of the ovaries and tummy), but these were poorly and inconsistently reported. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was very low to low quality. The main limitations were poor reporting of study methods and the small size of included studies. More research is needed to work out the possible role of this therapy in well‐defined patient groups.","# Plain Language Summary: Steroids and Fertility Treatment

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether taking steroids (a type of medicine) around the time of embryo implantation helps women get pregnant during fertility treatments like IVF (in vitro fertilization) or ICSI (a type of IVF).

## Why might steroids help?

Some doctors thought steroids might help by:
- Reducing certain immune cells in the uterus that might prevent pregnancy
- Changing chemical signals in the uterus to make it more welcoming for an embryo
- Reducing inflammation in the uterus

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at 16 previous studies involving 2,232 couples. They compared women who received steroids around implantation time with women who received a placebo (fake medicine) or no treatment.

## What did they find?

**Main results:**
- **Live births:** We cannot be sure if steroids helped women have babies (the results were unclear)
- **Pregnancy rates:** We cannot be sure if steroids helped women get pregnant
- **Multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets):** We cannot be sure if steroids changed this rate
- **Miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, and ovarian problems:** We cannot be sure if steroids affected these

## Bottom line

There is not enough good evidence to show that taking steroids during fertility treatment helps women get pregnant or have babies. More and better research is needed.","### Plain Language Summary

**Purpose of the Study:**
This study looked at whether taking a medicine called glucocorticoids helps women undergoing IVF or similar fertility treatments to have a successful pregnancy.

**Who Was Involved:**
The study included women using IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) to help them become pregnant.

**What They Did:**
Researchers compared women who took glucocorticoids around the time they hoped the embryo would attach in the womb to those who did not take the medicine.

**What They Found:**
- The study looked at 16 smaller studies with a total of 2,232 couples.
- There wasn't clear evidence that glucocorticoids significantly improved the chance of live births. If a woman's chance without the medicine was 9%, it might be between 6% and 21% with the medicine.
- There was also no clear difference in having twins or more, ongoing pregnancies, or clinical pregnancies (when a pregnancy shows up on an ultrasound).
- The study didn’t show a clear change in miscarriage rates, ectopic pregnancies, or a condition called OHSS with glucocorticoids.

**Safety and Certainty:**
- The certainty of the results was very low to low because some studies didn’t report their methods well, and the results were not precise.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, there isn’t enough strong evidence to say that glucocorticoids help improve pregnancy outcomes in women using IVF or ICSI. More research is needed to know for sure."
"Background
Studies consistently show a relationship between social disadvantage and low birthweight. Many countries have programmes offering special assistance to women thought to be at risk for giving birth to a low birthweight infant. These programmes, collectively referred to in this review as additional social support, may include emotional support, which gives a person a feeling of being loved and cared for, tangible/instrumental support, in the form of direct assistance/home visits, and informational support, through the provision of advice, guidance and counselling. The programmes may be delivered by multidisciplinary teams of health professionals, specially trained lay workers, or a combination of lay and professional workers. This is an update of a review first published in 2003 and updated in 2010. 
Objectives
The primary objective was to assess the effects of programmes offering additional social support (emotional, instrumental/tangible and informational) compared with routine care, for pregnant women believed to be at high risk for giving birth to babies that are either preterm (less than 37 weeks' gestation) or weigh less than 2500 g, or both, at birth. Secondary objectives were to determine whether the effectiveness of support was mediated by timing of onset (early versus later in pregnancy) or type of provider (healthcare professional or lay person). 
Search methods
For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 5 February 2018, and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials of additional social support during at‐risk pregnancy by either a professional (social worker, midwife, or nurse) or specially trained lay person, compared to routine care. We defined additional social support as some form of emotional support (e.g. caring, empathy, trust), tangible/instrumental support (e.g. transportation to clinic appointments, home visits complemented with phone calls, help with household responsibilities) or informational support (advice and counselling about nutrition, rest, stress management, use of alcohol/recreational drugs). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
This updated review includes a total of 25 studies, with outcome data for 11,246 mothers and babies enrolled in 21 studies. We assessed the overall risk of bias of included studies to be low or unclear, mainly because of limited reporting or uncertainty in how randomisation was generated or concealed (which led us to downgrade the quality of most outcomes to moderate), and the impracticability of blinding participants. 
When compared with routine care, programmes offering additional social support for at‐risk pregnant women may slightly reduce the number of babies born with a birthweight less than 2500 g from 127 per 1000 to 120 per 1000 (risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.04; 16 studies, n = 11,770; moderate‐quality evidence), and the number of babies born with a gestational age less than 37 weeks at birth from 128 per 1000 to 117 per 1000 (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01, 14 studies, n = 12,282; moderate‐quality evidence), though the confidence intervals for the pooled effect for both of these outcomes just crossed the line of no effect, suggesting any effect is not large. There may be little or no difference between interventions for stillbirth/neonatal death (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.41; 15 studies, n = 12,091; low‐quality evidence). Secondary outcomes of moderate quality suggested that there is probably a reduction in caesarean section (from 215 per 1000 to 194 per 1000; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.97; 15 studies, n = 9550), a reduction in the number of antenatal hospital admissions per participant (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.91; 4 studies; n = 787), and a reduction in the mean number of hospitalisation episodes (mean difference −0.05, 95% CI −0.06 to −0.04; 1 study, n = 1525) in the social support group, compared to the controls. 
Postnatal depression and women's satisfaction were reported in different ways in the studies that considered these outcomes and so we could not include data in a meta‐analysis. In one study postnatal depression appeared to be slightly lower in the support group in women who screened positively on the Edinbugh Postnatal Depression Scale at eight to 12 weeks postnatally (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.01; 1 study, n = 1008; moderate‐quality evidence). In another study, again postnatal depression appeared to be slightly lower in the support group and this was a self‐report measure assessed at six weeks postnatally (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.05; 1 study, n = 458; low‐quality evidence). A higher proportion of women in one study reported that their prenatal care was very helpful in the supported group (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.30; 1 study, n = 223; moderate‐quality evidence), although in another study results were similar. Another study assessed satisfaction with prenatal care as being ""not good"" in 51 of 945 in the additional support group, compared with 45 of 942 in the usual care group. 
No studies considered long‐term morbidity for the infant. No single outcome was reported in all studies. Subgroup analysis demonstrated consistency of effect when the support was provided by a healthcare professional or a trained lay worker. 
The descriptions of the additional social support were generally consistent across all studies and included emotional support, tangible support such as home visits, and informational support. 
Authors' conclusions
Pregnant women need the support of caring family members, friends, and health professionals. While programmes that offer additional social support during pregnancy are unlikely to have a large impact on the proportion of low birthweight babies or birth before 37 weeks' gestation and no impact on stillbirth or neonatal death, they may be helpful in reducing the likelihood of caesarean birth and antenatal hospital admission.","Support during pregnancy for women at increased risk of low birthweight babies
What is the issue? 
Babies can have a low birthweight if they are born early, before 37 weeks gestational age, or are born small because the mother was poorly nourished through the pregnancy. Poverty can lead to malnutrition, unhealthy living environments, increased risk of infection, and increased stress in daily life. The social stigma associated with being marginalised in society is also a cause of stress. Babies whose growth has been restricted during pregnancy are more likely to die around the time of birth or to suffer from health problems. 
Why is this important? 
Many countries offer programmes giving special assistance to women thought to be at risk of giving birth to low birthweight babies. These programmes can include emotional support, direct assistance such as home visits, transportation to clinic appointments or help with household responsibilities, and informational support such as guidance and counselling. We set out to assess the effects of programmes offering additional social support compared with routine care, for pregnant women believed to be at high risk of giving birth to low birthweight babies. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence on 5 February 2018. We identified 21 randomised controlled trials from which 11,246 mother‐baby pairs contributed results for this review. Examples of the additional social support include information, home visits, telephone calls and stress management. The overall quality of evidence for most outcomes was moderate. It was not possible to blind women to which group they were in. 
We found that women who received additional social support during pregnancy may be slightly less likely to have a baby with low birthweight (16 studies, 11,770 babies), or give birth too early (14 studies, 12,282 babies). The number of babies that died around the time of birth was similar for both groups of women (15 studies, 12,091 babies). Women who received the additional social support were, however, probably less likely to be admitted to hospital during their pregnancy (4 studies, 787 women), or to have a caesarean birth (15 studies, 9550 women). Women with additional social support may be less likely to be depressed (1 study, 1008 women). Findings around satisfaction with care were mixed, with one study reporting the support group being more satisfied, whilst another study suggested women in the usual care group were more satisfied. The findings did not appear to be different if the social support was provided by trained lay people or health professionals. 
What does this mean? 
Although programmes that offer additional social support during pregnancy are unlikely to prevent the pregnancy from resulting in a low birthweight or early birth, before 37 weeks of pregnancy, they may be helpful in reducing the likelihood of antenatal hospital admissions and the need for caesarean births. 
Additional social support is not powerful enough to improve the outcomes of the pregnancy during which it is provided, as measured by the outcomes considered in this review. The factors contributing to deprivation require social change in order to bring about improvements in health for mothers and their newborn babies.","# Plain Language Summary: Social Support Programs for Pregnant Women at Risk

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether special support programs help pregnant women who are at risk of having babies born too early or too small. Researchers combined results from 25 different studies involving over 11,000 mothers and babies.

## Who was studied?

Pregnant women who doctors thought had a higher chance of delivering babies that were:
- Born before 37 weeks of pregnancy, OR
- Weighing less than 2,500 grams (about 5.5 pounds) at birth

## What kind of support was tested?

The programs offered three types of help:

1. **Emotional support** – Someone to listen, show they care, and make the mother feel loved
2. **Practical help** – Things like rides to doctor visits, home visits, phone calls, and help with household tasks
3. **Information and advice** – Guidance about eating well, getting rest, managing stress, and avoiding harmful substances

Support was provided by either healthcare workers (nurses, midwives, social workers) or specially trained community members.

## What were the results?

**Babies' birth weight and timing:**
- Social support programs made only a small difference in preventing low birthweight babies
- They made only a small difference in preventing early birth
- They did not reduce stillbirth or newborn death

**Other benefits found:**
- Fewer mothers needed cesarean sections (surgical delivery)
- Fewer mothers needed hospital stays during pregnancy
- Mothers reported slightly higher satisfaction with their prenatal care
- Mothers showed slightly lower rates of depression after birth

## Bottom line

While social support programs during pregnancy don't prevent most cases of low birthweight or early birth, they may help reduce the need for cesarean sections and hospital stays. They also help mothers feel more satisfied with their care.","### Plain Language Summary

**What's Being Studied?**

This study looked at special support programs for pregnant women who might have babies born too early or too small. These programs aim to provide extra help compared to regular care.

**Who Was Involved?**

The study included over 11,000 moms and babies from 25 different studies.

**What Was Done?**

The support programs offered different types of help, like emotional support, direct assistance such as home visits, and advice or counseling. This extra support was given by health professionals or trained helpers, along with regular medical care.

**What Did They Find?**

- **Babies' Weight and Early Birth:** The programs might slightly reduce the number of babies born too small or too early, but the difference isn't big.
- **Caesarean Sections:** There was a small decrease in the number of C-sections.
- **Hospital Visits:** Moms had fewer hospital visits for pregnancy check-ups.
- **Postnatal Depression:** Some studies said moms had slightly less depression after the baby was born, but the results varied.
- **Satisfaction:** Many moms felt more satisfied with their pregnancy care when they received extra support.

**Safety and Quality:**

The study quality was generally good, but some details weren't reported clearly in all studies.

**Conclusion:**

Extra support programs during pregnancy might not greatly change baby sizes or early births, but they can help reduce C-sections and hospital visits. Having caring support from family, friends, and health workers is important for pregnant women."
"Background
Cultural competence education for health professionals aims to ensure all people receive equitable, effective health care, particularly those from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds. It has emerged as a strategy in high‐income English‐speaking countries in response to evidence of health disparities, structural inequalities, and poorer quality health care and outcomes among people from minority CALD backgrounds. However there is a paucity of evidence to link cultural competence education with patient, professional and organisational outcomes. To assess efficacy, for this review we developed a four‐dimensional conceptual framework comprising educational content, pedagogical approach, structure of the intervention, and participant characteristics to provide consistency in describing and assessing interventions. We use the term 'CALD participants' when referring to minority CALD populations as a whole. When referring to participants in included studies we describe them in terms used by study authors. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of cultural competence education interventions for health professionals on patient‐related outcomes, health professional outcomes, and healthcare organisation outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched: MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to June 2012); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library) (June 2012); EMBASE (OvidSP) (1988 to June 2012); CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (1981 to June 2012); PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1806 to June 2012); Proquest Dissertations and Theses database (1861 to October 2011); ERIC (CSA) (1966 to October 2011); LILACS (1982 to March 2012); and Current Contents (OvidSP) (1993 Week 27 to June 2012). 
Searches in MEDLINE, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Proquest Dissertations and Theses, ERIC and Current Contents were updated in February 2014. Searches in CINAHL were updated in March 2014. 
There were no language restrictions.
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, and controlled clinical trials of educational interventions for health professionals working in health settings that aimed to improve: health outcomes of patients/consumers of minority cultural and linguistic backgrounds; knowledge, skills and attitudes of health professionals in delivering culturally competent care; and healthcare organisation performance in culturally competent care. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the conceptual framework as the basis for data extraction. Two review authors independently extracted data on interventions, methods, and outcome measures and mapped them against the framework. Additional information was sought from study authors. We present results in narrative and tabular form. 
Main results
We included five RCTs involving 337 healthcare professionals and 8400 patients; at least 3463 (41%) were from CALD backgrounds. Trials compared the effects of cultural competence training for health professionals, with no training. Three studies were from the USA, one from Canada and one from The Netherlands. They involved health professionals of diverse backgrounds, although most were not from CALD minorities. Cultural background was determined using a validated scale (one study), self‐report (two studies) or not reported (two studies). The design effect from clustering meant an effective minimum sample size of 3164 CALD participants. No meta‐analyses were performed. The quality of evidence for each outcome was judged to be low. 
Two trials comparing cultural competence training with no training found no evidence of effect for treatment outcomes, including the proportion of patients with diabetes achieving LDL cholesterol control targets (risk difference (RD) ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.06 to 0.02; 1 study, USA, 2699 ""black"" patients, moderate quality), or change in weight loss (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.07, 95% CI ‐0.41 to 0.55, 1 study, USA, effective sample size (ESS) 68 patients, low quality). 
Health behaviour (client concordance with attendance) improved significantly among intervention participants compared with controls (relative risk (RR) 1.53, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.27, 1 study, USA, ESS 28 women, low quality). Involvement in care by ""non‐Western"" patients (described as ""mainly Turkish, Moroccan, Cape Verdean and Surinamese patients"") with largely ""Western"" doctors improved in terms of mutual understanding (SMD 0.21, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.42, 1 study, The Netherlands, 109 patients, low quality). Evaluations of care were mixed (three studies). Two studies found no evidence of effect in: proportion of patients reporting satisfaction with consultations (RD 0.14, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.31, 1 study, The Netherlands, 109 patients, low quality); patient scores of physician cultural competency (SMD 0.11 95% CI ‐0.63 to 0.85, 1 study, USA, ESS 68 ""Caucasian"" and ""non‐Causcasian"" patients (described as Latino, African American, Asian and other, low quality). Client perceptions of health professionals were significantly higher in the intervention group (SMD 1.60 95% CI 1.05 to 2.15, 1 study, USA, ESS 28 ""Black"" women, low quality). 
No study assessed adverse outcomes.
There was no evidence of effect on clinician awareness of ""racial"" differences in quality of care among clients at a USA health centre (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.94. P = 0.07) with no adjustment for clustering. Included studies did not measure other outcomes of interest. Sensitivity analyses using different values for the Intra‐cluster coefficient (ICC) did not substantially alter the magnitude or significance of summary effect sizes. 
All four domains of the conceptual framework were addressed, suggesting agreement on core components of cultural competence education interventions may be possible. 
Authors' conclusions
Cultural competence continues to be developed as a major strategy to address health inequities. Five studies assessed the effects of cultural competence education for health professionals on patient‐related outcomes. There was positive, albeit low‐quality evidence, showing improvements in the involvement of CALD patients. Findings either showed support for the educational interventions or no evidence of effect. No studies assessed adverse outcomes. The quality of evidence is insufficient to draw generalisable conclusions, largely due to heterogeneity of the interventions in content, scope, design, duration, implementation and outcomes selected. 
Further research is required to establish greater methodological rigour and uniformity on core components of education interventions, including how they are described and evaluated. Our conceptual framework provides a basis for establishing consensus to improve reporting and allow assessment across studies and populations. Future studies should measure the patient outcomes used: treatment outcomes; health behaviours; involvement in care and evaluations of care. Studies should also measure the impact of these types of interventions on healthcare organisations, as these are likely to affect uptake and sustainability.","Cultural competence education for health professionals
This review assessed the effects of cultural competence education for health professionals. Five studies were included involving 337 health professionals (including general practitioners, primary care teams and counsellors) and 8400 patients. Three studies were conducted in the USA, one in Canada and one in The Netherlands. At least 3000 patients were from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds and some of the health professional groups were also from CALD backgrounds. Due to differences in terminology and their cultural meanings, and the evolving nature of concepts and practices in this area, in this review we use the term 'CALD participants' when referring to minority, CALD populations as a whole. When referring to participants in included studies we describe them in the terms used by the relevant study authors. 
The studies differed in how the education was provided and which outcome measures were used. Involvement in care improved in one study in The Netherlands measuring mutual understanding between minority CALD background patients and their doctors. Health behaviour also changed in one small study in the USA, in which women whose counsellors had received education were three times more likely to attend planned counselling sessions. However there was no evidence of an effect on a range of treatment outcomes or evaluations of care. None of the five included studies examined the effect of cultural competence education on healthcare organisations, or assessed adverse outcomes. 
The review findings showed some support for cultural competence education for health professionals. These findings are tentative, however, as the quality of the evidence was low and more data are needed. Future research on cultural competence education for health professionals should seek greater consensus on the core components of cultural competence education, how participants are described and the outcomes assessed.","# Plain Language Summary: Cultural Competence Training for Healthcare Workers

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether training programs help healthcare workers provide better care to patients from different cultural and language backgrounds. The goal was to see if this training improves patient health, helps healthcare workers do their jobs better, and makes healthcare organizations work more smoothly.

## Who was involved?

Researchers reviewed 5 studies that included 337 healthcare workers and about 8,400 patients. At least 3,463 patients (41%) were from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Most studies were from the USA, with one each from Canada and The Netherlands.

## What did the studies test?

The studies compared healthcare workers who received cultural competence training with those who did not receive any training. The training taught workers how to better understand and care for patients from different cultural backgrounds.

## What were the main findings?

**Patient health outcomes:** Training did not clearly improve whether patients reached health goals (like controlling cholesterol or losing weight).

**Patient behavior:** Patients whose doctors received training were more likely to attend their appointments.

**Patient involvement:** Patients felt more understood by their doctors after the doctors received training.

**Patient satisfaction:** Results were mixed—some studies found no difference in how satisfied patients were with their care.

**Healthcare worker awareness:** Training did not clearly increase workers' awareness of differences in care quality.

## Safety

No studies looked at whether the training caused any harm.

## Bottom line

The studies found some positive results, but the evidence is not strong enough to say for certain that cultural competence training works. More research with better study designs is needed.","### Plain Language Summary

**What was this study about?**

This study looked at training programs for healthcare workers to help them understand and care for people from different cultural backgrounds. These programs aim to make sure everyone gets good healthcare, no matter their culture or language. The research tried to find out if this training actually benefits patients, healthcare workers, and hospitals.

**Who was involved?**

The study included five different research projects with 337 healthcare workers and about 8,400 patients. Many of these patients came from different cultural backgrounds. The studies took place in the USA, Canada, and The Netherlands.

**What did they do?**

The healthcare workers in these studies were either given special cultural training or no training. Researchers then checked to see if the training had any effects on patient care and health worker skills.

**What did they find out?**

1. **Patient Health:** In two studies, there was no clear evidence that the training improved patient health, like controlling cholesterol or losing weight.

2. **Participation in Care:** Some patients were more involved and understood their care better after healthcare workers received training. For example, certain groups like Turkish and Moroccan patients felt better understood by their doctors.

3. **Health Worker Skills:** There wasn't strong evidence showing that healthcare workers became more aware of cultural differences.

4. **Patient Opinions:** Some patients had better opinions of health workers after the training.

5. **Safety:** No problems or harmful effects were found from the training.

**What do the results mean?**

The study results were mixed. Some showed positive effects from the training, while others did not show much change. The evidence wasn’t strong enough to make big conclusions, mostly because the studies were different in many ways.

**What’s next?**

More research is needed to clearly understand how cultural training can make healthcare better. Future studies should focus on how it affects patients and hospitals, and should use consistent methods and measurements to make the results more reliable."
"Background
Each year approximately 350,000 women in the United Kingdom and millions more worldwide, experience perineal suturing following childbirth. The postpartum management of perineal trauma is a core component of routine maternity care. However, for those women whose perineal wound dehisces (breaks down), the management varies depending on individual practitioners preferences as there is limited scientific evidence and no clear guidelines to inform best practice. For most women the wound will be managed expectantly whereas, others may be offered secondary suturing. 
Objectives
To evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of secondary suturing of dehisced perineal wounds compared to non‐suturing (healing by secondary intention, expectancy).

Randomised controlled trials of secondary suturing of dehisced perineal wounds (second‐, third‐ or fourth‐degree tear or episiotomy), following wound debridement and the removal of any remaining suture material within the first six weeks following childbirth compared with non‐suturing. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. 
Main results
Two small studies of poor methodological quality including 52 women with a dehisced and/or infected episiotomy wound at point of entry have been included. 
Only one small study presented data in relation to wound healing at less than four weeks, (the primary outcome measure for this review), although no reference was made to demonstrate how healing was measured. There was a trend to favour this outcome in the resuturing group, however, this difference was not statistically significant (risk ratio (RR) 1.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 3.88, one study, 17 women). 
Similarly, only one trial reported on rates of dyspareunia (a secondary outcome measure for this review) at two months and six months with no statistically significant difference between both groups; two months, (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.11, one study, 26 women) and six months, (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.87, one study 32 women). This trial also included data on the numbers of women who resumed sexual intercourse by two months and six months. Significantly more women in the secondary suturing group had resumed intercourse by two months (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.89, one study, 35 women), although by six months there was no significant difference between the two groups (RR 1.08, 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.28). 
Neither of the trials included data in relation to the following prespecified secondary outcome measures: pain at any time interval; the woman's satisfaction with the aesthetic results of the perineal wound; exclusive breastfeeding; maternal anxiety or depression. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on this review, there is currently insufficient evidence available to either support or refute secondary suturing for the management of broken down perineal wounds following childbirth. There is an urgent need for a robust randomised controlled trial to evaluate fully the comparative effects of both treatment options.","Re‐stitching broken down perineal (the area between the vagina and back passage) wounds compared with non‐stitching 
It is estimated that 350,000 women per year in the United Kingdom and millions more worldwide experience perineal stitches because of a childbirth‐related natural tear or cut (episiotomy). Sometimes the perineal wound breaks down (opens up). This may be because it becomes infected, which could lead to systemic infection and sepsis. The current management of broken down wounds varies widely between individual health practitioners and hospitals. For most women the broken down perineal wound is left to heal naturally (managed expectantly). This is a slow process and it can take several weeks for the wound to heal completely resulting in persistent pain and discomfort at the perineal wound site, also possible urinary retention and defecation problems. The alternative is re‐stitching. Due to the lack of research evidence, we do not know the best way to treat this type of complication. This review looked at randomised controlled trials of re‐stitching broken down wounds compared with non‐stitching. Two small studies were identified. One study, involving 17 women, showed a marginal tendency to improved healing in the women who were re‐stitched, however, this evidence was not conclusive. In the other study involving 35 women, more women had resumed intercourse in the re‐suturing group at two months. As the studies were small and of poor quality, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the best way to manage wound breakdown after childbirth. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct further studies to compare fully the benefits and risks of both treatments.","# Plain Language Summary: Perineal Wound Care After Childbirth

## What is this study about?

After giving birth, many women have cuts or tears in the area between the vagina and anus (called the perineum). These wounds are usually stitched closed. Sometimes these stitches break down or come apart. This study looked at two ways to treat broken-down wounds: stitching them again versus letting them heal on their own without new stitches.

## Why does this matter?

About 350,000 women in the United Kingdom have perineal stitches each year. When these wounds break down, doctors don't always agree on the best way to treat them. Some doctors re-stitch the wound, while others let it heal naturally. The researchers wanted to find out which approach works better.

## What did they do?

The researchers looked for studies that compared re-stitching broken-down perineal wounds to letting them heal without new stitches. They found only 2 small studies that included 52 women total.

## What did they find?

The studies were small and not very well done, so the results weren't clear:

- **Wound healing**: One study suggested re-stitching might help wounds heal faster, but the difference wasn't strong enough to be sure.
- **Sexual activity**: More women who got re-stitched were able to have sex by 2 months, but by 6 months both groups were similar.
- **Pain and satisfaction**: The studies didn't measure these important things.

## Bottom line

There isn't enough good evidence yet to say whether re-stitching or letting wounds heal naturally is better. Doctors need to do a larger, better-quality study to find the answer.","**Plain Language Summary**

Every year, many women in the UK and worldwide need stitches after childbirth. Sometimes, these stitches can come apart, and doctors handle this situation in different ways because there's no clear guideline.

**Purpose**

This study looks at whether re-stitching these wounds (secondary suturing) is better than just letting them heal on their own.

**How We Studied This**

Researchers found studies done before 2013 and looked at trials where women with wound issues after childbirth were either re-stitched or not. Two small, less reliable studies with 52 women were reviewed.

**Findings**

- One study checked how quickly wounds healed in under four weeks but did not find strong proof that re-stitching was better.
- Another measured pain during intercourse two and six months later with no clear difference between groups.
- More women who got re-stitched resumed sexual activity by two months, but by six months, there was no difference.
- The studies did not cover pain, satisfaction with the wound's appearance, or impacts on breastfeeding or mental health.

**Conclusion**

Right now, we don't have enough evidence to say if re-stitching is better. More detailed studies are needed to understand the best approach."
"Background
Tuberculous pericarditis can impair the heart's function and cause death; long term, it can cause the membrane to fibrose and constrict causing heart failure. In addition to antituberculous chemotherapy, treatments include corticosteroids, drainage, and surgery. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of treatments for tuberculous pericarditis.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (27 March 2017); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library (2017, Issue 2); MEDLINE (1966 to 27 March 2017); Embase (1974 to 27 March 2017); and LILACS (1982 to 27 March 2017). In addition we searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal using 'tuberculosis' and 'pericard*' as search terms on 27 March 2017. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and contacted researchers in the field of tuberculous pericarditis. This is a new version of the original 2002 review. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened search outputs, evaluated study eligibility, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data; and we resolved any discrepancies by discussion and consensus. One trial assessed the effects of both corticosteroid and Mycobacterium indicus pranii treatment in a two‐by‐two factorial design; we excluded data from the group that received both interventions. We conducted fixed‐effect meta‐analysis and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Seven trials met the inclusion criteria; all were from sub‐Saharan Africa and included 1959 participants, with 1051/1959 (54%) HIV‐positive. All trials evaluated corticosteroids and one each evaluated colchicine, M. indicus pranii immunotherapy, and open surgical drainage. Four trials (1841 participants) were at low risk of bias, and three trials (118 participants) were at high risk of bias. 
In people who are not infected with HIV, corticosteroids may reduce deaths from all causes (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.09; 660 participants, 4 trials, low certainty evidence) and the need for repeat pericardiocentesis (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.04; 492 participants, 2 trials, low certainty evidence). Corticosteroids probably reduce deaths from pericarditis (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.80; 660 participants, 4 trials, moderate certainty evidence). However, we do not know whether or not corticosteroids have an effect on constriction or cancer among HIV‐negative people (very low certainty evidence). 
In people living with HIV, only 19.9% (203/1959) were on antiretroviral drugs. Corticosteroids may reduce constriction (RR 0.55, 0.26 to 1.16; 575 participants, 3 trials, low certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether corticosteroids have an effect on all‐cause death or cancer (very low certainty evidence); and may have little or no effect on repeat pericardiocentesis (RR 1.02, 0.89 to 1.18; 517 participants, 2 trials, low certainty evidence). 
For colchicine among people living with HIV, we found one small trial (33 participants) which had insufficient data to make any conclusions about any effects on death or constrictive pericarditis. 
Irrespective of HIV status, due to very low certainty evidence from one trial, it is uncertain whether adding M. indicus pranii immunotherapy to antituberculous drugs has an effect on any outcome. 
Open surgical drainage for effusion may reduce repeat pericardiocentesis In HIV‐negative people (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.76; 122 participants, 1 trial, low certainty evidence) but may make little or no difference to other outcomes. We did not find an eligible trial that assessed the effects of open surgical drainage in people living with HIV. 
The review authors found no eligible trials that examined the length of antituberculous treatment needed nor the effects of other adjunctive treatments for tuberculous pericarditis. 
Authors' conclusions
For HIV‐negative patients, corticosteroids may reduce death. For HIV‐positive patients not on antiretroviral drugs, corticosteroids may reduce constriction. For HIV‐positive patients with good antiretroviral drug viral suppression, clinicians may consider the results from HIV‐negative patients more relevant. 
Further research may help evaluate percutaneous drainage of the pericardium under local anaesthesia, the timing of pericardiectomy in tuberculous constrictive pericarditis, and new antibiotic regimens.","Treatment for tuberculosis infection of the membrane around the heart
What is the issue? 
Tuberculosis infection of the pericardium surrounding the heart is uncommon but life‐threatening.
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to assess the effects of treatments for people with tuberculous pericarditis. 
What is this important? 
Doctors prescribe antituberculous drugs for six months, drain fluid from the pericardium if the patient has heart failure, and sometimes remove the pericardium if it is thick and making the patient ill and sometimes give corticosteroids to reduce the effects of the inflammation. 
What are the main results of the review? 
Cochrane researchers collected and examined all potentially relevant studies and found seven trials, all conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa. Six trials evaluated corticosteroids. Other treatments evaluated included Mycobacterium indicus pranii immunotherapy, colchicine, and surgical removal of fluid under general anaesthesia. This review is a new edition of the 2002 review. 
In people not infected with HIV, six trials found that additional steroids may reduce deaths overall (low certainty evidence) and probably reduce deaths caused by pericarditis (moderate certainty evidence). Steroids may prevent reaccumulation of fluid in the pericardial space (low certainty evidence). However, we do not know whether or not corticosteroids have an effect on constriction or cancer among HIV‐negative people (very low certainty evidence). 
In people living with HIV, most people evaluated in the included trials were not on antiretroviral drugs. For these patients, corticosteroids may reduce constrictive pericarditis (low certainty evidence), but we do not know if this translates into a reduction in the number of deaths or cancer (very low certainty evidence). Corticosteroids may have little or no effect on reaccumulation of fluid in the pericardial space (low certainty evidence). 
Colchicine was evaluated in one trial of 33 people, with insufficient data to make any conclusions about an effect. 
Based on one trial, it is uncertain whether adding M. indicus pranii immunotherapy to antituberculous drugs has an effect on any outcome in people with tuberculous pericarditis regardless of their HIV status (very low certainty evidence). 
Open surgical drainage of the fluid accumulating between the heart and the membrane using general anaesthesia may be associated with less life‐threatening reaccumulation of fluid in people who are not infected with HIV, but conclusions are not possible as the number of participants studied was too small. We did not find an eligible trial that assessed the effects of open surgical drainage in people living with HIV. 
The review authors found no eligible trials that examined the length of antituberculous treatment needed nor the effects of other adjunctive treatments for tuberculous pericarditis. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for trials published up to 27 March 2017.","# Plain Language Summary: Treatments for Tuberculosis of the Heart Lining

## What is this study about?

This review looked at research studies testing different treatments for tuberculosis (TB) of the heart lining (the thin tissue around the heart). TB of the heart lining can damage how the heart works and can be life-threatening. Over time, it can cause scarring that makes the heart work even worse.

## Why is this important?

Doctors treat TB of the heart lining with TB medicines, but they also use other treatments like steroids (medicines that reduce swelling), draining fluid from around the heart, or surgery. Researchers wanted to know which treatments work best.

## What did researchers do?

Scientists searched medical databases for studies that tested different treatments for TB of the heart lining. They found 7 studies from Africa that included 1,959 people. About half of these people also had HIV.

## What did they find?

**For people without HIV:**
- Steroid medicines may lower the number of deaths
- Steroids probably help reduce deaths specifically from the heart lining disease
- Steroids may reduce the need to drain fluid from the heart more than once

**For people with HIV:**
- Steroids may help prevent scarring of the heart lining
- It's unclear if steroids help prevent death in people with HIV
- Draining fluid surgically may reduce the need for repeat draining procedures

**Other treatments:**
- There wasn't enough information about other medicines tested

## What's next?

Doctors need more research to understand the best timing for surgery and whether newer TB medicines work better.","**Summary of Clinical Trial on Treatments for Tuberculous Pericarditis**

**What is Tuberculous Pericarditis?**
Tuberculous pericarditis is a condition that affects the heart. It can make it hard for the heart to work properly and might even lead to heart failure.

**Objective of the Study**
This study looked at different treatments for tuberculous pericarditis to see how well they work.

**Who Participated?**
The study involved 1,959 people from sub-Saharan Africa. More than half of them had HIV.

**What Treatments Were Tested?**
1. **Corticosteroids**: Used to reduce inflammation.
2. **Colchicine**: Tested in a small group; results were unclear.
3. **M. Indicus Pranii Immunotherapy**: Tested to see if it boosts treatment.
4. **Open Surgical Drainage**: Tested for its effectiveness in removing fluid.

**What Were the Findings?**
- **Corticosteroids**: 
  - In people without HIV, they might lower the risk of death and reduce the need for repeating certain heart procedures.
  - In people with HIV, they may reduce heart constriction but it's unclear if they affect overall survival.
  
- **Other Treatments**: 
  - **Colchicine and Immunotherapy**: Not enough data to draw conclusions.
  - **Surgical Drainage**: Might be helpful to reduce repeated procedures in people without HIV.

**Safety and Certainty**
The evidence varies in certainty. Corticosteroids showed some positive effects, but more research is needed, especially for other treatments.

**Future Research**
Further studies could explore more about drainage methods, timing of certain surgeries, and new drugs for fighting tuberculosis in these patients.

**Conclusion**
Corticosteroids might be beneficial, especially in people without HIV. The study shows areas where more research is needed to improve treatment of tuberculous pericarditis."
"Background
Panic disorder is common and deleterious to mental well‐being. Psychological therapies and pharmacological interventions are both used as treatments for panic disorder with and without agoraphobia. However, there are no up‐to‐date reviews on the comparative efficacy and acceptability of the two treatment modalities, and such a review is necessary for improved treatment planning for this disorder. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and acceptability of psychological therapies versus pharmacological interventions for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group Specialised Register on 11 September 2015. This register contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950 to present), Embase (1974 to present), and PsycINFO (1967 to present). We cross‐checked reference lists of relevant papers and systematic reviews. We did not apply any restrictions on date, language, or publication status. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials comparing psychological therapies with pharmacological interventions for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia as diagnosed by operationalised criteria in adults. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved any disagreements in consultation with a third review author. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using standardised mean differences (with 95% CI). We used the random‐effects model throughout. 
Main results
We included 16 studies with a total of 966 participants in the present review. Eight of the studies were conducted in Europe, four in the USA, two in the Middle East, and one in Southeast Asia. 
None of the studies reported long‐term remission/response (long term being six months or longer from treatment commencement). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.17; 6 studies; 334 participants) or short‐term response (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.86; 5 studies; 277 participants) (very low‐quality evidence), and no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and SSRIs in treatment acceptability as measured using dropouts for any reason (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.22; 6 studies; 334 participants; low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and tricyclic antidepressants in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09; 3 studies; 229 participants), short‐term response (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.10; 4 studies; 270 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.30; 5 studies; 430 participants) (low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and other antidepressants in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.67; 3 studies; 135 participants; very low‐quality evidence) and evidence that psychological therapies did not significantly increase or decrease the short‐term response over other antidepressants (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.37; 3 studies; 128 participants) or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.65; 3 studies; 180 participants) (low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and benzodiazepines in terms of short‐term remission (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.65; 3 studies; 95 participants), short‐term response (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.58; 2 studies; 69 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.36; 3 studies; 116 participants) (very low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressant alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.05; 11 studies; 663 participants) and short‐term response (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; 12 studies; 800 participants) (low‐quality evidence), and there was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressants alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of treatment acceptability as measured by dropouts for any reason (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.51; 13 studies; 909 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The risk of selection bias and reporting bias was largely unclear. Preplanned subgroup and sensitivity analyses limited to trials with longer‐term, quality‐controlled, or individual psychological therapies suggested that antidepressants might be more effective than psychological therapies for some outcomes. 
There were no data to contribute to a comparison between psychological therapies and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and subsequent adverse effects. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence in this review was often imprecise. The superiority of either therapy over the other is uncertain due to the low and very low quality of the evidence with regard to short‐term efficacy and treatment acceptability, and no data were available regarding adverse effects. 
The sensitivity analysis and investigation of the sources of heterogeneity indicated three possible influential factors: quality control of psychological therapies, the length of intervention, and the individual modality of psychological therapies. 
Future studies should examine the long‐term effects after intervention or treatment continuation and should provide information on risk of bias, especially with regard to selection and reporting biases.","Psychological therapies versus medication for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults 
Why is this review important? 
Panic disorder is common and harmful to mental well‐being. Psychological therapies and medication (usually antidepressants or benzodiazepines) are effective against panic disorder. However, there are no up‐to‐date reviews on the superiority and acceptability of these two forms of treatment, and such a review is necessary to improve treatment planning for this disorder. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
Adult patients, professionals working in mental health services, and general practitioners.
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
The present review aims to answer the following questions:
• Are psychological therapies more effective than antidepressants or benzodiazepines?
• Are psychological therapies more acceptable than antidepressants or benzodiazepines?
Which studies were included in the review? 
We searched databases to find all trials published between 1950 and September 2015 comparing psychological therapies with antidepressants or benzodiazepines for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults. To be included in the review, the studies had to be randomised controlled trials and had to include people with a clear diagnosis of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. 
We included 16 studies with a total of 966 participants in the review. We rated the overall quality of the evidence from these studies as very low to moderate. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
The superiority or inferiority of psychological therapies over drugs remains unclear with regard to treatment effectiveness and acceptability. 
None of the studies reported information regarding long‐term effectiveness and quality of life. 
What should happen next? 
The review authors recommend that future research should use less biased psychological therapies, evaluate long‐term outcomes, and report information related to the risk of study bias.","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Talk Therapy and Medicine for Panic Disorder

## What is this study about?

This review looked at research comparing two main ways to treat panic disorder: talk therapy (psychological therapy) and medicine (medications). Panic disorder is a condition where people have sudden, intense feelings of fear or panic. The goal was to figure out which treatment works better.

## Who was studied?

The review included 16 studies with a total of 966 adults who had panic disorder. The studies were done in Europe, the United States, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.

## What treatments were compared?

**Talk therapy** included psychological treatments like counseling.

**Medicines** included:
- SSRIs (a common type of antidepressant)
- Tricyclic antidepressants (an older type of antidepressant)
- Other antidepressants
- Benzodiazepines (calming medications)
- Combinations of antidepressants and benzodiazepines

## What did they measure?

Researchers looked at whether people got better (remission or response) and whether people quit treatment early.

## Main findings

**The bottom line:** Talk therapy and medicine worked about the same for treating panic disorder in the short term. There was no clear winner between the two approaches.

- People improved similarly with both treatments
- Similar numbers of people stopped treatment early with both approaches
- No studies looked at long-term results (6 months or longer)

## Important limitations

The quality of evidence was low, so researchers cannot be completely certain about these results. There was also not enough information about side effects from medicines.","### Plain Language Summary

#### Purpose of Study
This study wanted to see how well two types of treatments work for adults with panic problems: talking therapy (psychological therapy) and medicine.

#### What Was Done
Researchers looked at 16 studies from around the world with a total of 966 people. They compared:
- Talking therapy
- Different kinds of medicine (like SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and others)

#### What They Found
- For most types of medicine, there wasn't a clear difference in how well they worked compared to talking therapy in the short term.
- Both treatments had similar numbers of people stopping the treatment for any reason.
- They didn't have information on how safe the treatments are (side effects) or how they compare for longer than six months.

#### Quality of Evidence
- The evidence was not very strong or clear.
- It's uncertain if one treatment is better because the data quality was low.
  
#### Suggestions for Future Research
- Future studies should look at how these treatments work over a longer time.
- They should also check for any hidden biases in the research methods."
"Background
Sedation reduces patient levels of anxiety and stress, facilitates the delivery of care and ensures safety. Alpha‐2 agonists have a range of effects including sedation, analgesia and antianxiety. They sedate, but allow staff to interact with patients and do not suppress respiration. They are attractive alternatives for long‐term sedation during mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients. 
Objectives
To assess the safety and efficacy of alpha‐2 agonists for sedation of more than 24 hours, compared with traditional sedatives, in mechanically‐ventilated critically ill patients. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 10, 2014), MEDLINE (1946 to 9 October 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 9 October 2014), CINAHL (1982 to 9 October 2014), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (1982 to 9 October 2014), ISI Web of Science (1987 to 9 October 2014), Chinese Biological Medical Database (1978 to 9 October 2014) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (1979 to 9 October 2014), the World Health Organization international clinical trials registry platform (to 9 October 2014), Current Controlled Trials metaRegister of controlled trials active registers (to 9 October 2014), the ClinicalTrials.gov database (to 9 October 2014), the conference proceedings citation index (to 9 October 2014) and the reference lists of included studies and previously published meta‐analyses and systematic reviews for relevant studies. We imposed no language restriction. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials comparing alpha‐2 agonists (clonidine or dexmedetomidine) versus alternative sedatives for long‐term sedation (more than 24 hours) during mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We performed meta‐analyses when more than three studies were included, and selected a random‐effects model due to expected clinical heterogeneity. We calculated the geometric mean difference for continuous outcomes and the risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes. We described the effects by values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We considered two‐sided P < 0.05 to be statistically significant. 
Main results
Seven studies, covering 1624 participants, met the inclusion criteria. All included studies investigated adults and compared dexmedetomidine with traditional sedatives, including propofol, midazolam and lorazepam. Compared with traditional sedatives, dexmedetomidine reduced the geometric mean duration of mechanical ventilation by 22% (95% CI 10% to 33%; four studies, 1120 participants, low quality evidence), and consequently the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) by 14% (95% CI 1% to 24%; five studies, 1223 participants, very low quality evidence). There was no evidence that dexmedetomidine decreased the risk of delirium (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.14; seven studies, 1624 participants, very low quality evidence) as results were consistent with both no effect and appreciable benefit. Only one study assessed the risk of coma, but lacked methodological reliability (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.86, very low quality evidence). Of all the adverse events included, the most commonly reported one was bradycardia, and we observed a doubled (111%) increase in the incidence of bradycardia (RR 2.11; 95% CI 1.39 to 3.20; six studies, 1587 participants, very low quality evidence). Our meta‐analysis provided no evidence that dexmedetomidine had any impact on mortality (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.24; six studies, 1584 participants, very low quality evidence). We observed high levels of heterogeneity in risk of delirium (I² = 70%), but due to the limited number of studies we were unable to determine the source of heterogeneity through subgroup analyses or meta‐regression. We judged six of the seven studies to be at high risk of bias. 
Authors' conclusions
In this review, we found no eligible studies for children or for clonidine. Compared with traditional sedatives, long‐term sedation using dexmedetomidine in critically ill adults reduced the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay. There was no evidence for a beneficial effect on risk of delirium and the heterogeneity was high. The evidence for risk of coma was inadequate. The most common adverse event was bradycardia. No evidence indicated that dexmedetomidine changed mortality. The general quality of evidence ranged from very low to low, due to high risks of bias, serious inconsistency and imprecision, and strongly suspected publication bias. Future studies could pay more attention to children and to using clonidine.","Dexmedetomidine and clonidine for long‐term sedation during mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine and clonidine (known as alpha‐2 agonists) for long‐term sedation during mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). 
Background 
Sedation is an important treatment for critically ill patients who need a machine to support breathing, because it reduces anxiety and stress and facilitates the delivery of nursing care. However, some commonly‐used sedatives, such as propofol, midazolam and lorazepam, might decrease blood pressure, depress breathing, and delay awakening after a long‐term infusion. They may prolong breathing support time and length of stay in hospital. Dexmedetomidine and clonidine sedate but allow staff to interact with patients, and they ease pain but do not depress breathing. Those treated with them could be more easy to awake, and more able to communicate their discomfort and pain. These drugs are therefore attractive alternatives for long‐term sedation, and we planned to assess their efficacy and safety for long‐term (more than 24 hours) sedation, compared with traditional sedatives. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the databases until October 2014. We included seven randomized controlled trials, with a total of 1624 participants, comparing dexmedetomidine versus traditional sedatives. All the studies required participants to have an anticipated need for sedation of more than 24 hours. The alternative sedatives included propofol, midazolam and lorazepam. We found no eligible studies in children or for clonidine. Of the seven studies, six were funded by the drug manufacturer, and one did not state any conflict of interest. 
Key results 
Compared with traditional sedatives, dexmedetomidine reduced the breathing support time by approximately one‐fifth, and the length of stay time in ICU by one‐seventh. Dexmedetomidine was at least as effective as traditional sedatives for producing sedation and maintaining a light sedation level. There was no clear evidence in support of dexmedetomidine reducing the risk of delirium (a kind of acute confusion state), as results were consistent with both no effect and appreciable benefit. We had insufficient information to draw conclusions about reducing the risk of coma. Dexmedetomidine doubled the incidence of slow heartbeat, which was the most commonly reported adverse event. Our review provides no evidence that dexmedetomidine changed the overall death rate. 
Quality of the evidence 
The general quality of evidence ranged from very low to low, as most of the studies were at high risk of bias, serious inconsistency and imprecision, or strongly suspected publication bias.","# Plain Language Summary: Alpha-2 Agonists for Sedation in Critically Ill Patients

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether a type of medicine called alpha-2 agonists is safe and works well for keeping patients calm and sedated (asleep) for more than 24 hours while they are on breathing machines in the intensive care unit (ICU).

## Why does this matter?

When patients are very sick and need a breathing machine to help them breathe, doctors give them medicine to keep them calm and reduce their anxiety. Alpha-2 agonists are a newer type of calming medicine that may be better than older medicines because they help patients relax without stopping them from breathing on their own.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at 7 studies involving 1,624 adult patients. All studies compared a newer medicine called dexmedetomidine with older calming medicines like propofol and midazolam.

## What did they find?

**Good news:**
- Patients on dexmedetomidine needed the breathing machine for about 22% less time
- Patients stayed in the ICU about 14% less long

**Mixed or unclear results:**
- Dexmedetomidine did not clearly prevent confusion (delirium)
- It did not change how many patients survived

**Bad news:**
- Dexmedetomidine doubled the risk of a slow heart rate (bradycardia), which is a side effect

## Bottom line

Dexmedetomidine may help patients get off breathing machines faster and leave the ICU sooner, but it can cause a slower heart rate. More research is needed, especially in children.","### Plain Language Summary

**Background:**
When people are very sick and need machines to help them breathe, doctors often give them medicines to help them relax. These medicines help reduce stress and make it easier to take care of them. A type of medicine called alpha-2 agonists can help with relaxation and pain and are being looked at as alternatives to other sedatives for people on breathing machines.

**Objective:**
The goal of this study was to see how safe and effective alpha-2 agonists are compared to other sedatives for patients who need long-term help from breathing machines.

**Methods:**
Researchers looked at many studies to find information about how well these medicines work and how safe they are. They included studies where adults used alpha-2 agonists, like dexmedetomidine, and compared them to more traditional sedatives.

**Key Findings:**
- **Reduced Ventilation Time:** People using dexmedetomidine spent 22% less time on breathing machines compared to other sedatives.
- **Shorter ICU Stay:** These patients also had a 14% shorter stay in the intensive care unit (ICU).
- **No Clear Benefit for Delirium:** There was no strong evidence that dexmedetomidine lowered the risk of confusion (delirium).
- **Risk of Coma Unclear:** Only one study looked at the risk of coma, but the results were not very reliable.
- **Side Effect - Bradycardia:** The most common side effect was slow heartbeat, known as bradycardia, which happened more often with dexmedetomidine.
- **No Change in Death Rates:** There was no proof that dexmedetomidine affected survival rates.

**Conclusions:**
Dexmedetomidine may help reduce the time patients need help from machines and shorten their ICU stay, but it doesn't seem to affect confusion or death rates. The most common side effect was a slower heartbeat. The overall quality of evidence was low because of possible study errors. Future research could focus more on children and using another alpha-2 agonist, clonidine."
"Background
Human milk is the best enteral nutrition for preterm infants. However, human milk, given at standard recommended volumes, is not adequate to meet the protein, energy, and other nutrient requirements of preterm or low birth weight infants. One strategy that may be used to address the potential nutrient deficits is to give a higher volume of enteral feeds. High volume feeds may improve nutrient accretion and growth, and in turn may improve neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, there are concerns that high volume feeds may cause feed intolerance, necrotising enterocolitis, or complications related to fluid overload such as patent ductus arteriosus and chronic lung disease. 
This is an update of a review published in 2017.
Objectives
To assess the effect on growth and safety of high versus standard volume enteral feeds in preterm or low birth weight infants. In infants who were fed fortified human milk or preterm formula, high and standard volume feeds were defined as > 180 mL/kg/day and ≤ 180 mL/kg/day, respectively. In infants who were fed unfortified human milk or term formula, high and standard volume feeds were defined as > 200 mL/kg/day and ≤ 200 mL/kg/day, respectively. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020 Issue 6) in the Cochrane Library; Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to June 2020); Embase (1974 to June 2020); and CINAHL (inception to June 2020); Maternity & Infant Care Database (MIDIRS) (1971 to April 2020); as well as previous reviews, and trial registries. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared high versus standard volume enteral feeds for preterm or low birth weight infants. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and independently extracted data. We analysed treatment effects in individual trials and reported risk ratio (RR) and risk difference for dichotomous data, and mean difference (MD) for continuous data, with respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. The primary outcomes were weight gain, linear and head growth during hospital stay, and extrauterine growth restriction at discharge. 
Main results
We included two new RCTs (283 infants) in this update. In total, we included three trials (347 infants) in this updated review. 
High versus standard volume feeds with fortified human milk or preterm formula 
Two trials (283 infants) met the inclusion criteria for this comparison. Both were of good methodological quality, except for lack of masking. Both trials were performed in infants born at < 32 weeks' gestation. Meta‐analysis of data from both trials showed high volume feeds probably improves weight gain during hospital stay (MD 2.58 g/kg/day, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.76; participants = 271; moderate‐certainty evidence). High volume feeds may have little or no effect on linear growth (MD 0.05 cm/week, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.13; participants = 271; low‐certainty evidence), head growth (MD 0.02 cm/week, 95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.09; participants = 271; low‐certainty evidence), and extrauterine growth restriction at discharge (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.02; participants = 271; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of high volume feeds with fortified human milk or preterm formula on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.12 to 4.51; participants = 283; very‐low certainty evidence). 
High versus standard volume feeds with unfortified human milk or term formula 
One trial with 64 very low birth weight infants met the inclusion criteria for this comparison. This trial was unmasked but otherwise of good methodological quality. High volume feeds probably improves weight gain during hospital stay (MD 6.2 g/kg/day, 95% CI 2.71 to 9.69; participants = 61; moderate‐certainty evidence). The trial did not provide data on linear and head growth, and extrauterine growth restriction at discharge. We are uncertain as to the effect of high volume feeds with unfortified human milk or term formula on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.78; participants = 61; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
High volume feeds (≥ 180 mL/kg/day of fortified human milk or preterm formula, or ≥ 200 mL/kg/day of unfortified human milk or term formula) probably improves weight gain during hospital stay. The available data is inadequate to draw conclusions on the effect of high volume feeds on other growth and clinical outcomes. A large RCT is needed to provide data of sufficient quality and precision to inform policy and practice.","High versus standard volume feeds to promote growth in preterm or low birth weight infants 
Review question Does giving preterm (born at < 37 weeks) or low birth weight (< 2500 grams) infants a greater volume of feeds than is usually given, promote growth without causing feeding problems or other side effects? 
BackgroundInfants born early (preterm) need extra nutrients for growth. One way to deliver extra nutrition is to give infants a greater volume of feeds than usual (high volume feeds, equal to or greater than 180 to 200 mL/kg/day of milk). Although giving high volumes of milk to preterm or low birth weight infants might increase growth rates, there are concerns that infants may not tolerate high volume feeds and may experience side effects including severe bowel problems. We have looked for evidence from clinical trials that assessed whether high volume feeds are beneficial or harmful for preterm or low birth weight infants. 
Study characteristicsSearch is up‐to‐date as of June 2020. We found three studies that addressed this question. 
Key resultsEvidence from two studies showed that high volume feeds (≥ 180 mL/kg/day) with fortified human milk (human milk with added human milk fortifier) or preterm formula probably improves weight gain during hospital stay, when compared to standard volume of the same. Similarly, evidence from one small study showed that high volume feeds (≥ 200 mL/kg/day) with unfortified human milk or preterm formula probably improves weight gain during hospital stay. The evidence is insufficient to comment on the effect of high volume feeds on increase in length or head size during hospital stay, long‐term growth and development, and the effect on gut problems or other side effects. 
Conclusions 
High volume feeds probably improve weight gain during hospital stay. The available data is inadequate to draw conclusions on the effect of high volume feeds on other growth and clinical outcomes.","# Plain Language Summary: High Volume Feeding for Premature Babies

## What is this study about?

This study looks at whether giving premature or low birth weight babies larger amounts of milk feeds helps them grow better and stay healthy.

## Why does this matter?

Breast milk is the best food for premature babies. However, the normal amount of breast milk doesn't always give these babies all the nutrients they need to grow properly. Doctors wondered if giving babies more milk would help them gain weight and develop better. But they worried that too much milk might cause stomach problems or other health issues.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at three studies that compared two groups of premature babies:
- **Group 1:** Babies who got larger amounts of milk feeds
- **Group 2:** Babies who got standard (normal) amounts of milk feeds

The babies in these studies were born very early (before 32 weeks of pregnancy).

## What did they find?

**Weight gain:** Babies who got larger amounts of milk gained more weight while in the hospital. This was the clearest finding.

**Other growth:** There was little to no difference between the two groups in how much babies grew in length or head size.

**Safety:** Researchers couldn't find enough information to say whether high volume feeding caused stomach problems like necrotizing enterocolitis (a serious intestinal condition).

## What does this mean?

Giving premature babies larger amounts of milk probably helps them gain weight. However, doctors need more research to understand if this helps with other types of growth and to make sure it's completely safe.","### Plain Language Summary

**Background:**
This study looks at feeding preterm or low birth weight babies. Human milk is the best, but sometimes it doesn’t have enough nutrients for these babies. Giving more milk might help them grow better, but there are worries it could cause problems like upset stomachs or lung issues. This study updates one from 2017.

**Objective:**
The study wants to find out if giving more milk helps babies grow better and if it’s safe. They compared babies who got different amounts of milk: more than 180 or 200 mL/kg/day versus 180 or 200 mL/kg/day or less, depending on the type of milk.

**Methods:**
Researchers looked at past studies and found new ones. They included studies where babies were randomly given different amounts of milk to compare the effects.

**Key Outcomes:**
- **Weight Gain:** Babies who got more milk gained more weight in the hospital.
- **Growth Measurements:** There wasn’t much change in how long or big their heads grew.
- **Safety:** It’s unclear if more milk affected risks of certain stomach problems.

**Results:**
- For babies on special or fortified milk, getting more milk likely helped them gain more weight.
- For babies on regular milk, more milk also helped with weight gain, but other growth details weren’t studied.
- Safety concerns need more research because current data isn’t clear.

**Conclusions:**
Giving more milk can help babies gain weight in the hospital, but there isn’t enough information on other benefits or risks. Bigger and better studies are needed to understand all effects and help make feeding decisions for these babies."
"Background
Fertility problems are very common, as subfertility affects about 10% to 15% of couples trying to conceive. There are many factors that may impact a couple's ability to conceive and one of these may be incorrect timing of intercourse. Conception is only possible from approximately five days before up to several hours after ovulation. Therefore, to be effective, intercourse must take place during this fertile period. 'Timed intercourse' is the practice of prospectively identifying ovulation and, thus, the fertile period to increase the likelihood of conception. Whilst timed intercourse may increase conception rates and reduce unnecessary intervention and costs, there may be associated adverse aspects including time consumption and stress. Ovulation prediction methods used for timing intercourse include urinary hormone measurement (luteinizing hormone (LH), estrogen), tracking basal body temperatures, cervical mucus investigation, calendar charting and ultrasonography. This review considered the evidence from randomised controlled trials for the use of timed intercourse on positive pregnancy outcomes. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and risks of ovulation prediction methods for timing intercourse on conception in couples trying to conceive. 
Search methods
We searched the following sources to identify relevant randomised controlled trials, the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, LILACS, Web of Knowledge, the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Register Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. Furthermore, we manually searched the references of relevant articles. The search was not restricted by language or publication status. The last search was on 5 August 2014. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction or comparing different methods of ovulation prediction for timing intercourse against each other in couples trying to conceive. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and extracted the data. The primary review outcomes were cumulative live birth and adverse events (such as quality of life, depression and stress). Secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, pregnancy (clinical or self‐reported pregnancy, not yet confirmed by ultrasound) and time to conception. We combined data to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for the main comparisons using GRADE methods. 
Main results
We included five RCTs (2840 women or couples) comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction. Unfortunately one large study (n = 1453) reporting live birth and pregnancy had not published outcome data by randomised group and therefore could not be analysed. Consequently, four RCTs (n = 1387) were included in the meta‐analysis. The evidence was of low to very low quality. Main limitations for downgrading the evidence included imprecision, lack of reporting clinically relevant outcomes and the high risk of publication bias. 
One study reported live birth, but the sample size was too small to draw any relevant conclusions on the effect of timed intercourse (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.41, 1 RCT, n = 17, very low quality). One study reported stress as an adverse event. There was no evidence of a difference in levels of stress (mean difference 1.98, 95 CI% ‐0.87 to 4.83, 1 RCT, n = 77, low level evidence). No other studies reported adverse events. Two studies reported clinical pregnancy. There was no evidence of a difference in clinical pregnancy rates (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.12, 2 RCTs, n = 177, I2 = 0%, low level evidence). This suggested that if the chance of a clinical pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction is assumed to be 16%, the chance of success following timed intercourse would be between 9% and 33%.Four studies reported pregnancy rate (clinical or self‐reported pregnancy). Timed intercourse was associated with higher pregnancy rates compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction in couples trying to conceive (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.71, 4 RCTs, n = 1387, I2 = 0%, very low level evidence). This suggests that if the chance of a pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction is assumed to be 13%, the chance following timed intercourse would be between 14% and 23%. Subgroup analysis by duration of subfertility showed no difference in effect between couples trying to conceive for < 12 months versus couples trying for ≥ 12 months. One trial reported time to conception data and showed no evidence of a difference in time to conception. 
Authors' conclusions
There are insufficient data available to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of timed intercourse for the outcomes of live birth, adverse events and clinical pregnancy. Timed intercourse may improve pregnancy rates (clinical or self‐reported pregnancy, not yet confirmed by ultrasound) compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction. The quality of this evidence is low to very low and therefore findings should be regarded with caution. There is a high risk of publication bias, as one large study remains unpublished 8 years after recruitment finished. Further research is required, reporting clinically relevant outcomes (live birth, clinical pregnancy rates and adverse effects), to determine if timed intercourse is safe and effective in couples trying to conceive.","Timed intercourse for couples with subfertility
Review question 
Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the effect of timed intercourse versus spontaneous intercourse in couples trying to conceive. 
Background 
Many couples find it difficult to achieve a pregnancy and have concerns about their fertility. Each cycle, a woman is fertile from approximately five days before ovulation until several hours after ovulation, due to limited survival times of the sperm and egg. Therefore, prospectively identifying this fertile period of a woman's menstrual cycle, to guide timing of intercourse, may improve conception rates. This may reduce unnecessary medical treatment and costs of advanced infertility treatment, but could also cause adverse events such as stress. The fertile period can be identified by different methods including urinary fertility monitoring, calendar charting, observing changes in cervical mucous and basal body temperatures or follicular maturation on ultrasound. The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and risks of timed intercourse on pregnancy outcomes in couples trying to conceive. 
Study characteristics 
We found five randomised controlled trials comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction, in a total of 2840 women or couples trying to conceive. The evidence was current to August 2014. 
Key results 
One large included study (1453 women) has not published usable results and could therefore not be analysed. One study reported live birth rates and found no evidence of a difference; however, the study was too small to have any clinical value. Only one study reported levels of stress and showed no evidence of a difference between timed intercourse with urinary fertility monitoring and intercourse without urinary fertility monitoring. No other adverse events were reported. Only two studies reported clinical pregnancy rates, and showed no evidence of a difference in pregnancy rates in couples with subfertility. The evidence suggested that if the chance of a clinical pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction was assumed to be 16%, the chance of a clinical pregnancy following timed intercourse would be between 9% and 33%. However, if including self‐reported pregnancies (not confirmed by ultrasound), pregnancy rates were higher after timed intercourse. The evidence suggested that if the chance of a pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction was 13%, the chance following timed intercourse would be between 14% and 23%. 
No difference in effect was found between couples trying to conceive for less than 12 months versus 12 months or more. One trial reported time to conception data and showed no evidence of a difference in time to conception. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low for all outcomes. The main limitations of the evidence were imprecision, poor reporting of clinically relevant outcomes and a high risk of publication bias, as one large study remains unpublished. Therefore, the findings should be regarded with caution.","# Plain Language Summary: Timed Intercourse for Couples Trying to Conceive

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether timing intercourse around ovulation (when an egg is released) helps couples get pregnant. Ovulation only happens once per month, and pregnancy is only possible for a few days around that time.

## Why is this important?

About 1 in 10 couples have trouble getting pregnant. One way couples try to improve their chances is by timing intercourse during the fertile window—the days when pregnancy is possible. Different methods can help predict ovulation, such as:
- Urine tests that measure hormones
- Tracking body temperature
- Checking cervical mucus
- Using ultrasound

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for studies that compared:
- Couples using ovulation prediction methods versus couples not using them
- Different ovulation prediction methods against each other

They found 5 studies with about 2,840 women or couples total.

## What did they find?

**Pregnancy rates:** Timed intercourse showed a slight increase in pregnancy rates compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction. However, the evidence was weak.

**Live births:** Only one very small study reported actual live births, so researchers couldn't draw solid conclusions.

**Stress and side effects:** Most studies didn't measure stress or other negative effects. One study found no difference in stress levels between groups.

**Time to get pregnant:** Only one study looked at this and found no difference.

## What does this mean?

There isn't enough strong evidence to say for sure whether timed intercourse helps couples get pregnant. More research is needed, especially studies that track whether couples actually have babies and whether timed intercourse causes stress or other problems.","### Plain Language Summary: Study on Timing Intercourse for Couples Trying to Have a Baby

**Background**

Having trouble getting pregnant is common, affecting about 10% to 15% of couples. One reason might be not knowing the right time to try. Women can only get pregnant during a few days each month around ovulation. ""Timed intercourse"" means figuring out when this time is and trying to conceive then. While this might help, it can also be time-consuming and stressful. There are different ways to predict ovulation, like checking hormone levels or tracking body temperature.

**Objective**

The study wanted to see if timing intercourse helps couples get pregnant and if there are any risks involved.

**Methods**

The researchers looked at several big health databases for studies comparing timed intercourse with not timing it. They focused on random trials, where couples were randomly assigned to use or not use timed intercourse. These studies were about couples trying to have a baby, and involved data collection up to August 2014.

**Who Was Studied**

The research included data from five trials involving 2,840 women or couples. Four of these trials, with 1,387 participants, provided data for the main analysis.

**What They Found**

- **Live Births and Pregnancies:** Only one study with a small number of people reported live birth results, but the results weren’t clear enough to make firm conclusions.
  
- **Stress Levels:** One study looked at stress and found no clear difference for couples using timed intercourse.

- **Pregnancy Rates:** Timed intercourse might slightly improve pregnancy rates compared to not timing intercourse, but the evidence is weak.

**Conclusions**

Overall, the information wasn’t strong enough to say for sure if timed intercourse is better for having a baby. There might be a small increase in pregnancy rates, but more research is needed to be sure and to see if there are any negative effects. More studies are necessary to help couples make informed decisions."
"Background
Pressure ulcers, which are a localised injury to the skin, or underlying tissue, or both, occur when people are unable to reposition themselves to relieve pressure on bony prominences. Pressure ulcers are often difficult to heal, painful, expensive to manage and have a negative impact on quality of life. While individual patient safety and quality care stem largely from direct healthcare practitioner‐patient interactions, each practitioner‐patient wound‐care contact may be constrained or enhanced by healthcare organisation of services. Research is needed to demonstrate clearly the effect of different provider‐orientated approaches to pressure ulcer prevention and treatment. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different provider‐orientated interventions targeted at the organisation of health services, on the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers. 
Search methods
In April 2018 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched three clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, non‐RCTs, controlled before‐and‐after studies and interrupted time series, which enrolled people at risk of, or people with existing pressure ulcers, were eligible for inclusion in the review. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment, data extraction and GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
The search yielded a total of 3172 citations and, following screening and application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we deemed four studies eligible for inclusion. These studies reported the primary outcome of pressure ulcer incidence or pressure ulcer healing, or both. 
One controlled before‐and‐after study explored the impact of transmural care (a care model that provided activities to support patients and their family/partners and activities to promote continuity of care), among 62 participants with spinal cord injury. It is unclear whether transmural care leads to a difference in pressure ulcer incidence compared with usual care (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 1.64; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). 
One RCT explored the impact of hospital‐in‐the‐home care, among 100 older adults. It is unclear whether hospital‐in‐the‐home care leads to a difference in pressure ulcer incidence risk compared with hospital admission (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.98; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). 
A third study (cluster‐randomised stepped‐wedge trial), explored the impact of being cared for by enhanced multidisciplinary teams (EMDT), among 161 long‐term‐care residents. The analyses of the primary outcome used measurements of 201 pressure ulcers from 119 residents. It is unclear if EMDT reduces the pressure ulcer incidence rate compared with usual care (hazard ratio (HR) 1.12, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.68; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). It is unclear whether there is a difference in the number of wounds healed (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.87; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). It is unclear whether there is a difference in the reduction in surface area, with and without EMDT, (healing rate 1.006; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.03; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). It is unclear if EMDT leads to a difference in time to complete healing (HR 1.48, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.78, very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). 
The final study (quasi‐experimental cluster trial), explored the impact of multidisciplinary wound care among 176 nursing home residents. It is unclear whether there is a difference in the number of pressure ulcers healed between multidisciplinary care, or usual care (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.42; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). It is unclear if this type of care leads to a difference in time to complete healing compared with usual care (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.50; very low‐certainty evidence; downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). 
In all studies the certainty of the evidence is very low due to high risk of bias and imprecision. We downgraded the evidence due to study limitations, which included selection and attrition bias, and sample size. Secondary outcomes, such as adverse events were not reported in all studies. Where they were reported it was unclear if there was a difference as the certainty of evidence was very low. 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence for the impact of organisation of health services for preventing and treating pressure ulcers remains unclear. Overall, GRADE assessments of the evidence resulted in judgements of very low‐certainty evidence. The studies were at high risk of bias, and outcome measures were imprecise due to wide confidence intervals and small sample sizes, meaning that additional research is required to confirm these results. The secondary outcomes reported varied across the studies and some were not reported. We judged the evidence from those that were reported (including adverse events), to be of very low certainty.","Organisation of health services for preventing and treating pressure ulcers
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this review was to find out whether the way in which health services are organised can affect prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found four relevant studies. 
Key messages 
We cannot be certain whether transmural care (a way of providing care that delivers activities to support patients and their family/partners, and activities to promote continuity of care), hospital‐in‐the‐home care, care provided by a team of different disciplines or care that is usually provided, make any difference to whether people develop pressure ulcers, how fast existing ulcers heal, or whether people with ulcers are admitted or readmitted to hospital. 
What was studied in the review? 
Pressure ulcers, sometimes known as bedsores or pressure sores, are injuries that develop as a result of continued pressure on bony parts of the body such as the hips, heels or lower back. It is thought that the way health services are organised can influence the development of pressure ulcers among people at risk, and may also influence the healing of these wounds. 
Care can be delivered to people with pressure ulcers in various ways. We wanted to find out whether different types of care delivery affected the number of people developing pressure ulcers and how fast existing ulcers healed. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found four studies dating from 1999 to 2014, that compared alternative types of care delivery to the way care is usually provided. The mean number of participants in the studies was 140, and the ages of participants ranged from 36.5 years to 83 years. In the studies 198 participants were men and 301 were women. All studies were funded by government agencies. Two studies focused on prevention of pressure ulcers, one on prevention and treatment, and one on treatment only. 
It is unclear whether any alternative type of care delivery is better than care that is usually provided at reducing risk of pressure ulcers, or improving pressure ulcer healing. It is also unclear whether the way healthcare services are organised improves quality of life, patient and staff satisfaction, reduces hospital admissions, emergency room visits, or death at 28 days. This is because we are very uncertain about the evidence in all studies. 
This Plain language summary is up to date as of 18 April 2018.","# Plain Language Summary: Health Service Organization for Pressure Ulcer Prevention and Treatment

## What is this study about?

Pressure ulcers are painful sores that develop on the skin when people cannot move around or change position regularly. They are hard to heal and costly to treat. This review looked at whether different ways of organizing healthcare services can help prevent or treat these sores better.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for studies that tested different healthcare approaches to prevent or treat pressure ulcers. They looked for studies comparing new care methods to regular care. They found 3,172 studies but only 4 met their requirements.

## Who was in the studies?

The four studies included:
- 62 people with spinal cord injuries
- 100 older adults
- 161 long-term care residents
- 176 nursing home residents

## What treatments were tested?

The studies tested four different healthcare approaches:

1. **Transmural care** – A model that helps patients and families stay connected and supports continuity of care
2. **Hospital-in-the-home care** – Receiving hospital-level care at home instead of in a hospital
3. **Enhanced multidisciplinary teams** – Specialized teams of different healthcare workers working together
4. **Multidisciplinary wound care** – Teams of different healthcare workers focused on wound treatment

## What were the results?

The results were unclear for all four approaches. The studies did not show strong evidence that any of these healthcare organization methods clearly prevented or healed pressure ulcers better than regular care.

## Why are the results unclear?

The studies had problems that made it hard to trust the results:
- Small numbers of participants
- Study design issues
- Wide ranges of possible outcomes

## What do researchers conclude?

More research is needed. Current evidence does not clearly show whether organizing healthcare services differently helps prevent or treat pressure ulcers.","### Plain Language Summary

#### What is this study about?

This study looks at different ways healthcare providers can organize their services to help prevent and treat pressure ulcers, which are injuries to the skin and underlying tissue. Pressure ulcers can be painful and hard to heal.

#### What did the researchers want to find out?

They wanted to see if different ways of organizing care for pressure ulcers could make a difference in preventing them or helping them heal.

#### How did they do the study?

Researchers looked at four different studies, involving people at risk of or with pressure ulcers. They checked different methods of care, like home-based care or special care teams, to see if there were any differences in how well the pressure ulcers were prevented or healed.

#### What did they find?

1. **Transmural Care**: A care model for people with spinal cord injuries; it was unclear if it helped more than usual care.
   
2. **Hospital-in-the-Home Care**: Tried with older adults, and it wasn't clear if it was better than regular hospital care.
   
3. **Enhanced Multidisciplinary Teams (EMDT)**: Used in long-term care; it was unclear if they reduced pressure ulcers or improved healing compared to usual care.
   
4. **Multidisciplinary Wound Care**: Used in nursing homes; it was unclear if it improved healing compared to regular care.

Overall, the studies showed uncertain results because there were issues like small study sizes.

#### What does this mean?

Right now, it's still unclear if organizing healthcare differently really helps with pressure ulcers. The studies had some problems, so more research is needed to find better answers.

#### Is it safe?

The studies didn't report clearly on safety, so we don't know much about side effects or problems from these care methods.

In conclusion, more research is needed to understand how different healthcare approaches can help with pressure ulcers."
"Background
A dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) procedure aims to restore drainage of tears by bypassing a blockage in the nasolacrimal duct, through the creation of a bony ostium that allows communication between the lacrimal sac and the nasal cavity. It can be performed using endonasal or external approaches. The comparative success rates of these two approaches have not yet been established and this review aims to evaluate the relevant up‐to‐date research. 
Objectives
The primary aim of this review is to compare the success rates of endonasal DCR with that of external DCR. The secondary aim is to compare the complication rates between the two procedures. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2016, Issue 8), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to 22 August 2016), Embase (January 1980 to 22 August 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to 22 August 2016), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐ Science (CPCI‐S) (January 1990 to 22 August 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 22 August 2016. We requested or examined relevant conference proceedings for appropriate trials. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing endonasal and external DCRs. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and extracted data on reported outcomes. We attempted to contact investigators to clarify the methodological quality of the studies. We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included two trials in this review. One trial from Finland compared laser‐assisted endonasal DCR with external DCR, and one trial from India compared mechanical endonasal DCR (using punch forceps) with external DCR. The trials were poorly reported and it was difficult to judge the extent to which bias had been avoided. 
Anatomic success was defined as the demonstration of a patent lacrimal passage on syringing, or endoscopic visualisation of fluorescein dye at the nasal opening of the anastomoses after a period of at least six months following surgery. Subjective success was defined as the resolution of symptoms of watering following surgery after a period of at least six months. Both included trials used anatomic patency demonstrated by irrigation as a measure of anatomic success. Different effects were seen in these two trials (I2 = 76%). People receiving laser‐assisted endonasal DCR were less likely to have a successful operation compared with external DCR (63% versus 91%; risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.52 to 0.92; 64 participants). There was little or no difference in success comparing mechanical endonasal DCR and external DCR (90% in both groups; RR 1.00, CI 0.81 to 1.23; 40 participants). We judged this evidence on success to be very low‐certainty, downgrading for risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency. The trial from Finland also assessed subjective improvement in symptoms following surgery. Resolution of symptoms of watering in outdoor conditions was reported by 84% of the participants in the external DCR group and 59% of those in the laser‐assisted endonasal DCR group (RR 0.70, CI 0.51 to 0.97; 64 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
There were no cases of intraoperative bleeding in any participant in the trial that compared laser‐assisted endonasal DCR to external DCR. This was in contrast to the trial comparing mechanical endonasal DCR to external DCR in which 45% of participants in both groups experienced intraoperative bleeding (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.98; 40 participants). We judged this evidence on intraoperative bleeding to be very low‐certainty, downgrading for risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency. 
There were only two cases of postoperative bleeding, both in the external DCR group (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.10; participants = 104; studies = 2). There were only two cases of wound infection/gaping, again both in the external DCR group (RR 0.20, CI 0.01 to 3.92; participants = 40; studies = 1). We judged this evidence on complications to be very low‐certainty, downgrading one level for risk of bias and two levels for imprecision due to the very low number of cases. 
Authors' conclusions
There is uncertainty as to the relative effects of endonasal and external DCR. Differences in effect seen in the two trials included in this review may be due to variations in the endonasal technique, but may also be due to other differences between the trials. Future larger RCTs are required to further assess the success and complication rates of endonasal and external DCR. Different techniques of endonasal DCR should also be assessed, as the choice of endonasal technique can influence the outcome. Strict outcome criteria should be adopted to assess functional and anatomical outcomes with a minimal follow‐up of six months.","Different surgical techniques for treating blockage of the tear duct
What is the aim of this review?  The aim of this Cochrane Review was to compare two different surgical techniques for treating blockage of the tear (nasolacrimal) duct. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found two studies. 
Key messages  It is unclear whether or not endonasal dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a better way of treating tear duct obstruction than external DCR (very low‐certainty evidence), nor is it clear whether endonasal DCR reduces the chance of complications such as bleeding or wound infection (very low‐certainty evidence). 
What was studied in the review?  The tear duct, or nasolacrimal passage, allows excess tears to drain away from the eye. If the tear duct gets blocked then the eye can water too much. Doctors can use a surgical procedure known as dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) to treat the blocked tear duct. This operation creates a way for the tears to drain from the eye that bypasses the blockage. There are two ways of doing this operation: either by making a cut on the outside of the nose (external DCR); or by operating inside the nose, using an endoscope (a flexible tube with a light at the end) to see inside the nose (endonasal DCR) and creating an alternate drainage pathway using instruments (such as forceps or drill) or laser. 
What are the main results of the review?  The review authors found two relevant studies. One study was from Finland and compared laser‐assisted endonasal DCR with external DCR. One study was from India and compared mechanical endonasal DCR (using punch forceps) with external DCR. 
The Cochrane researchers are uncertain whether endonasal DCR increases the chance of success compared with external DCR, or whether endonasal DCR reduces the chance of complications such as bleeding or wound infection. They judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?  The Cochrane researchers searched for studies that had been published up to 22 August 2016.","# Plain Language Summary: Tear Duct Surgery Comparison

## What is this study about?

This study compares two different surgical approaches to fix blocked tear ducts. When tear ducts become blocked, tears cannot drain properly, causing watery eyes. Doctors can fix this with surgery by creating a new drainage pathway around the blockage.

## The two surgical approaches

**External DCR:** The surgeon makes a cut on the outside of the face near the nose to create the new drainage pathway.

**Endonasal DCR:** The surgeon works through the nose (no cut on the face) to create the new drainage pathway. Two different methods were tested:
- Using a laser
- Using special forceps (grabbing tools)

## What did researchers want to find out?

The main questions were:
1. Which approach works better?
2. Which approach has fewer complications (problems)?

## What did they find?

Researchers reviewed two studies comparing these surgeries:

**Success rates:**
- **Laser through the nose vs. external surgery:** External surgery worked better (91% success vs. 63% success)
- **Forceps through the nose vs. external surgery:** Both worked about the same (90% success in both)

**Complications:**
- Very few serious problems occurred in either approach
- A small amount of bleeding during surgery was more common with the forceps method

## Important notes

The studies were small and had some quality issues, so the results are not completely certain. Researchers say we need bigger, better-designed studies to know for sure which approach is best.","**Plain Language Summary**

This study looks at two ways to fix tear duct problems through surgery called dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR). The tear duct helps drain tears from the eyes to the nose. Sometimes it gets blocked, and this surgery helps clear the way. There are two types of DCR: endonasal and external. This study compares how well each type works and their side effects.

**Purpose of the Study**
The main goal is to see which surgery method is better at clearing the blockage. The study also checks if one method causes fewer problems than the other.

**Who is Involved**
The study looked at trials from Finland and India, including about 104 people in total.

**What Happens in the Study**
The researchers collected information from medical databases and selected trials that met certain criteria. They compared the results of two types of DCR surgeries, one using a laser and one using a mechanical tool, to the traditional external method.

**Key Findings**
- For surgery success, the laser endonasal method was less successful (63%) compared to the external method (91%).
- The mechanical endonasal and external methods had similar success rates (90% for both).
- When it came to symptom relief outdoors, more people felt better with the external method than the laser endonasal method.
- There was no bleeding during the laser endonasal surgeries, but some bleeding occurred with both methods in the mechanical endonasal trial.
- Very few people experienced bleeding or infection after surgery, mostly in the external group.

**Safety and Issues**
The evidence on safety, like bleeding and infections, was not very strong. More studies are needed to understand which method is safer and works best.

**Overall Conclusion**
It's still unclear which DCR method is better. More extensive studies should be conducted. Different endonasal techniques should be explored because they might affect the outcomes. Future research should have strict criteria and at least six months of follow-up."
"Background
Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) is the second most common entrapment neuropathy after carpal tunnel syndrome. Treatment may be conservative or surgical, but optimal management remains controversial. This is an update of a review first published in 2010 and previously updated in 2012. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of conservative and surgical treatment in ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE). We intended to test whether: 
‐ surgical treatment is effective in reducing symptoms and signs and in increasing nerve function; 
‐ conservative treatment is effective in reducing symptoms and signs and in increasing nerve function; 
‐ it is possible to identify the best treatment on the basis of clinical, neurophysiological, or nerve imaging assessment. 
Search methods
On 31 May 2016 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL Plus, and LILACS. We also searched PEDro (14 October 2016), and the papers cited in relevant reviews. On 4 July 2016 we searched trials registries for ongoing or unpublished trials. 
Selection criteria
The review included only randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs evaluating people with clinical symptoms suggesting the presence of UNE. We included trials evaluating all forms of surgical and conservative treatments. We considered studies regarding therapy of UNE with or without neurophysiological evidence of entrapment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts of references retrieved from the searches and selected all potentially relevant studies. The review authors independently extracted data from included trials and assessed trial quality. We contacted trial investigators for any missing information. 
Main results
We identified nine RCTs (587 participants) for inclusion in the review, of which three studies were found at this update. The sequence generation was inadequate in one study and not described in three studies. We performed two meta‐analyses to evaluate the clinical (3 trials, 261 participants) and neurophysiological (2 trials, 101 participants) outcomes of simple decompression versus decompression with submuscular or subcutaneous transposition; four trials in total examined this comparison. 
We found no difference between simple decompression and transposition of the ulnar nerve for both clinical improvement (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.08; moderate‐quality evidence) and neurophysiological improvement (mean difference (in m/s) 1.47, 95% CI ‐0.94 to 3.87). The number of participants to clinically improve was 91 out of 131 in the simple decompression group and 97 out of 130 in the transposition group. Transposition showed a higher number of wound infections (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.85; moderate‐quality evidence). 
In one trial (47 participants), the authors compared medial epicondylectomy with anterior transposition and found no difference in clinical and neurophysiological outcomes. 
In one trial (48 participants), the investigators compared subcutaneous transposition with submuscular transposition and found no difference in clinical outcomes. 
In one trial (54 participants for 56 nerves treated), the authors found no difference between endoscopic and open decompression in improving clinical function. 
One trial (51 participants) assessed conservative treatment in clinically mild or moderate UNE. Based on low‐quality evidence, the trial authors found that information on avoiding prolonged movements or positions was effective in improving subjective discomfort. Night splinting and nerve gliding exercises in addition to information provision did not result in further improvement. 
One trial (55 participants) assessed the effectiveness of corticosteroid injection and found no difference versus placebo in improving symptoms at three months' follow‐up. 
Authors' conclusions
We found only two studies of treatment of ulnar neuropathy using conservative treatment as the comparator. The available comparative treatment evidence is not sufficient to support a multiple treatment meta‐analysis to identify the best treatment for idiopathic UNE on the basis of clinical, neurophysiological, and imaging characteristics. We do not know when to treat a person with this condition conservatively or surgically. Moderate‐quality evidence indicates that simple decompression and decompression with transposition are equally effective in idiopathic UNE, including when the nerve impairment is severe. Decompression with transposition is associated with more deep and superficial wound infections than simple decompression, also based on moderate‐quality evidence. People undergoing endoscopic surgery were more likely to have a haematoma. Evidence from one small RCT of conservative treatment showed that in mild cases, information on movements or positions to avoid may reduce subjective discomfort.","Treatment for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE)
Review question 
What are the effects of treatments for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE)?
Background 
Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow is the second most common type of condition in which a nerve becomes trapped or compressed (the most common affects the wrist). The ulnar nerve travels down the side of the elbow. This nerve is important for movement and the sense of touch in the hand at the little finger side. Symptoms of UNE are tingling of the fourth and fifth finger at night, pain at the elbow, and a change in sense of touch if the elbow is bent for a long time. When UNE is severe, some hand muscles can become weak. Diagnosis is by the symptoms and signs of the condition, as well as neurophysiological tests. Treatment of UNE can be surgical or nonsurgical (e.g. splints, physical therapy, and rehabilitation). The best way to treat UNE remains unclear. 
Study characteristics 
We found two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of nonsurgical treatment. One RCT compared three groups of people with mild or moderate UNE (51 people in total). All three groups received written instructions to avoid movements or positions that provoked symptoms. The second group had the same information with elbow splints at night for three months. The third group had the same information with nerve gliding exercises. The other nonsurgical study (55 people) compared a corticosteroid injection with a sham injection. 
Seven RCTs compared different surgical methods:
• simple decompression or transposition of the nerve (submuscular or subcutaneous transposition) (4 trials, 327 participants); 
• medial epicondylectomy or anterior transposition (1 trial, 47 participants);
• anterior subcutaneous transposition or anterior submuscular transposition (1 trial, 48 participants); 
• keyhole or open surgery (1 trial, 54 participants with 56 trapped nerves).
Key results and quality of the evidence 
Written information alone was as effective in improving work activities and reducing pain at night as when people also used splints or did exercises. 
Researchers found no evidence that corticosteroid injection was effective in improving symptoms of UNE. 
We were able to combine results from three trials comparing two surgical techniques: simple decompression and transposition of the ulnar nerve (subcutaneous or submuscular). We found no important difference in symptom scores between the techniques at 6 to 12 months. Decompression with transposition may result in more deep and superficial wound infections. Trialists found no clinical differences between surgical techniques in the other surgical trials. People undergoing endoscopic surgery were more likely to have a haematoma (an abnormal collection of blood) after surgery. 
Evidence was insufficient for us to choose the best treatment for UNE. However, we did find that in mild cases, information on movements and positions to avoid may reduce discomfort. Moreover, the combined results from three surgical trials provided moderate‐quality evidence that simple decompression surgery and decompression with transposition may be equally effective, but that decompression with transposition may result in more deep and superficial wound infections. 
The evidence is up to date to 31 May 2016.","# Plain Language Summary: Treatment for Ulnar Neuropathy at the Elbow

## What is this about?

This summary looks at research studies comparing different treatments for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE). This is a condition where a nerve in your elbow gets pinched or squeezed, causing pain, numbness, or weakness in your hand and arm.

## Why does this matter?

UNE is a common nerve problem. Doctors can treat it in different ways—either without surgery (conservative treatment) or with surgery. However, doctors aren't sure which treatment works best.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at 9 high-quality studies involving 587 people with UNE. They compared:
- Different types of surgery
- Surgery versus non-surgical treatment
- Different non-surgical approaches

## What did they find?

**Surgery comparisons:**
- Two common surgeries worked equally well: simple nerve release versus nerve release with moving the nerve. About 70 out of 100 people improved with either approach.
- Moving the nerve caused more wound infections than simple release.
- Endoscopic (camera-assisted) surgery worked as well as traditional open surgery.

**Non-surgical treatment:**
- In mild cases, advice about avoiding certain arm positions and movements helped reduce discomfort.
- Night splints and nerve exercises didn't add extra benefit.
- Steroid injections didn't help more than placebo (fake treatment).

## What's the bottom line?

Researchers don't have enough evidence to say whether surgery or non-surgical treatment is better overall. For mild cases, simple advice about positioning may help. For more severe cases, both types of surgery work similarly, though simple release has fewer infections.","**Understanding Ulnar Neuropathy at the Elbow: A Study**

**What is Being Studied?**
This study looks at the best ways to treat ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE), a common nerve issue. It compares conservative (non-surgical) and surgical treatments to see which works better and if they are safe.

**Who is Participating?**
The study involves people with symptoms suggesting UNE. A total of 587 participants across nine different studies were included.

**What Treatments Were Tested?**

1. **Surgical Treatments:**
   - **Simple Decompression:** Relieves pressure on the nerve.
   - **Decompression with Transposition:** Moves the nerve to a new location.
   - **Medial Epicondylectomy vs. Anterior Transposition**
   - **Subcutaneous vs. Submuscular Transposition**
   - **Endoscopic vs. Open Decompression**

2. **Conservative Treatments:**
   - Information on avoiding certain movements or positions.
   - Night splinting and nerve exercises.
   - Corticosteroid injections.

**What Did the Study Find?**

- **Surgical Treatment:**
  - Simple decompression and transposition are equally effective.
  - Transposition can lead to more wound infections.
  - No difference in outcomes between other types of surgical approaches.

- **Conservative Treatment:**
  - Learning which movements to avoid helps reduce discomfort in mild cases.
  - No added benefit from splints or exercises.
  - Corticosteroid injections did not show improvement.

**Safety and Risks:**
- Transposition may lead to more infections.
- Endoscopic surgery may cause more bruising (hematoma).

**Conclusion:**
Current evidence doesn’t clearly show the best way to treat UNE. Both main surgical methods are effective, but some may have higher risk of complications. Non-surgical advice is helpful for mild symptoms. More research is needed to decide when surgery or conservative treatment is the better choice."
"Background
Prostaglandins have been used for induction of labour since the 1960s. This is one of a series of reviews evaluating methods of induction of labour. This review focuses on prostaglandins given per vaginam, evaluating these in comparison with placebo (or expectant management) and with each other; prostaglandins (PGE2 and PGF2a); different formulations (gels, tablets, pessaries) and doses. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of vaginal prostaglandins E2 and F2a for third trimester cervical ripening or induction of labour in comparison with placebo/no treatment or other vaginal prostaglandins (except misoprostol). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (1 March 2014) and bibliographies of relevant papers. 
Selection criteria
Clinical trials comparing vaginal prostaglandins used for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction with placebo/no treatment, with each other, or other methods listed above it on a predefined list of labour induction methods. 
Data collection and analysis
We assessed studies and extracted data independently.
Main results
Seventy randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (11,487 women) are included. In this update seven new RCTs (778 women) have been added. Two of these new trials compare PGE2 with no treatment, four compare different PGE2 formulations (gels versus tablets, or sustained release pessaries) and one trial compares PGF2a with placebo. The majority of trials were at unclear risk of bias for most domains. 
Overall, vaginal prostaglandin E2 compared with placebo or no treatment probably reduces the likelihood of vaginal delivery not being achieved within 24 hours. The risk of uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes is increased (4.8% versus 1.0%, risk ratio (RR) 3.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 5.98, 15 trials, 1359 women). The caesarean section rate is probably reduced by about 10% (13.5% versus 14.8%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.02, 36 trials, 6599 women). The overall effect on improving maternal and fetal outcomes (across a variety of measures) is uncertain. 
PGE2 tablets, gels and pessaries (including sustained release preparations) appear to be as effective as each other, small differences are detected between some outcomes, but these maybe due to chance. 
Authors' conclusions
Prostaglandins PGE2 probably increase the chance of vaginal delivery in 24 hours, they increase uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart changes but do not effect or may reduce caesarean section rates. They increase the likelihood of cervical change, with no increase in operative delivery rates. PGE2 tablets, gels and pessaries appear to be as effective as each other, any differences between formulations are marginal but may be important.","Vaginal prostaglandin (PGE2 and PGF2a) for induction of labour at term
Induction of labour is offered to pregnant women when it is thought the outcome will be better for the mother and/or baby if the baby is born than if the pregnancy continues. Common reasons include prolonged pregnancy, prelabour rupture of the membranes, concerns about the health of the mother such as pre‐eclampsia or the baby such as poor growth. Prostaglandins are hormones, produced throughout the body and can be used to start (induce) labour. They are applied locally to the vagina as tablets, gels, suppositories and pessaries to reduce side‐effects. The dose, number of doses, and time between doses vary considerably. Sustained release pessaries reduce the need for repeat doses and so the number of vaginal examinations. 
This review set out to determine the effectiveness and safety of vaginal prostaglandins for third trimester cervical ripening and induction of labour (the cervix softens, shortens and opens, the uterus starts to contract regularly). Eight different comparisons were made, different vaginal prostaglandins were compared with placebos or no treatment, or other vaginal prostaglandins (PGE2, PGF2a, except misoprostol) and different preparations and dosages were compared. We identified 70 studies involving a total of 11,487 women. Vaginal prostaglandins increase the likelihood of vaginal birth within 24 hours, but they can also stimulate the uterus to contract too much and this may cause the baby's heart to slow, however they did not increase the caesarean section rate and may reduce it. Overall, the trials do not show any effect (improvement or worsening) of many important outcomes. Prostaglandin E2 tablets, gels, or pessaries including sustained release preparations appear to be as good as each other or the differences between them are small and have not yet been detected in the trials. Lower‐dose regimens, as defined in the review, appeared to be as good as higher‐dose regimens (eight trials, 1615 women). 
Very limited data were available in the included trials on time in labour and patient satisfaction. Few studies have addressed issues relating to the safety of using vaginal prostaglandins for induction of labour as outpatients.","# Plain Language Summary: Vaginal Prostaglandins for Labor Induction

## What is this study about?

This review looked at research on using vaginal prostaglandins (a type of medicine) to help start labor or prepare the body for labor. Researchers wanted to understand how well these medicines work and how safe they are.

## Who was studied?

The review included 70 research studies with a total of 11,487 pregnant women. The studies compared different ways of using prostaglandins or compared prostaglandins to no treatment.

## What was tested?

Researchers looked at two types of prostaglandins (called PGE2 and PGF2a) that are placed in the vagina. They also compared different forms of these medicines—gels, tablets, and pessaries (small inserts).

## What did they find?

**Good news:**
- Prostaglandins probably help more women deliver vaginally within 24 hours
- The cesarean section rate (surgical delivery) may be slightly lower

**Concerns:**
- The uterine hyperstimulation rate (the uterus contracting too much) increased from 1% to about 5%, which can affect the baby's heart rate
- Different forms (gels, tablets, pessaries) worked about the same as each other

## Bottom line

Vaginal prostaglandins probably help labor progress, but they do increase the risk of the uterus contracting too much. The different forms of the medicine appear equally effective.","**Plain Language Summary: Understanding Prostaglandins for Starting Labor**

**Objective:**
This summary explains a study about using medications called prostaglandins to help start labor in pregnant women.

**Who Was Involved:**
The study looked at 70 different clinical trials involving 11,487 pregnant women in their third trimester.

**What Was Studied:**
Researchers studied prostaglandins, focusing on two types: PGE2 and PGF2a. They wanted to see how well these medications work compared to doing nothing or using other similar medicines. The prostaglandins were given in different forms like gels, tablets, and pessaries (a type of small insert).

**Key Findings:**
- PGE2, compared to doing nothing, probably helps more women have a vaginal delivery within 24 hours.
- There is a higher chance of a side effect called uterine hyperstimulation (increased contractions) with PGE2, affecting fetal heart rate.
- Using PGE2 might lower the need for a cesarean section (C-section) by a small amount.
- Gels, tablets, and pessaries of PGE2 seem to work about the same.
- The overall benefits for mothers and babies are not clear.

**Safety:**
While the medication helps start labor, it can lead to stronger contractions.

**Timeline:**
The study included research up to March 2014, with 7 new trials added in that time frame.

**Conclusion:**
Using PGE2 may help start labor within a day and could reduce C-section rates. The different forms of the medication work similarly, with only small differences between them."
"Background
Tuberculosis (TB) of the gastrointestinal tract and any other organ within the abdominal cavity is abdominal TB, and most guidelines recommend the same six‐month regimen used for pulmonary TB for people with this diagnosis. However, some physicians are concerned whether a six‐month treatment regimen is long enough to prevent relapse of the disease, particularly in people with gastrointestinal TB, which may sometimes cause antituberculous drugs to be poorly absorbed. On the other hand, longer regimens are associated with poor adherence, which could increase relapse, contribute to drug resistance developing, and increase costs to patients and health providers. 
Objectives
To compare six‐month versus longer drug regimens to treat people that have abdominal TB. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases up to 2 September 2016: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase (accessed via OvidSP), LILACS, INDMED, and the South Asian Database of Controlled Clinical Trials. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. We also checked article reference lists. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared six‐month regimens versus longer regimens that consisted of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol to treat adults and children that had abdominal TB. The primary outcomes were relapse, with a minimum of six‐month follow‐up after completion of antituberculous treatment (ATT), and clinical cure at the end of ATT. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included trials. For analysis of dichotomous outcomes, we used risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate, we pooled data from the included trials in meta‐analyses. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included three RCTs, with 328 participants, that compared six‐month regimens with nine‐month regimens to treat adults with intestinal and peritoneal TB. All trials were conducted in Asia, and excluded people with HIV, those with co‐morbidities and those who had received ATT in the previous five years. Antituberculous regimens were based on isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, and these drugs were administered daily or thrice weekly under a directly observed therapy programme. The median duration of follow‐up after completion of treatment was between 12 and 39 months. 
Relapse was uncommon, with two cases among 140 participants treated for six months, and no events among 129 participants treated for nine months. The small number of participants means we do not know whether or not there is a difference in risk of relapse between the two regimens (very low quality evidence). At the end of therapy, there was probably no difference in the proportion of participants that achieved clinical cure between six‐month and nine‐month regimens (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.08; 294 participants, 3 trials, moderate quality evidence). For death, there were 2/150 (1.3%) in the six‐month group and 4/144 (2.8%) in the nine‐month group. All deaths occurred in the first four months of treatment, so was not linked to the duration of treatment in the included trials. Similarly, the number of participants that defaulted from treatment was small in both groups, and there may be no difference between them (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.59; 294 participants, 3 trials, low quality evidence). Only one trial reported on adherence to treatment, with only one participant allocated to the nine‐month regimen presenting poor adherence to treatment. We do not know whether six‐month regimens are associated with fewer people experiencing adverse events that lead to treatment interruption (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.55; 318 participants, 3 trials, very low quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
We found no evidence to suggest that six‐month treatment regimens are inadequate for treating people that have intestinal and peritoneal TB, but numbers are small. We did not find any incremental benefits of nine‐month regimens regarding relapse at the end of follow‐up, or clinical cure at the end of therapy, but our confidence in the relapse estimate is very low because of size of the trials. Further research is required to make confident conclusions regarding the safety of six‐month treatment for people with abdominal TB. Larger studies that include HIV‐positive people, with long follow‐up for detecting relapse with reliability, would help improve our knowledge around this therapeutic question.","Six‐month therapy for people with abdominal tuberculosis
What is abdominal tuberculosis and why is duration of treatment important? 
Abdominal tuberculosis (TB) is a type of TB that affects the gut, the peritoneum (the lining of the abdominal cavity), abdominal lymph nodes, and, more rarely, the solid organs in the abdomen (liver, pancreas, and spleen). Abdominal TB leads to severe illness in adults and children, and can cause complications, such as bowel rupture, which can lead to death. 
Most current guidelines recommend treating people that have abdominal TB with antituberculous treatment (ATT) for six months, but some clinicians treat for longer periods due to concerns that six months is not adequate to achieve cure and prevent relapse of the disease after the end of treatment. Longer ATT regimens have disadvantages: patients may find it more difficult to adhere to the tablets; patients are exposed to the risk of side effects of ATT for longer periods; and the cost to health systems and to patients is greater. 
What the evidence shows 
Cochrane researchers examined the available evidence up to the 2 September 2016. We included three trials with 328 participants that compared six‐month ATT with nine‐month ATT; two were from India and one was from South Korea. The trials were mostly of high quality, although two had concerns of risk of bias for detecting relapse of the disease. All the trials included HIV‐negative adults with TB of the gut (gastrointestinal TB), and one also included TB of the peritoneum (peritoneal TB). 
The results show that relapse was an uncommon event, but we are uncertain whether or not there is a difference between the six‐month and nine‐month groups as numbers of participants are small (very low quality evidence). Six‐month and nine‐month regimens are probably similarly effective in terms of the chances of achieving cure (moderate quality evidence). Death was uncommon in both groups, and all deaths occurred during the first four months of ATT, which suggests that duration of treatment did not have an effect on risk of death. Few people had poor treatment compliance, and few participants experienced side effects that led to their treatment being stopped or changed, and it was not possible to detect a difference between the groups. 
Six‐month regimens are probably as good as nine‐month regimens in terms of numbers of people cured. We found no evidence to suggest that six‐month regimens are less safe for gastrointestinal and peritoneal TB than nine‐month regimens, but we still do not know whether there is a difference in risk of relapse between the two regimens. Further studies are needed to increase our confidence as to whether six‐month regimens are as good as nine‐month regimens for preventing relapse; and to provide information about treating abdominal TB in children and in people with HIV.","# Plain Language Summary: Treatment Length for Abdominal Tuberculosis

## What is this study about?

This review looked at studies comparing two different lengths of medicine treatment for a type of tuberculosis (TB) that affects the stomach and intestines. Doctors weren't sure if the standard 6-month treatment was long enough, or if patients needed 9 months of medicine instead.

## Why does this matter?

TB in the stomach and intestines is serious. Some doctors worried that 6 months of medicine might not fully cure the disease because the stomach and intestines don't always absorb the TB medicines well. However, longer treatment can make it harder for patients to stick with taking their medicine every day, which could cause problems like the disease coming back or the TB becoming resistant to medicine.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for studies that compared 6-month versus 9-month TB treatment plans. They found 3 studies with 328 total patients (all adults) from Asia. All patients received the same four TB medicines, taken either daily or three times per week under supervision.

## What did they find?

**Disease coming back:** Very few patients had TB return after treatment ended. Only 2 out of 140 patients in the 6-month group had relapse, and 0 out of 129 in the 9-month group. The numbers were too small to say for sure if one treatment length was better.

**Getting better:** About the same number of patients in both groups got better by the end of treatment.

**Deaths:** A few patients died in both groups (1.3% in the 6-month group and 2.8% in the 9-month group), but these happened early in treatment and weren't related to how long treatment lasted.

**Sticking with treatment:** Most patients in both groups stayed with their treatment plan.

**Side effects:** Information was limited, but side effects didn't seem to cause more people to stop treatment in either group.

## Bottom line

The studies found no proof that 6 months of treatment is too short for this type of TB. However, the studies were small, so researchers need larger studies to be more confident in these results.","### Plain Language Summary

**Purpose of the Study**
This study looked at how long people should take medicine for a type of TB that affects the stomach area, called abdominal TB. Doctors usually treat it with a six-month course like lung TB, but some worry that six months might not be long enough. This study compared six-month and nine-month treatment plans.

**Who Was Involved?**
The study included 328 adults from Asia with abdominal TB. People with HIV or other health issues were not included. The treatment contained four main drugs: isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.

**What Was Done?**
Participants were given the medicine either daily or three times a week, and doctors watched to make sure they took it. They were checked for up to 39 months after the treatment ended to see how they did.

**Key Findings**
- **Relapse:** Very few people got sick again. In the six-month group, 2 out of 140 people relapsed. Nobody relapsed in the nine-month group. The small number of people makes it unclear if one treatment is better.
- **Cure Rates:** At the end of treatment, about the same number of people got better with both the six-month and nine-month treatments.
- **Deaths:** Some people died in both groups, but these deaths happened early and didn’t relate to the treatment length.
- **Sticking to Treatment:** Most people finished their medicine. Only one person in the nine-month group didn’t stick to the plan.
- **Side Effects:** There’s not enough information to know if shorter treatment causes fewer side effects.

**Conclusions**
The six-month treatment might be just as good as nine months for abdominal TB, but more research is needed to be sure. Future studies should include people with HIV and follow them longer to see if the illness comes back."
"Background
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive, life‐limiting, multisystem disease affecting over 70,000 individuals worldwide. Between 80% and 90% of people with CF suffer with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, which if left untreated, leads to a poor nutritional status. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) has been shown to be effective in improving nutritional status and subsequently associated with improved lung function. However, the timings of PERT administration in relation to a meal are subjective and not standardised, meaning that variations in the timing of PERT dosing persist. 
Objectives
The primary objective of the review is to compare the efficacy (fat absorption) and effectiveness (nutritional status, lung function and quality of life) of different PERT dosing strategies in terms of timing of administration for treating dietary malabsorption in all individuals with CF. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. 
Date of last search: 24 June 2021.
We also searched ongoing trials registers on 09 July 2021.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over RCTs with a minimum washout period of two weeks, and quasi‐RCTs of PERT dosing regimens in people (of any age) with CF. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed and screened the studies identified from the searches. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for our pre‐specified critical outcomes, but we did not identify any eligible studies. 
Main results
No studies met the eligibility criteria and therefore we did not include any in this review. The excluded studies were either cross‐over in design (but lacking a sufficient washout period between treatments) or did not assess the timing of PERT. One study which was terminated early is awaiting assessment pending further information. 
Authors' conclusions
We were unable to determine whether one dosing schedule for PERT is better than another since we identified no eligible RCTs. While the introduction of PERT to people with CF can improve their nutritional status, there are a limited number of studies which address this review question, and none met our eligibility criteria. Since malnutrition and adverse gastrointestinal symptoms remain a common feature in CF, the assessment of the relative performance of dosing schedules may provide evidence to improve outcomes in people with CF who are pancreatic insufficient. 
Further research is needed to fully evaluate the role of dosing schedules for PERT in fat absorption. Research should also establish reliable outcome measures and minimal clinically important differences. While RCTs with a cross‐over design may have advantages over a parallel group design, an adequate washout period between intervention periods is essential.","Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy timings in cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the different timings of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) in people (of any age) with cystic fibrosis (CF). 
Background 
CF is an inherited condition affecting over 70,000 individuals worldwide. Between 80% and 90% of people with CF are not able to produce enough pancreatic enzymes to breakdown and absorb fat, protein and fat‐soluble vitamins from food. This can lead to fatty stools (poo) and weight loss. It is thought that if fat is not digested properly, it could contribute to a higher risk of developing constipation or other serious gut complications such as distal intestinal obstruction syndrome. 
PERT provides the enzymes required to breakdown fat and the dosage is based upon the fat content of a meal or the person's body weight. PERT has been shown to improve weight and is associated with improved lung function. Despite current dose guidance, there are differences in PERT doses and there is no set guidance for when the therapy should be taken in relation to a meal (i.e. before, during or after eating). 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 24 June 2021.
Study characteristics 
We did not find any studies where PERT was given to people with CF who were pancreatic insufficient at different timings relative to their meals. We excluded nine studies. Four of these assessed the timing of PERT administration, but they had a cross‐over design where participants had one intervention and then swapped to the second intervention. We excluded these studies because they did not leave enough time between the different interventions to be sure that the effects of the first intervention were not affecting the results from the second intervention. Four studies did not look at the timing of PERT and one study evaluated a new educational program for PERT. One study was terminated early and we will assess this again at the first update of this review if we are able to obtain more information from the investigators. 
Key results 
No studies met the eligibility criteria. Further research is needed to work out the best time to take PERT in relation to a meal.","# Plain Language Summary: Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy Timing in Cystic Fibrosis

## What is this review about?

This review looked at whether the **timing** of taking pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) matters for people with cystic fibrosis (CF).

## Background

Cystic fibrosis is a serious genetic disease that affects about 70,000 people worldwide. Most people with CF have trouble digesting food because their pancreas doesn't work properly. When the pancreas doesn't work well, the body can't absorb nutrients from food, especially fats. This causes malnutrition and can affect lung health.

Doctors give patients PERT—medicine that replaces the enzymes the pancreas should make—to help them digest food better. However, there's no standard rule for **when** patients should take this medicine in relation to meals. Some people take it before eating, some during, and some after. Nobody knows which timing works best.

## What the researchers wanted to find out

The researchers wanted to compare different ways of timing PERT doses to see which helps people:
- Absorb more fat from food
- Get better nutrition
- Have better lung function
- Have a better quality of life

## What they found

The researchers searched for high-quality studies comparing different PERT timing schedules. **They found no studies that met their requirements.** Some studies they found either had design problems or didn't test what the researchers were looking for.

## Conclusion

We don't yet have evidence showing which timing schedule for PERT works best. More research is needed to answer this important question.","### Plain Language Summary

**Purpose of the Study**

This study looks at the best time to take pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) for people with cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is a disease that affects many parts of the body and makes it hard to absorb food, especially fats. PERT helps people with CF digest food better, which can improve their health and lung function.

**What We Did**

Researchers wanted to compare different times for taking PERT to see which is best for helping people with CF absorb fat, stay well-nourished, breathe better, and feel better overall.

**Method**

The team searched many databases and other sources for studies that tested different PERT schedules. They looked for high-quality studies with specific rules, like having a break between different treatment methods.

**Main Findings**

The researchers did not find any suitable studies that met their criteria. Some studies did not have a long enough break between treatments or didn't focus on PERT timing.

**Conclusions**

Since no eligible studies were found, it's unclear if taking PERT at a specific time is better. PERT is known to help people with CF, but more research is needed to find the best schedule for taking it. Future studies should be well-planned to answer these questions and improve the health of people with CF."
"Background
Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) (bleeding from the genital tract after childbirth) is a major cause of maternal mortality and disability, particularly in under‐resourced areas. In these settings, uterotonics are often not accessible. There is a need for simple, inexpensive techniques which can be applied in low‐resourced settings to prevent and treat PPH. Uterine massage is recommended as part of the routine active management of the third stage of labour. However, it is not known whether it is effective. If shown to be effective, uterine massage would represent a simple intervention with the potential to have a major effect on PPH and maternal mortality in under‐resourced settings. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of uterine massage after birth and before or after delivery of the placenta, or both, to reduce postpartum blood loss and associated morbidity and mortality. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2013). 
Selection criteria
All published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials comparing uterine massage alone or in addition to uterotonics before or after delivery of the placenta, or both, with non‐massage. 
Data collection and analysis
Two researchers independently considered trials for eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted the data using the agreed form. Data were checked for accuracy. The effect of uterine massage commenced before or after placental delivery were first assessed separately, and then the combined for an overall result. 
Main results
This review included two randomised controlled trials. The first trial included 200 women who were randomised to receive uterine massage or no massage following delivery of the placenta, after active management of the third stage of labour including use of oxytocin. The numbers of women with blood loss more than 500 mL was small, with no statistically significant difference (risk ratio (RR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 1.67). There were no cases of retained placenta in either group. The mean blood loss was significantly less in the uterine massage group at 30 minutes (mean difference (MD) ‐41.60 mL, 95% CI ‐75.16 to ‐8.04) and 60 minutes after trial entry (MD ‐77.40 mL, 95% CI ‐118.71 to ‐36.09). The need for additional uterotonics was significantly reduced in the uterine massage group (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.50). 
For use of uterine massage before and after delivery of the placenta, one trial recruited 1964 women in Egypt and South Africa. Women were assigned to receive oxytocin, uterine massage or both after delivery of the baby but before delivery of the placenta. There was no added benefit for uterine massage plus oxytocin over oxytocin alone as regards blood loss greater than or equal to 500 mL (average RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.44, 5.49; random‐effects) or need for additional use of uterotonics (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.85). 
The two trials were combined to examine the effect of uterine massage commenced either before or after delivery of the placenta. There was substantial heterogeneity with respect to the blood loss 500 mL or more after trial entry. The average effect using a random‐effects model found no statistically significant differences between groups (average RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.32; random‐effects). 
Authors' conclusions
The results of this review are inconclusive, and should not be interpreted as a reason to change current practice. Due to the limitations of the included trials, more trials with sufficient numbers of women are needed in order to estimate the effects of sustained uterine massage. All the women compared in this review received oxytocin as part of the active management of labour. Recent research suggests that once an oxytocic has been given, there is limited scope for further reduction in postpartum blood loss. Trials of uterine massage in settings where uterotonics are not available, and which measure women's experience of the procedure, are needed.","Uterine massage for preventing postpartum haemorrhage
Bleeding after childbirth (postpartum haemorrhage) is the leading cause of maternal deaths in Sub‐Saharan Africa and Egypt, and yet it is largely preventable. Possible causes of heavy bleeding directly following childbirth or within the first 24 hours are that the uterus fails to contract after delivery (uterine atony), a retained placenta, inverted or ruptured uterus, and cervical, vaginal, or perineal tears. 
In well‐resourced settings haemorrhage is reduced by routine active management of delivery of the placenta, called the third stage of labour, using a drug to stimulate contraction of the uterus such as oxytocin. Uterine massage after delivery of the placenta can also promote contraction of the uterus. This involves placing a hand on the woman's lower abdomen and stimulating the uterus by repetitive massaging or squeezing movements. 
This review included two controlled trials in which women were randomly assigned to receive uterine massage or no massage with active management of the third stage of labour, including the routine use of oxytocin. 
In one trial involving 200 women, uterine massage was given every 10 minutes for 60 minutes after delivery of the placenta effectively reduced blood loss, and the need for additional uterotonics, by some 80%. The numbers of women losing more than 500 mL of blood were too small for meaningful comparison. Two women in the control group and none in the uterine massage group needed blood transfusions. 
The second trial involved 1964 women who were assigned to receive oxytocin, uterine massage or both after delivery of the baby and before delivery of the placenta. There was no added benefit for uterine massage when oxytocin was used. 
The results of this review are inconclusive. The methodological quality of the two included trials was high but it is possible that there were differences in the procedures used in the study sites. Disadvantages of uterine massage include the use of staff time, and discomfort caused to women. The findings should not change the recommended practice. It is likely that any reduction in blood loss was limited with the use of oxytocin in these trials. Uterine massage may also have increased apparent blood loss by pressing pooled blood out from the uterine cavity. There is a need for more trials, especially in settings where uterotonics are not available. Uterine massage could be a simple inexpensive intervention if proved effective.","# Plain Language Summary: Uterine Massage to Prevent Heavy Bleeding After Childbirth

## What is this study about?

Heavy bleeding after childbirth is a serious problem that can harm or kill mothers, especially in areas without good medical care. This review looked at whether gently massaging the uterus (womb) after a baby is born can help reduce bleeding.

## Why does this matter?

In many places, medicines that stop bleeding after childbirth are hard to get or too expensive. Uterine massage is simple and costs nothing, so it could help many mothers if it works.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at two studies that compared:
- **Group 1:** Women who received uterine massage after birth
- **Group 2:** Women who did not receive uterine massage

Both groups also received standard care, including a medicine called oxytocin to help control bleeding.

## What did they find?

**Study 1** (200 women): Women who got uterine massage had less bleeding at 30 and 60 minutes after birth. They also needed fewer extra medicines to stop bleeding.

**Study 2** (1,964 women): Adding uterine massage to the standard medicine didn't help more than the medicine alone.

**Overall:** The results were mixed and unclear.

## What does this mean?

The researchers say we don't have enough clear evidence yet to know if uterine massage really works. More studies are needed, especially in places where bleeding-control medicines aren't available.","### Simple Summary of the Clinical Trial

**Purpose of the Study:**
The study looked at whether rubbing the uterus after childbirth (uterine massage) helps reduce heavy bleeding, known as postpartum hemorrhage, which can happen after a baby is born. This bleeding is a serious problem in places with limited medical resources.

**Participants:**
The study involved women in different trials from Egypt, South Africa, and other areas.

**What Was Tested:**
The researchers tested if massaging the uterus after a baby is born—either before or after the placenta is delivered—could reduce blood loss compared to not massaging. They also looked at how this worked alongside a common medicine given to reduce bleeding, called oxytocin.

**Key Findings:**
1. One trial showed that women who had uterine massage after the placenta was delivered had less blood loss at 30 and 60 minutes compared to those who didn't get the massage.
2. Uterine massage reduced the need for extra medicine to stop bleeding in that same trial.

3. In another trial, researchers found no extra benefit from combining uterine massage with oxytocin compared to just using oxytocin alone.

4. Overall, when looking at both trials together, the amount of blood loss wasn't greatly different between women who received the massage and those who didn’t.

**Conclusion:**
The results were unclear. More studies are needed to know if uterine massage really works, especially in places where medicines like oxytocin aren't available. Future studies should include more women and see how they feel about the procedure."
"Background
The majority of people with hip fracture are treated surgically, requiring anaesthesia.
Objectives
The main focus of this review is the comparison of regional versus general anaesthesia for hip (proximal femoral) fracture repair in adults. We did not consider supplementary regional blocks in this review as they have been studied in another review. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library; 2014, Issue 3), MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 2003 to March 2014) and EMBASE (Ovid SP, 2003 to March 2014). We reran the search in February 2017. Potential new studies of interest were added to a list of ""Studies awaiting Classification"" and will be incorporated into the formal review findings during the review update. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized trials comparing different methods of anaesthesia for hip fracture surgery in adults. The primary focus of this review was the comparison of regional anaesthesia versus general anaesthesia. The use of nerve blocks preoperatively or in conjunction with general anaesthesia is evaluated in another review. The main outcomes were mortality, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute confusional state, deep vein thrombosis and return of patient to their own home. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We analysed data with fixed‐effect (I2 < 25%) or random‐effects models. We assessed the quality of the evidence according to the criteria developed by the GRADE working group. 
Main results
In total, we included 31 studies (with 3231 participants) in our review. Of those 31 studies, 28 (2976 participants) provided data for the meta‐analyses. For the 28 studies, 24 were used for the comparison of neuraxial block versus general anaesthesia. Based on 11 studies that included 2152 participants, we did not find a difference between the two anaesthetic techniques for mortality at one month: risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.06; I2 = 24% (fixed‐effect model). Based on six studies that included 761 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of pneumonia: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.31; I2 = 0%. Based on four studies that included 559 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of myocardial infarction: RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.22 to 3.65; I2 = 0%. Based on six studies that included 729 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of cerebrovascular accident: RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.83; I2 = 0%. Based on six studies that included 624 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of acute confusional state: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.40; I2 = 49%. Based on laboratory tests, the risk of deep vein thrombosis was decreased when no specific precautions or just early mobilization was used: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.78; I2 = 0%; (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 3, 95% CI 2 to 7, based on a basal risk of 76%) but not when low molecular weight heparin was administered: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.84; I2 for heterogeneity between the two subgroups = 58%. For neuraxial blocks compared to general anaesthesia, we rated the quality of evidence as very low for mortality (at 0 to 30 days), pneumonia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute confusional state, decreased rate of deep venous thrombosis in the absence of potent thromboprophylaxis, and return of patient to their own home. The number of studies comparing other anaesthetic techniques was limited. 
Authors' conclusions
We did not find a difference between the two techniques, except for deep venous thrombosis in the absence of potent thromboprophylaxis. The studies included a wide variety of clinical practices. The number of participants included in the review is insufficient to eliminate a difference between the two techniques in the majority of outcomes studied. Therefore, large randomized trials reflecting actual clinical practice are required before drawing final conclusions.","Regional or general anaesthesia for hip fracture surgery in adults
Background: The majority of people with hip fracture are elderly and are treated surgically, which requires anaesthesia. The fracture usually results from a simple fall. These patients often have many other medical problems associated with ageing, which places them at high risk of mortality after anaesthesia. The most common types of anaesthesia are 'general' and 'regional anaesthesia'. General anaesthesia involves a loss of consciousness (induced sleep). Regional anaesthesia involves an injection of a solution containing local anaesthetic inside the spine (neuraxial block) or around the nerves outside the spine (peripheral nerve block) to prevent pain in the leg with the hip fracture. We reviewed the evidence about the effect of regional anaesthesia on patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture. 
Study characteristics: The evidence is current to March 2014. In total, we included 31 studies (with 3231 participants) in our review. Of those 31 studies, 28 (2976 participants) provided data for the meta‐analyses. The mean age of the participants varied from 75 to 86 years. Those studies were published between 1977 and 2013 and so covering a wide range of clinical practices and improvements in techniques over time. Two studies were funded by the anaesthetic drug manufacturer or by an agency with a commercial interest, one received charitable funding, and one was funded by a government agency. We reran the search in February 2017. Potential new studies of interest were added to a list of ""Studies awaiting Classification"" and will be incorporated into the formal review findings during the review update. 
Key results : The trial reports of many of the studies indicated a sub‐suboptimal level of methodological rigour and the number of participants included was often insufficient to allow us to draw a definitive conclusion on many of the outcomes studied. We did not find any difference in mortality at one month (11 trials with 2152 participants) between neuraxial blocks and general anaesthesia. We also did not find a difference for pneumonia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute confusional state, congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury, pulmonary embolism, number of patients transfused with red blood cells, length of surgery and length of hospital stay between these two anaesthetic techniques in two to twelve studies. Likewise, when potent prophylactic drugs (such as low molecular weight heparin) were used against postoperative clot formation, we did not find a difference in the risk of deep venous thrombosis. Without prophylaxis with potent anticoagulant drugs the risk of deep venous thrombosis was less with neuraxial block. 
Quality of the evidence: The level of evidence was very low for mortality, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute confusional state, decrease in the incidence of deep venous thrombosis in the absence of potent prophylaxis, and return of patient to their own home. This means that any estimate of effect is very uncertain.","# Plain Language Summary: Anesthesia for Hip Fracture Surgery

## What is this study about?

Most people who break their hip need surgery. During surgery, doctors use anesthesia (medicine to put you to sleep or numb the area). This review compared two types of anesthesia: regional anesthesia and general anesthesia.

- **Regional anesthesia**: Numbs just the area around your hip
- **General anesthesia**: Puts you to sleep for the whole surgery

## Who was studied?

The review looked at 31 studies involving 3,231 adults who had hip fracture surgery. Most studies compared regional anesthesia to general anesthesia.

## What did researchers look for?

Researchers checked whether patients had serious problems after surgery, including:
- Death
- Pneumonia (lung infection)
- Heart attack
- Stroke
- Confusion
- Blood clots in the legs
- Whether patients could return home

## What did they find?

**Main finding**: The two types of anesthesia were about the same for most problems. However, patients who received regional anesthesia had fewer blood clots in their legs—but only when they didn't receive blood-thinning medicine.

## Important note

The researchers said they need more and larger studies to be sure about their findings. The studies they reviewed used many different methods, making it hard to compare results.","### Plain Language Summary: Comparing Types of Anesthesia for Hip Fracture Surgery

#### What is this study about?
This study looked at two types of anesthesia used in hip fracture surgeries for adults: regional anesthesia and general anesthesia.

#### Why is this important?
Most people with a hip fracture need surgery and anesthesia. Understanding which type of anesthesia works better can help improve patient outcomes.

#### Who took part in the study?
The review looked at data from 31 studies involving 3,231 adults who needed hip fracture surgery.

#### What did researchers do?
Researchers compared the results of surgeries using either regional anesthesia or general anesthesia. They checked for differences in outcomes like survival, lung infections, heart attacks, strokes, confusion, and how soon people could go back to their own homes.

#### What did they find?
- **Survival and Complications**: There was no clear difference in survival rates, lung infections, heart attacks, strokes, or confusion between the two anesthesia types within the first month after surgery.
- **Blood Clots**: There was a lower risk of blood clots (deep vein thrombosis) when early movement was used instead of medications like blood thinners.
  
#### What do these results mean?
Researchers didn’t find strong evidence showing that one type of anesthesia is better than the other, except for the risk of blood clots. The results were not strong enough to make a final decision, and more research is needed.

#### What’s next?
Bigger studies are necessary to understand better which type of anesthesia is safer and more effective for people undergoing hip fracture surgery."
"Background
Thalassaemia is a genetic disorder of the haemoglobin protein in red blood cells. It has been historically classified into thalassaemia minor, intermedia and major, depending on the genetic defect and severity of the disease. The clinical presentation of β‐thalassaemia varies widely from a mild asymptomatic form in thalassaemia minor, to a severe disease in thalassaemia major where individuals are dependant on life‐long blood transfusions. The hallmark of thalassaemia syndromes is the production of defective red blood cells that are removed by the spleen resulting in an enlarged hyperfunctioning spleen (splenomegaly). Removal of the spleen may thus prolong red blood cell survival by reducing the amount of red blood cells removed from circulation and may ultimately result in the reduced need for blood transfusions. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of splenectomy in people with β‐thalassaemia major or intermedia. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Review Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from searches of electronic databases and the handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched online trial registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews (27 July 2018). 
Date of the most recent search of the Group's trials register: 02 August 2019.
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled and quasi‐randomised controlled studies of people of any age with thalassaemia major or intermedia, evaluating splenectomy in comparison to conservative treatment (transfusion therapy and iron chelation) or other forms of splenectomy compared to each other (laparoscopic, open, radio‐frequency). 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected and extracted data from the single included study using a customised data extraction form and assessed the risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. 
Main results
One study, including 28 participants was included in the review; the results were described, primarily, in a narrative manner. This study assessed the feasibility of splenectomy using a laparoscopic approach versus open surgery. Given the lack of detail regarding the study methods beyond randomisation, the overall risk of bias for this study was unclear. The study was carried out over a period of 3.5 years, with each participant followed up only until discharge (less than one week after the intervention); it did not assess the majority of the outcomes outlined in this review (including two of the three primary outcomes, frequency of transfusion and quality of life). A total of three serious post‐operative adverse events (the review's third primary outcome) were reported in the laparoscopic splenectomy group (one case of atelectasis and two cases of bleeding), compared to two events of atelectasis in the open surgery group; however, there were no significant differences between the groups for either atelectasis, risk ratio (RR) 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 4.90) or for bleeding, RR 5.00 (95% CI 0.26 to 95.61) (very low‐quality evidence). In addition, the study also reported three serious cases of intra‐operative bleeding in the laparoscopic group which mandated conversion to open surgery, although the difference between groups was not statistically significant, RR 7.00 (95% CI 0.39 to 124.14) (very low‐quality evidence). These effect estimates are based on very small numbers and hence are unreliable and imprecise. From this small study, there appeared to be an advantage for the laparoscopic approach, in terms of post‐operative hospital stay, although the group difference was not large (median difference of 1.5 days, P = 0.03). 
Authors' conclusions
The review was unable to find good quality evidence, in the form of randomised controlled studies, regarding the efficacy of splenectomy for treating thalassaemia major or intermedia. The single included study provided little information about the efficacy of splenectomy, and compared open surgery and laparoscopic methods. Further studies need to evaluate the long‐term effectiveness of splenectomy and the comparative advantages of surgical methods. Due to a lack of high quality evidence from randomised controlled studies, well‐conducted observational studies may be used to answer this question.","Removal of the spleen in people with thalassaemia major and intermedia
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence comparing the removal of the spleen (splenectomy) to other treatments (such as blood transfusions and chelation (removal of excess iron) in people with thalassaemia major and intermedia. 
Background 
Thalassaemia is a genetic disease, caused by a defect in production of haemoglobin ‐ which carries oxygen in red blood cells to all the tissues of the body. The clinical presentation of thalassaemia varies widely from a mild asymptomatic form to being dependant on life long blood transfusions. The genetic defect in thalassaemia also results in formation of ineffective red blood cells, which are removed by the spleen which in turn becomes enlarged. Removing the spleen can lengthen the lifespan of red blood cells and reduce the need for transfusions. We wanted to evaluate whether current evidence showed that removing the spleen was safe and effective in the long term and compare different surgical methods of removing the spleen. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 02 August 2019.
Study characteristics 
One study with a total of 28 participant was included in the review. This study compared two methods of splenectomy ‐ laparoscopic (keyhole) versus an open surgical approach. Study participants were recruited over a period of 3.5 years, but participants were only followed up to the end of their hospital stay (usually less than one week). 
Key results 
The study evaluated the two types of surgical methods. Only one of our three primary outcomes were reported, the number of people experiencing major adverse events (bleeding during and after the operation and complete or partial collapse of a lung). However, the amount of information available is not sufficient to draw any reliable conclusions (very‐low quality evidence). Hence, we were unable to provide recommendations regarding the use of splenectomy in people with thalassaemia. Appropriate clinical judgement, in view of the various risks and benefits described by other lower quality sources of evidence (e.g. observational studies), may be necessary when considering splenectomy in people with thalassaemia. 
Quality of the evidence 
While we are satisfied that the participants had equal chances of undergoing either type of surgery, there is not enough information on other aspects of the study to make any overall judgement on its quality.","# Plain Language Summary: Spleen Removal Surgery for Thalassaemia

## What is this study about?

This review looked at research on removing the spleen in people with thalassaemia major or intermedia—serious blood disorders where the body doesn't make healthy red blood cells.

## Why might removing the spleen help?

People with thalassaemia have red blood cells that don't work properly. The spleen removes these bad cells from the blood, which makes the spleen very large and overworked. Doctors think removing the spleen might help the body keep healthy red blood cells longer, so people wouldn't need as many blood transfusions (blood transfers).

## What did researchers find?

The review looked for high-quality studies comparing spleen removal to other treatments. They only found **one study with 28 people**. This study compared two surgical methods:
- **Laparoscopic surgery** (using small cuts and a camera)
- **Open surgery** (using a larger cut)

## What were the results?

**Hospital stay:** People who had laparoscopic surgery went home about 1.5 days sooner than those who had open surgery.

**Complications:** Both groups had some serious problems after surgery, like bleeding and collapsed lung tissue. The numbers were too small to say which method was safer.

**Important limitation:** The study only followed people until they left the hospital (less than a week). It didn't look at whether spleen removal actually reduced the need for blood transfusions or improved quality of life.

## Bottom line

There isn't enough good-quality research to know if removing the spleen really helps people with thalassaemia. More studies are needed.","### Plain Language Summary

**Objective**  
This study looked at whether removing the spleen helps people with a genetic blood condition called β‐thalassaemia major or intermedia. It also checked if this surgery is safe.

**Who Was Involved?**  
The study included people of all ages with β‐thalassaemia major or intermedia.

**What Was Tested?**  
The study compared two ways of removing the spleen: through small cuts with special tools (laparoscopic) and through open surgery. It also compared surgery to usual care like blood transfusions.

**What Did They Find?**  
Only one small study with 28 people was found. It lasted 3.5 years, but each person was only checked for up to a week after surgery. They compared laparoscopic and open surgery methods.

- In the group with laparoscopic surgery, some people had breathing trouble and bleeding.
- In the open surgery group, some had breathing trouble, but not as much bleeding.
- People who had the laparoscopic surgery recovered a bit faster, staying in the hospital about 1.5 days shorter.

**Was It Safe?**  
Both types of surgery had risks, like bleeding and breathing problems, but the study was too small to tell which was better or safer.

**Conclusion**  
The study didn't have strong enough information to say if removing the spleen is really helpful for treating β‐thalassaemia major or intermedia. More research is needed to see if this surgery works for a long time and which method is best.

**Safety Note**  
The information from this small study isn't very reliable, so more high-quality studies are needed."
"Background
Postoperative pain is a common consequence of surgery and can have deleterious effects. It has been suggested that the administration of opioid analgesia before a painful stimulus may improve pain control. This can be done in two ways. We defined 'preventive opioids' as opioids administered before incision and continued postoperatively, and 'pre‐emptive opioids' as opioids given before incision but not continued postoperatively. Both pre‐emptive and preventive analgesia involve the initiation of an analgesic agent prior to surgical incision with the aim of reducing intraoperative nociception and therefore postoperative pain. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy of preventive and pre‐emptive opioids for reducing postoperative pain in adults undergoing all types of surgery. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, and CINAHL (up to 18 March 2018). In addition, we searched for unpublished studies in three clinical trial databases, conference proceedings, grey literature databases, and reference lists of retrieved articles. We did not apply any restrictions on language or date of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included parallel‐group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) only. We included participants aged over 15 years old undergoing any type of surgery. We defined postincision opioids as the same intervention administered after incision whether single dose (as comparator with pre‐emptive analgesia) or continued postoperatively (as comparator with preventive analgesia) (control group). We considered studies that did and did not use a double‐dummy placebo (e.g. intervention group received active drug before incision and placebo after incision; control group received placebo before incision and active drug after incision). 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were: early acute postoperative pain (measured within six hours and reported on a 0‐to‐10 scale) and respiratory depression. Our secondary outcomes included: late acute postoperative pain (24 to 48 hours and reported on a 0‐to‐10 scale), 24‐hour morphine consumption, and adverse events (intraoperative bradycardia and hypotension). We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome. 
Main results
We included 20 RCTs, including one unpublished study with 1343 participants. Two studies were awaiting classification as the full text for these studies was not available. One study evaluated pre‐emptive opioids, and 19 studies evaluated preventive opioids. We considered only one study to be at low risk of bias for most domains. The surgeries and opioids used varied, although roughly half of the included studies were conducted in abdominal hysterectomy, and around a quarter used morphine as the intervention. All studies were conducted in secondary care. 
Pre‐emptive opioids compared to postincision opioids 
For pre‐emptive opioids in dental surgery, there may be a reduction in early acute postoperative pain (mean difference (MD) ‐1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.75 to ‐0.65; 40 participants; 1 study; low‐quality evidence). This study did not report on adverse events (respiratory depression, bradycardia, or hypotension). There may be a reduction in late acute postoperative pain (MD ‐2.10, 95% CI ‐2.57 to ‐1.63; 40 participants; 1 study; low‐quality evidence). This study did not report 24‐hour morphine consumption. 
Preventive opioids compared to postincision opioids 
For preventive opioids, there was probably no reduction in early acute postoperative pain (MD 0.11, 95% CI ‐0.32 to 0.53; 706 participants; 10 studies; I2 = 61%; moderate‐quality evidence). There were no events of respiratory depression in four studies (433 participants). There was no important reduction in late acute postoperative pain (MD ‐0.06, 95% CI ‐0.13 to 0.01; 668 participants; 9 studies; I2 = 0%; moderate‐quality evidence). There may be a small reduction in 24‐hour morphine consumption (MD ‐4.91 mg, 95% CI ‐9.39 mg to ‐0.44 mg; 526 participants; 11 studies; I2 = 82%; very low‐quality evidence). There may be similar rates of bradycardia (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.88; 112 participants; 2 studies; I2 = 0%; low‐quality evidence) and hypotension (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.25 to 4.73; 88 participants; 2 studies; I2 = 0%; low‐quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Due to the low quality of the evidence, we are uncertain whether pre‐emptive opioids reduce postoperative pain. Based on the trials conducted thus far, there was no clear evidence that preventive opioids result in reductions in pain scores. It was unclear if there was a reduction in morphine consumption due to very low‐quality of evidence. Too few studies reported adverse events to be able to draw any definitive conclusions. Once assessed, the two studies awaiting classification may alter the conclusions of the review.","Pre‐emptive and preventive opioids for postoperative pain in adults undergoing all types of surgery 
To assess the ability of a single dose of opioid given before making the first cut during surgery (pre‐emptive opioids) and preventive opioids that are given before the first cut and continued after surgery for reducing pain due to surgery in adults. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for opioid painkillers (strong painkillers) when given before surgery, compared to the same painkiller given only after the surgeon has cut the skin. 
Background 
Most people experience pain after surgery that requires strong opioid painkillers. These medications are associated with a number of side effects including depressed breathing, a slow heart rate, and low blood pressure, as well as vomiting, drowsiness, itching, and constipation. Reducing the amount of opioid needed can limit these side effects and improve the patient experience. Compared to starting painkillers later, beginning painkillers before making the first cut for surgery may reduce pain sensitivity, and so lessen the postoperative pain experienced. We wanted to find out whether giving opioid painkillers before surgery was more effective than giving the same painkiller after surgery. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the medical literature for randomized controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to a treatment group using a random method) in March 2018. Participants were randomly allocated to one of two groups. One group was treated with opioids before the surgeon cut the skin, whilst the other group was given the same medication after the surgeon cut the skin. We identified 20 trials involving a total of 1343 participants aged over 15 years who were undergoing a variety of surgeries. In all but one trial, participants received general anaesthetic. Nearly all participants were low‐risk patients. Only one of the trials used a pre‐emptive dose of opioid. 
Key results 
In one small trial (40 participants) involving people undergoing dental surgery, use of pre‐emptive opioids resulted in a small reduction in pain experienced in the first six hours after surgery and at 24 to 48 hours based on low‐quality evidence. This study did not report on adverse events or 24‐hour morphine consumption. 
For preventive opioids started before the first cut was made and continued over the first day after surgery, pain in the first six hours after surgery was similar to when the first opioid dose was given after the first cut to the skin (10 studies; 706 participants). Postoperative pain 24 to 48 hours after surgery was similar between groups (9 studies; 668 participants). The evidence for both these findings was of moderate quality. The following findings were supported by low‐ or very low‐quality evidence. A reduction in 24‐hour morphine consumption was too small to be clinically relevant (11 studies; 526 participants). Not all studies reported on adverse events, but the numbers of participants with respiratory depression (4 studies; 433 participants), low heart rate (2 studies; 112 participants), or low blood pressure (2 studies; 88 participants) were similar between groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main issues concerning the included trials were high risk of bias due to limitations in how the findings were presented, the design and conduct of the studies, and wide variations in the findings, which led to uncertainty in the results. Consequently, we found no convincing evidence that starting opioids before the beginning of surgery reduces levels of pain after surgery or the need for continuing opioids.","# Plain Language Summary: Opioids Given Before Surgery to Reduce Pain After Surgery

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether giving pain medicine (opioids) before surgery helps reduce pain after surgery. Researchers wanted to know if this approach works better than giving the pain medicine after surgery starts.

## Why does this matter?

Pain after surgery is common and can cause problems for patients. Doctors wondered if giving pain medicine *before* surgery begins might help control pain better afterward.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for studies that tested two approaches:
- **Preventive opioids**: Pain medicine given before surgery and continued after surgery
- **Pre-emptive opioids**: Pain medicine given before surgery but stopped after surgery begins

They looked for studies with adults (over 15 years old) having any type of surgery. They found 20 studies with 1,343 people total.

## What did they find?

**For pre-emptive opioids (one dental surgery study):**
- Patients may have had less pain right after surgery and the next day
- The study didn't report on side effects

**For preventive opioids (19 studies):**
- Pain scores right after surgery were about the same as giving medicine after surgery started
- Pain scores the next day were about the same
- Patients may have used slightly less pain medicine overall (about 5 mg less morphine in 24 hours)
- Side effects like slow heart rate or low blood pressure were similar in both groups

## What does this mean?

The evidence is not strong enough to say that giving opioids before surgery clearly helps reduce pain afterward. More research is needed to understand if this approach really works.","### Plain Language Summary

**Why Was This Study Done?**

After surgery, people often feel pain. We wanted to see if giving certain painkillers, called opioids, before surgery helps reduce this pain. There are two ways to do this: 

- **Pre-emptive Opioids**: Given before surgery but not continued after.
- **Preventive Opioids**: Given before and continued after surgery.

**What Was the Study About?**

We looked at how well these methods work for reducing pain after surgery in adults. We included a range of surgeries and looked at any useful studies we could find.

**How Was the Study Done?**

We found studies that tested these methods by comparing groups who got these opioids with those who got them after surgery started. We looked at pain levels shortly after surgery and one or two days later. We also checked if people had any bad side effects.

**What Did We Find?**

- **Pre-emptive Opioids**: They seemed to help reduce pain early and later after dental surgery, but we didn't find much other evidence. We couldn't find information on side effects or how much more pain medicine people needed later.

- **Preventive Opioids**: These didn’t seem to lower pain right after surgery or a day later. They might slightly reduce the need for more pain medicine, but we didn’t have strong evidence. We also didn’t find enough information about side effects like slow heart rate or low blood pressure.

**Our Conclusion**

We’re not sure if giving opioids before surgery helps much due to limited and low-quality evidence. More detailed studies are needed to know for sure. Future studies could change our understanding."
"Background
Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists have been shown to have a neuroprotectant effect in reducing infarct size and improving functional outcome in animal models of cerebrovascular disease. However, the sedative effects of GABA receptor agonists have limited their wider application in people with acute stroke, due to the potential risk of stupor. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013, and previously updated in 2014 and 2016. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy and safety of GABA receptor agonists in the treatment of acute stroke. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (accessed May 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2018, Issue 4 (accessed May 2018), MEDLINE (from 1949 to May 2018), Embase (from 1980 to May 2018), CINAHL (from 1982 to May 2018), AMED (from 1985 to May 2018), and 11 Chinese databases (accessed May 2018). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials we searched ongoing trial registers, reference lists, and relevant conference proceedings, and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating GABA receptor agonists versus placebo for people with acute stroke (within 12 hours after stroke onset), with the primary outcomes of efficacy and safety. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified records, selected studies for inclusion, extracted eligible data, cross‐checked the data for accuracy, and assessed the risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We included five trials with 3838 participants (acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke patients, 3758 analyzed). Most of the participants recruited had acute ischaemic stroke, with limited data available from participants with other stroke subtypes, including total anterior circulation syndrome (TACS). The methodological quality of the included trials was generally good, with an unclear risk for selection bias only. For death and dependency at three months, pooled results did not find a significant difference for chlormethiazole versus placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.11; four trials; 2909 participants; moderate‐quality evidence) and for diazepam versus placebo (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.07; one trial; 849 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). The most frequent adverse events related to chlormethiazole were somnolence (RR 4.56, 95% CI 3.50 to 5.95; two trials; 2527 participants; moderate‐quality evidence) and rhinitis (RR 4.75, 95% CI 2.67 to 8.46; two trials; 2527 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides moderate‐quality evidence that fails to support the use of GABA receptor agonists (chlormethiazole or diazepam) for the treatment of people with acute stroke. More well‐designed RCTs with large samples of participants with total anterior circulation syndrome are required to determine if there are benefits for this subgroup. Somnolence and rhinitis are frequent adverse events related to chlormethiazole.","Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists for acute stroke
Question: Are GABA receptor agonist drugs effective and safe in the treatment of acute stroke?  Background: GABA receptor agonists are a type of drug that may help protect the brain in acute stroke. This group of drugs, which includes diazepam and chlormethiazole, has been used as traditional sedatives for several decades, and have been found to be beneficial in stroke studies in animals. However, the sedative effect of GABA receptor agonists could be harmful for people with acute stroke.  Study characteristics: We identified five studies to May 2018 that met our inclusion criteria; they randomized 3838 participants (acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke patients) and analyzed 3758. The quality of all the studies was generally good, with a low risk of bias. One study tested the effects and safety of diazepam for acute stroke in 849 participants within 12 hours of stroke onset. Four studies tested the effects and safety of chlormethiazole in 2909 participants with acute stroke, within 12 hours of stroke onset; 95 participants had stroke caused by bleeding and were analyzed separately.  Key results: All five trials reported death and dependency at three months. There was no significant difference between the chlormethiazole and placebo groups or between the diazepam and placebo groups. The most frequent side effects caused by chlormethiazole were drowsiness and nasal irritation.  Quality of the evidence: In conclusion, moderate‐quality evidence did not support the use of GABA receptor agonists for the treatment of people with acute stroke.","# Plain Language Summary: GABA Receptor Agonists for Acute Stroke

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether certain medicines called GABA receptor agonists help people who have just had a stroke. Researchers wanted to know if these medicines are safe and effective for treating acute stroke (stroke that happens within 12 hours).

## Why does this matter?

In laboratory studies, GABA receptor agonists showed promise in protecting the brain after a stroke. However, these medicines can make people very sleepy, which might be dangerous. Researchers wanted to find out if the benefits outweigh the risks.

## What did researchers do?

Scientists searched for all high-quality studies that tested GABA receptor agonists against placebo (fake medicine) in people with acute stroke. They found 5 studies with about 3,838 people total. Most participants had ischemic stroke (caused by a blood clot).

## What were the main findings?

**Did the medicines help?**
- The medicines did not reduce death or disability at three months compared to placebo
- Results were similar for two different medicines tested: chlormethiazole and diazepam

**What side effects happened?**
- Chlormethiazole caused drowsiness in many people (4.5 times more than placebo)
- Chlormethiazole also caused stuffy/runny nose in many people (4.7 times more than placebo)

## Bottom line

Based on moderate-quality evidence, GABA receptor agonists do not appear to help people with acute stroke. The medicines caused significant sleepiness and nasal problems. More research is needed to be certain.","### Plain Language Summary

**Background**

This study looks at medicines called GABA receptor agonists. These medicines have helped animals recover better from some brain problems. But, in people, they can make you very sleepy, which is a concern for treating strokes.

**Objective**

The study aims to see if these medicines are safe and work well for people who just had a stroke.

**How the Study Was Done**

The researchers looked at many previous studies up until May 2018 to find important information. They checked medical records, talked to experts, and looked for new and ongoing studies.

**Who Was Involved**

There were five studies with 3838 people who had just experienced a stroke.

**What the Studies Found**

- The studies compared people taking the medicines called chlormethiazole and diazepam to those who didn’t (taking a placebo).
- After three months, taking these medicines didn’t really help people recover better from strokes compared to not taking them.
- A common side effect for chlormethiazole was feeling very sleepy and having a runny nose.

**Conclusion**

The evidence doesn’t support using chlormethiazole or diazepam for treating strokes. More research with more people is needed, especially for a specific type of stroke.

**Safety Notes**

People taking these medicines might feel very sleepy, and some may get a runny nose."
"Background
Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common bacterial infection among young children in the United States. There are limitations and concerns over its treatment with antibiotics and surgery and so effective preventative measures are attractive. A potential preventative measure is xylitol, a natural sugar substitute that reduces the risk of dental decay. Xylitol can reduce the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae) and Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae) to nasopharyngeal cells in vitro. This is an update of a review first published in 2011. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of xylitol to prevent AOM in children aged up to 12 years. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (to Issue 12, 2015), MEDLINE (1950 to January 2016), Embase (1974 to January 2016), CINAHL (1981 to January 2016), LILACS (1982 to January 2016), Web of Science (2011 to January 2016) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (2000 to January 2016). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs of children aged 12 years or younger where xylitol supplementation was compared with placebo or no treatment to prevent AOM. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials from search results, assessed and rated study quality and extracted relevant data for inclusion in the review. We contacted trial authors to request missing data. We noted data on any adverse events of xylitol. We extracted data on relevant outcomes and estimated the effect size by calculating risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
Main results
We identified five clinical trials that involved 3405 children for inclusion. For this 2016 update, we identified one new trial for inclusion. This trial was systematically reviewed but due to several sources of heterogeneity, was not included in the meta‐analysis. The remaining four trials were of adequate methodological quality. In three RCTs that involved a total of 1826 healthy Finnish children attending daycare, there is moderate quality evidence that xylitol (in any form) can reduce the risk of AOM from 30% to around 22% compared with the control group (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.88). Among the reasons for dropouts, there were no significant differences in abdominal discomfort and rash between the xylitol and the control groups. Xylitol was not effective in reducing AOM among healthy children during a respiratory infection (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.53; moderate quality evidence) or among otitis‐prone healthy children (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.21; low‐quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
There is moderate quality evidence showing that the prophylactic administration of xylitol among healthy children attending daycare centres can reduce the occurrence of AOM. There is inconclusive evidence with regard to the efficacy of xylitol in preventing AOM among children with respiratory infection, or among otitis‐prone children. The meta‐analysis was limited because data came from a small number of studies, and most were from the same research group.","Xylitol sugar supplement for preventing middle ear infection in children up to 12 years of age  
Review question  We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of xylitol to prevent acute middle ear infection (acute otitis media; AOM) in children up to 12 years old. 
Background  AOM is the most common bacterial infection among young children in the United States. Although serious complications are rare, this common childhood ailment imposes a huge impact on the healthcare system. In the United States, it accounted for almost 20 million office visits. Antibiotic treatment of AOM is costly and raises concerns about the development of antibiotic‐resistant strains of bacteria. Surgery is invasive and costly, and because of these factors, effective measures for preventing AOM are sought. An alternative treatment is xylitol or birch sugar. Xylitol has been used for decades as a natural non‐sugar sweetener principally in chewing gums, confectionery, toothpaste and medicines, and can reduce the risk of tooth decay. 
Search date 
We searched the literature up to January 2016. This is an update of a review that was last published in 2011. 
Study characteristics  We identified five clinical trials that involved 3405 children, mostly from the same research group. Four trials were conducted in Finland and enrolled healthy children (three trials) or children with an acute respiratory infection (one trial). The fifth trial was conducted in the USA and enrolled otitis‐prone children who were recruited from attendance at general medical practices.

All five trials received governmental funding; and the Finnish study investigators have a US patent for the use of xylitol to treat respiratory infections. 
Key results 
Xylitol, administered in chewing gum, lozenges or syrup, can reduce the occurrence of AOM among healthy children with no acute upper respiratory infection from 30% to 22%. There is no difference in side effects (namely, abdominal discomfort and rash). Based on these results we would expect that out of 1000 children up to 12 years of age, 299 would experience an AOM compared with between 194 and 263 children who would experience an AOM if they are provided with xylitol chewing gum. The preventive effect among healthy children with respiratory infection or among otitis‐prone children is inconclusive. 
Quality of the evidence  The quality of evidence was moderate for healthy children and children with respiratory infections but low for otitis‐prone children.","# Plain Language Summary: Can Xylitol Help Prevent Ear Infections in Children?

## What is this study about?

Ear infections are very common in young children in the United States. Doctors often treat them with antibiotics or surgery, but these treatments have drawbacks. This review looked at whether a natural sugar substitute called xylitol might help prevent ear infections instead.

## Who was studied?

Researchers reviewed studies involving 3,405 children aged 12 years and younger. Most of the children studied were healthy and attended daycare centers.

## What did they test?

The studies compared children who received xylitol (in various forms) with children who received a placebo (fake treatment) or no treatment. The goal was to see if xylitol could prevent ear infections.

## What did they find?

**Good news:** In healthy daycare children, xylitol reduced ear infection risk from 30% down to about 22%. This means it helped prevent some infections.

**Not as helpful:** Xylitol did not work well for children who already had respiratory infections (like colds) or for children who got ear infections frequently.

**Safety:** The studies found no major safety concerns. Children taking xylitol did not have more stomach problems or rashes than those taking placebo.

## Bottom line

There is moderate evidence that xylitol can reduce ear infections in healthy children attending daycare. However, more research is needed, especially for children with colds or those prone to frequent ear infections.","### Summary of Clinical Trial on Xylitol to Prevent Ear Infections in Children

**What is the Study About?**

This study looks at whether xylitol, a natural sugar substitute, can help prevent ear infections in children. Ear infections, known as acute otitis media (AOM), are very common in young kids in the U.S. There are concerns about using antibiotics and surgery, so finding a better way to prevent these infections is important.

**Who Was Involved?**

The study focused on children aged 12 years and younger. It included five trials with a total of 3,405 kids. Most of the kids were healthy children attending daycare in Finland.

**What Did They Do?**

Researchers compared the effects of xylitol to a placebo (a fake treatment) or no treatment at all. They wanted to see if xylitol could reduce the number of ear infections.

**What Did They Find?**

- **Effectiveness**: For healthy children in daycare, xylitol reduced the risk of ear infections from 30% to about 22%. This means fewer children got ear infections when using xylitol.
- **Safety**: There were no big differences in side effects like stomach discomfort or rashes between children taking xylitol and those who weren’t.
- **Infections with Colds**: Xylitol didn’t seem to help prevent ear infections in children who already had a cold.
- **Children Who Often Get Ear Infections**: Xylitol wasn’t very effective for children who are more prone to ear infections.

**Conclusion**

The study shows that xylitol might help prevent ear infections in healthy children who go to daycare. However, it may not work as well for children with colds or those who often get ear infections. More research is needed because the studies were mostly done by the same group and involved a small number of children."
"Background
This an update of a Cochrane Review.
Paraquat is a widely used herbicide, but is also a lethal poison. In some low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) paraquat is commonly available and inexpensive, making poisoning prevention difficult. Most of the people poisoned by paraquat have taken it as a means of self‐poisoning. 
Standard treatment for paraquat poisoning prevents further absorption and reduces the load of paraquat in the blood through haemoperfusion or haemodialysis. The effectiveness of standard treatments is extremely limited. 
The immune system plays an important role in exacerbating paraquat‐induced lung fibrosis. Immunosuppressive treatment using glucocorticoid and cyclophosphamide in combination has been developed and studied as an intervention for paraquat poisoning. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of glucocorticoid with cyclophosphamide for moderate to severe oral paraquat poisoning. 
Search methods
The most recent searches were run in September 2020. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Injuries Trials Register), Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE, Embase Classic + Embase (Ovid), ISI WOS (SCI‐EXPANDED, SSCI, CPCI‐S, and CPSI‐SSH), and trials registries. We also searched the following three resources: China National Knowledge Infrastructure database (CNKI 数据库); Wanfang Data (万方数据库); and VIP (维普数据库) on 12 November 2020. We examined the reference lists of included studies and review papers. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). For this update, in accordance with Cochrane Injuries' Group policy (2015), we included only prospectively registered RCTs for trials published after 2010. We included trials which assessed the effects of glucocorticoid with cyclophosphamide delivered in combination. Eligible comparators were standard care (with or without a placebo), or any other therapy in addition to standard care. Outcomes of interest included mortality and infections. 
Data collection and analysis
We calculated the mortality risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Where possible, we summarised data for all‐cause mortality at relevant time periods (from hospital discharge to three months after discharge) in meta‐analysis, using a fixed‐effect model. We conducted sensitivity analyses based on factors including whether participants were assessed at baseline for plasma paraquat levels. We also reported data on infections within one week after initiation of treatment. 
Main results
We included four trials with a total of 463 participants. The included studies were conducted in Taiwan (Republic of China), Iran, and Sri Lanka. Most participants were male. The mean age of participants was 28 years. 
We judged two of the four included studies, including the largest and most recently conducted study (n = 299), to be at low risk of bias for key domains including sequence generation. We assessed one study to be at high risk of selection bias and another at unclear risk, since allocation concealment was either not mentioned in the trial report or explicitly not undertaken. We assessed three of the four studies to be at unclear risk of selective reporting, as no protocols could be identified. An important source of heterogeneity amongst the included studies was the method of assessment of participants' baseline severity using analysis of plasma levels (two studies employed this method, whilst the other two did not). 
No studies assessed the outcome of mortality at 30 days following ingestion of paraquat.
Low‐certainty evidence from two studies indicates that glucocorticoids with cyclophosphamide in addition to standard care may slightly reduce the risk of death in hospital compared to standard care alone ((RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.99; participants = 322); results come from sensitivity analysis excluding studies not assessing plasma at baseline). However, we have limited confidence in this finding as heterogeneity was high (I2 = 77%) and studies varied in terms of size and comparators. A single large study provided data showing that there may be little or no effect of treatment at three months post discharge from hospital (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.13; 1 study, 293 participants; low‐certainty evidence); however, analysis of long‐term results amongst participants whose injuries arose from self‐poisoning must be interpreted with caution. 
We remain uncertain of the effect of glucocorticoids with cyclophosphamide on infection within one week after initiation of the treatment; this outcome was assessed by two small studies only (31 participants, very low‐certainty evidence) that considered leukopenia as a proxy or risk factor for infection. Neither study reported infections in any participants. 
Authors' conclusions
Low‐certainly evidence suggests that glucocorticoids with cyclophosphamide in addition to standard care may slightly reduce mortality in hospitalised people with oral paraquat poisoning. However, we have limited confidence in this finding because of substantial heterogeneity and concerns about imprecision. Glucocorticoids with cyclophosphamide in addition to standard care may have little or no effect on mortality at three months after hospital discharge. We are uncertain whether glucocorticoid with cyclophosphamide puts patients at an increased risk of infection due to the limited evidence available for this outcome. Future research should be prospectively registered and CONSORT‐compliant. Investigators should attempt to ensure an adequate sample size, screen participants for inclusion rigorously, and seek long‐term follow‐up of participants. Investigators may wish to research the effects of glucocorticoid in combination with other treatments.","What are the benefits and risks of treating paraquat poisoning with a combination of steroids and cyclophosphamide (an anti‐cancer medicine)? 
Key messages 
‐ Steroids given with cyclophosphamide (an anti‐cancer medicine) are unlikely to reduce the risk of death after paraquat poisoning in the short term, or at three months after hospital discharge. 
‐ We are uncertain whether these medicines increase the risk of infection.
‐ Future studies need to be larger, measure the level of paraquat poisoning of patients accurately, and monitor patients in the long term. Research into steroids combined with other treatments could be useful. 
What happens in people with paraquat poisoning? 
Paraquat is used as a herbicide, but is also a deadly poison. Most people who are poisoned by paraquat have taken it as a means of self‐poisoning. 
Treatment for paraquat poisoning focuses on the physical removal (via stomach pumping and other methods) of as much paraquat as possible from the person's digestive system (stomach) and blood. Any paraquat that remains inside the body causes inflammation that can damage the lungs severely and lead to death. 
Steroids and cyclophosphamide (a medicine normally used in cancer treatment) are medicines that fight inflammation and so are also used to treat paraquat poisoning. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if a combination of steroids and cyclophosphamide (plus usual care) works better than usual care alone to reduce the number of people who die from paraquat poisoning. 
We also wanted to find out if treatment with steroids plus cyclophosphamide causes an increased number of infections in patients. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that investigated the use of steroids and cyclophosphamide (plus usual care) compared with usual care alone in people poisoned with paraquat. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found four studies that involved 463 people with confirmed paraquat poisoning. Two studies were conducted in Taiwan (Republic of China), one in Iran, and one in Sri Lanka. 
All participants were given either:
‐ usual care only, or
‐ steroids (methylprednisolone alone, or with dexamethasone) plus cyclophosphamide, as well as usual care. Cyclophosphamide was given before the steroid(s) or at the same time as them. 
Two of the studies measured the severity of poisoning by testing patients’ plasma (a component of blood) at the start of the study. Plasma tests provide the best assessment of how seriously a person is affected by paraquat poisoning. 
One study used a placebo (sham) treatment in addition to usual care. Two studies gave patients a steroid (dexamethasone) as part of the usual care. 
Death while in hospital 
The combined results of two studies showed that steroids plus cyclophosphamide (plus usual care) may slightly reduce the risk of death compared to usual care alone (with, or without, placebo) in people with paraquat poisoning. 
Death 3 months after hospital discharge 
One large study showed that at 3 months after discharge from hospital there may be no difference in the number of deaths between the people treated with steroids plus cyclophosphamide (plus usual care) and those treated with usual care alone. 
Infection 
Two small studies checked levels of white blood cells in patients (low levels can increase risk of infection). Neither study reported any infections in the week following treatment with steroids and cyclophosphamide. Due to the small size of the studies, we are very uncertain about whether the treatment affects the risk of infection within one week of treatment. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
The four studies differed in terms of the number of people in them, assessment of level of paraquat poisoning, and types of treatment. This limited our ability to draw firm conclusions from the evidence. 
Overall, the studies we found were too small to provide answers to our questions.
How up to date is this evidence? 
This review updates our previous review on this subject. The evidence is up to date to September 2020.","# Plain Language Summary: Treatment for Paraquat Poisoning

## What is this about?
This review looks at whether a combination of two medicines—glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide—can help people who have swallowed paraquat (a poison found in some weed killers).

## Background
Paraquat is a chemical used to kill weeds, but it is very poisonous if swallowed. In some countries, it is cheap and easy to get, which makes accidental or intentional poisoning a serious problem. When someone swallows paraquat, doctors try to stop their body from absorbing it and remove it from the blood. However, these standard treatments don't work very well.

Scientists think that the body's immune system makes paraquat poisoning worse, especially in the lungs. Researchers have tested whether giving medicines that calm down the immune system (glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide together) might help.

## What did researchers want to find out?
The researchers wanted to know if giving glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide together—along with standard care—helps people survive paraquat poisoning better than standard care alone.

## What did they find?
The researchers looked at 4 studies involving 463 people (mostly men, average age 28 years) from Taiwan, Iran, and Sri Lanka.

**Main findings:**
- **In the hospital:** The combination medicine may slightly lower the chance of death compared to standard care alone, but the researchers are not very confident in this finding.
- **Three months after leaving the hospital:** The combination medicine appeared to have little or no effect on survival.
- **Infections:** There was not enough information to know if the combination medicine increased infection risk.

## Bottom line
Low-quality evidence suggests the combination medicine might help a little while people are in the hospital, but researchers are uncertain about the results. More and better research is needed.","### Plain-Language Summary

**Why is This Study Important?**

This study looks at a chemical called paraquat, which is used to kill weeds but can be deadly if consumed. It's often easy to get and cheap in some countries, making it a problem when people try to poison themselves with it. Usual treatments for paraquat poisoning don’t work very well.

**What Did the Researchers Want to Find Out?**

The researchers wanted to see if using two medicines together, called glucocorticoid and cyclophosphamide, could help people who have swallowed paraquat and are seriously ill.

**How Was the Research Done?**

The researchers looked at past studies where people were given these two medicines alongside standard treatments. They checked how these treatments affected survival rates and whether they increased the risk of infections.

**Who Participated in the Studies?**

The studies included 463 people from Taiwan, Iran, and Sri Lanka. Most were men, and the average age was 28 years.

**What Did They Find Out?**

1. **Survival in the Hospital:** There is some evidence that these medicines might slightly help more people survive while still in the hospital.
   
2. **Survival After Leaving the Hospital:** The medicines may not make a big difference once people have been out of the hospital for a few months.
   
3. **Risk of Infection:** It’s unclear whether these medicines increase the chance of infections shortly after starting treatment. More research is needed on this.

**What Are the Conclusions?**

The medicines might help a little in the hospital, but they probably don’t have much effect once a person has gone home. The risk of getting infections is not well understood yet. More studies are needed to be sure about these results, and future research should include careful planning and follow-up."
"Background
Cystic fibrosis is the most common life‐limiting autosomal recessive genetic disorder in white populations. Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) is an important morbidity in cystic fibrosis. It is the result of the accumulation of viscid faecal material within the bowel which combines with thick, sticky mucus produced in the intestines of people with cystic fibrosis. The intestine may be completely blocked (complete DIOS) or only partially blocked (incomplete DIOS). Once a diagnosis of DIOS has been made, the goal of therapy is to relieve the acute complete or incomplete faecal obstruction and ultimately prevent the need for surgical intervention. 
Objectives
This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different treatment regimens for the treatment of DIOS (complete and incomplete) in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of search: 09 September 2021. 
We also searched online trial registries. Date of last search: 12 October 2021.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials, quasi‐randomised controlled trials (including cross‐over trials (to be judged on an individual basis)) comparing the use of laxative agents or surgery for treating DIOS in children, young people and adults with cystic fibrosis to each other, placebo or no intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed for risk of bias. The authors assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
There was one trial with 20 participants (16 females) included in the review. The mean age of participants was 13.1 years. The trial was a double‐blinded, randomised cross‐over trial which had a duration of 12 months in total and compared high‐dose and low‐dose pancreatic enzyme therapy. As only the abstract of the trial was available, the overall risk of bias was judged to be unclear. The trial did not address either of our primary outcomes (time until resolution of DIOS and treatment failure rate), but reported episodes of acute DIOS, presence of abdominal mass and abdominal pain. There were no numerical data available for these outcomes, but the authors stated that there was no difference between treatment with high‐dose or low‐dose pancreatic enzymes. The overall certainty of the evidence was found to be very low. 
Authors' conclusions
There is a clear lack of evidence for the treatment of DIOS in people with cystic fibrosis. The included abstract did not address our primary outcome measures and did not provide numerical data for the two secondary outcomes it did address. Therefore, we cannot justify the use of high‐dose pancreatic enzymes for treating DIOS, nor can we comment on the efficacy and safety of other laxative agents. From our findings, it is clear that more randomised controlled trials need to be conducted in this area.","Interventions for treating distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) in cystic fibrosis 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of different treatments for distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
Cystic fibrosis is a common, life‐limiting, inherited disease. One of the main features of cystic fibrosis is the thick, sticky mucus produced by many organs including the lungs, pancreas and intestine. DIOS occurs when mucus in the intestine combines with faeces and builds up to produce a mass. This mass can partially or completely block the intestine and cause symptoms such as vomiting, severe abdominal pain and a swollen stomach (abdominal distension). Once a diagnosis of DIOS has been made, the goal of therapy is to relieve the complete or partial blockage and ultimately prevent the need for any surgical intervention. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 12 October 2021.
Trial characteristics 
The review included one trial with 20 people with cystic fibrosis who were aged between 7.1 and 23.2 years of age (average 13.1 years old). The 12‐month trial compared a high dose of pancreatic enzymes with a low dose of pancreatic enzymes for treating chronic DIOS. 
Key results 
The trial did not report on our primary outcomes (time until DIOS successfully treated and treatment failure rate), but addressed two of our secondary outcomes; episodes of acute DIOS and the harmful effects that might occur in participants (the presence of an abdominal mass and abdominal pain). There were no numerical data available for these results, but the authors reported that there was no difference between high‐dose or low‐dose pancreatic enzymes. 
Certainty of the evidence 
We found the overall certainty of the evidence to be very low. The trial itself was only published as an abstract from a conference which did not include numerical data and it was not published as a full report. This meant that we do not know many details about the trial. We thought that the overall risk of bias was unclear, as the trial authors did not describe how participants were put into the treatment groups, whether any participants dropped out or whether the planned outcomes were the same as the reported outcomes. The trial also had a very small number of participants and a limited age range, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relevance of the treatment for all people with cystic fibrosis.","# Plain Language Summary: Treatment for Bowel Blockages in Cystic Fibrosis

## What is this study about?

This review looked at different treatments for a bowel blockage problem that affects people with cystic fibrosis. The blockage happens when thick, sticky material builds up in the intestines and gets stuck.

## Why is this important?

People with cystic fibrosis produce thick, sticky mucus in their intestines. Sometimes this mucus mixes with stool and completely or partially blocks the bowel. When this happens, doctors need to treat it quickly to avoid surgery.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for studies that tested different medicines or treatments to help clear these blockages. They looked for studies that compared:
- Different types of laxatives (medicines that help with bowel movements)
- Surgery
- Placebo (fake medicine)
- No treatment

## What did they find?

The researchers found only **one study** with 20 people (mostly girls and women), with an average age of 13 years old. This study:
- Lasted 12 months
- Compared two different doses of pancreatic enzyme medicine
- Found **no difference** between the high dose and low dose

The study did not provide enough information to say whether the treatment actually worked.

## Bottom line

There is **not enough evidence** to know which treatments work best for this bowel blockage problem. More research studies are needed.","### Summary of Clinical Trial on DIOS and Cystic Fibrosis

**What is the Study About?**
This study looks at treatments for a condition called Distal Intestinal Obstruction Syndrome (DIOS) in people with cystic fibrosis. DIOS happens when sticky poop builds up and blocks the intestines. The study's goal is to see which treatments work best and are safe.

**Who Was in the Study?**
The study included 20 participants, mostly females, with an average age of about 13 years. These participants all have cystic fibrosis and were experiencing DIOS.

**What Did the Study Test?**
The study compared two different doses of pancreatic enzyme therapy to see if one was better at dealing with DIOS. It was done in a special way where neither the doctors nor the participants knew which dose they were getting, and the same participants tried both doses over a year.

**What Did They Find?**
The study found no clear difference between using high doses and low doses of pancreatic enzymes. However, it did not measure everything the researchers were interested in, like how long it took for DIOS to get better. The information we have is not very certain because they only shared limited details.

**Conclusion**
There's not enough evidence to say for sure which treatment is best for DIOS. More studies are needed to find out what works and is safe for people with cystic fibrosis."
"Background
Lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated pathological spinal conditions. It frequently afflicts the elderly population. 
Objectives
To systematically review the evidence for the effectiveness of nonoperative treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication. 
Search methods
CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Index to Chiropractic Literature (ICL) databases were searched up to June 2012. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials published in English, in which at least one arm provided data on nonoperative treatments 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Risk of bias in each study was independently assessed by two review authors using the 12 criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (Furlan 2009). Dichotomous outcomes were expressed as relative risk, continuous outcomes as mean difference or standardized mean difference; uncertainty was expressed with 95% confidence intervals. If possible a meta‐analysis was performed, otherwise results were described qualitatively. GRADE was used to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
From the 8635 citations screened, 56 full‐text articles were assessed and 21 trials (1851 participants) were included. There was very low‐quality evidence from six trials that calcitonin is no better than placebo or paracetamol, regardless of mode of administration or outcome assessed. From single small trials, there was low‐quality evidence for prostaglandins, and very low‐quality evidence for gabapentin or methylcobalamin that they improved walking distance. There was very low‐quality evidence from a single trial that epidural steroid injections improved pain, function, and quality of life, up to two weeks, compared with home exercise or inpatient physical therapy. There was low‐quality evidence from a single trial that exercise is of short‐term benefit for leg pain and function compared with no treatment. There was low and very low‐quality evidence from six trials that multimodal nonoperative treatment is less effective than indirect or direct surgical decompression with or without fusion. A meta‐analysis of two trials comparing direct decompression with or without fusion to multimodal nonoperative care found no significant difference in function at six months (mean difference (MD) ‐3.66, 95% CI ‐10.12 to 2.80) and one year (MD ‐6.18, 95% CI ‐15.03 to 2.66), but at 24 months a significant difference was found favouring decompression (MD ‐4.43, 95% CI ‐7.91 to ‐0.96). 
Authors' conclusions
Moderate and high‐quality evidence for nonoperative treatment is lacking and thus prohibits recommendations for guiding clinical practice. Given the expected exponential rise in the prevalence of lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication, large high‐quality trials are urgently needed.","Non‐surgical treatment for spinal stenosis with leg pain
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of non‐surgical treatments for people with leg pain caused by pressure on the nerves in the spine. 
Background 
If the spinal canal becomes narrow and presses on nerves (spinal stenosis) it can cause pain in the legs or buttocks (neurogenic claudication). Spinal stenosis is treated with a variety of non‐surgical methods, including painkillers and other medications, injections into the spine, exercise, physiotherapy and similar treatments. We wanted to discover whether using non‐surgical methods was better or worse than other alternatives. 
Study characteristics 
We included 21 randomised controlled trials that compared non‐surgical treatments to placebo, no treatment, or to surgery. All the participants had leg pain and a confirmed diagnosis of lumbar stenosis. There were 1851 people, with an average age of 50 years, equally divided between men and women. The follow‐up time ranged from one week to six years. The evidence was current to June 2012. 
Key results 
Overall, the review suggests that surgery is more effective at relieving pain than non‐surgical treatments. 
Medicines taken by mouth. One small trial each of prostaglandins (compared to another medicine), gabapentin (compared to placebo), and vitamin B1 (compared to a variety of treatments) suggested improvements in pain and walking distance. Some digestive problems were reported with both medicines in the prostaglandins trial; and some people in the gabapentin trial reported dizziness or sleepiness. 
Epidural injections. Two small trials showed short‐term improvements in pain and quality of life (up to two weeks) and two showed no difference compared with placebo injections. No trial reported bad reactions or problems. 
Calcitonin injections. Six small trials indicated that calcitonin is no better than paracetemol or placebo. A number of people reported feeling sick or developed a rash. 
Mixed approaches compared to surgery. Five trials compared results from surgery with results from a variety of non‐surgical treatments. One trial found that after two years there was no difference between treatments as far as pain was concerned. The other four found that surgery improved pain more than non‐surgical treatments over different time periods, but not necessarily walking ability. Between 5% and 18% suffered unwanted side effects from surgery, some serious. 
Physical therapy. Four small trials, all including some form of exercise, failed to demonstrate improved walking ability after physical therapy. One trial each suggested that exercise is better than no treatment for leg pain, and that treadmill walking and stationary cycling produce similar, limited results. 
Quality of evidence 
The findings of all the trials in this study were based on low or very low‐quality evidence. The studies were poorly designed, or they failed to give enough information about what was done. This means that we cannot be confident that the findings are reliable, and further research may well come to a different conclusion.","# Plain Language Summary: Treatments for Lower Back Narrowing

## What is this study about?

This study looked at research on treatments that don't involve surgery for a common back problem in older adults. This problem happens when the space in the lower spine gets narrow and pinches nerves, causing leg pain and trouble walking.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched medical databases for studies testing non-surgical treatments. They found 21 studies with about 1,850 people total. They compared different treatments to see which ones worked best.

## What treatments were tested?

- Medicines (calcitonin, prostaglandins, gabapentin, methylcobalamin)
- Steroid shots into the spine
- Exercise and physical therapy
- Combinations of treatments
- Surgery (for comparison)

## What did they find?

**Medicines:** Most medicines didn't work better than fake pills or common pain relievers. A few showed small benefits for walking distance, but the evidence was weak.

**Injections:** One small study found steroid injections helped pain and function for up to two weeks.

**Exercise:** Limited evidence showed exercise helped leg pain and function in the short term.

**Surgery vs. Non-surgical treatments:** Surgery worked better than non-surgical treatments after 2 years, but there was no clear difference at 6 months or 1 year.

## Main conclusion

There isn't enough good-quality research to say which non-surgical treatment works best. Doctors need more large, well-designed studies to guide treatment choices.","### Plain Language Summary

**Why is this important?**
Understanding better ways to treat this condition without surgery could help many people, especially as the number of older adults increases."
"Background
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a distressing and common neurological disorder that may have a huge impact in the quality of life of those with frequent and intense symptoms. Patients complain of unpleasant sensations in the legs, at or before bedtime, and feel an urge to move the legs, which improves with movement, such as walking. Symptoms start with the patient at rest (e.g. sitting or lying down), and follow a circadian pattern, increasing during the evening or at night. Many pharmacological intervention are available for RLS, including drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease (L‐Dopa and dopaminergic agonists), epilepsy (anticonvulsants), anxiety (benzodiazepines), and pain (opioids). Dopaminergic drugs are those most frequently used for treatment of RLS, but some patients do not respond effectively and require other medication. Opioids, a class of medications used to treat severe pain, seem to be effective in treating RLS symptoms, and are recommended for patients with severe symptoms, because RLS and pain appear to share the same mechanism in the central nervous system. All available drugs are associated to some degree with side effects, which can impede treatment. Opioids are associated with adverse events such as constipation, tolerance, and dependence. This justifies the conduct of a systematic review to ascertain whether opioids are safe and effective for treatment of RLS. 
Objectives
To asses the effects of opioids compared to placebo treatment for restless legs syndrome in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials, CENTRAL 2016, issue 4 and MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS up to April 2016, using a search strategy adapted by Cochraneto identify randomised clinical trials. We checked the references of each study and established personal communication with other authors to identify any additional studies. We considered publications in all languages. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled clinical trials of opioid treatment in adults with idiopathic RLS. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened articles, independently extracted data into a standard form, and assessed for risk of bias. If necessary, they discussed discrepancies with a third researcher to resolve any doubts. 
Main results
We included one randomised clinical trial (N = 304 randomised; 204 completed; 276 analysed) that evaluated opioids (prolonged release oxycodone/naloxone) versus placebo. After 12 weeks, RSL symptoms had improved more in the drug group than in the placebo group (using the IRLSSS: MD ‐7.0; 95% CI ‐9.69 to ‐4.31 and the CGI: MD ‐1.11; 95% CI ‐1.49 to ‐0.73). More patients in the drug group than in the placebo group were drug responders (using the IRLSSS: RR 1.82; 95% CI 1.37 to 2.42 and the CGI: RR1.92; 95% ICI 1.49 to 2.48). The proportion of remitters was greater in the drug group than in the placebo group (using the IRLSSS: RR 2.14; 95% CI 1.45 to 3.16). Quality of life scores also improved more in the drug group than in the placebo group (MD ‐0.73; 95% CI ‐1.1 to ‐0.36). Quality of sleep was improved more in the drug group measured by sleep adequacy (MD ‐0.74; 95% CI ‐1.15 to ‐0.33), and sleep quantity (MD 0.89; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.26). 
There was no difference between groups for daytime somnolence, trouble staying awake during the day, or naps during the day. More adverse events were reported in the drug group (RR 1.22; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.39). The major adverse events were gastrointestinal problems, fatigue, and headache. 
Authors' conclusions
Opioids seem to be effective for treating RLS symptoms, but there are no definitive data regarding the important problem of safety. This conclusion is based on only one study with a high dropout rate (low quality evidence).","Opiods for restless legs syndrome
Background 
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a very common neurological disorder in which patients complain of an intense need to move their legs, and unpleasant sensations felt deep in their legs, all occurring while at rest, mostly at bedtime. The number of patients complaining of RLS varies according to race, gender, age, country, and health status. About 5% to 10% of people are affected; , and, among these, 2% to 5% need continual pharmacological treatment (medication). When RLS does not respond to medications generally used for Parkinsons Disease and epilepsy, their doctors often prescribe opioids. 
Question 
Are opioids effective and safe for people with RLS?
Methods 
We searched the literature for studies in any language, published or not, that considered opioids for the treatment of RLS 
Results 
We included one randomised controlled clinical trial with moderate risk of bias that tested a combination of oxycodone and naloxone against placebo capsules, taken twice daily in participants whodid not respond to more usual medications. Researchers used the International RLS severity scale to find out if patients were improved after 12 weeks of treatment. Particpants receiving the combined oxycodone and naloxone reported improvement in RLS symptoms, Quality of life, and sleep quality; 42% of the drug group were symptom‐free. 
Discussion 
The study was well designed overall, but was at a high risk of bias due to the high percentage of participants who withdrew from treatment (attrition bias). Eighty‐four percent of the drug group developed adverse events, which were mostly related to the gastrointestinal system, headache, fatigue, and sleepiness (somnolence); 9.8% left the study because of the adverse events. 
Conclusion 
The use of opioids for the treatment of RLS in patients resistant to conventional treatment is supported by low‐quality evidence. Prescription of these medications should be based on clinical experience, and caution used due to the potential for abuse, dependency, and adverse events. No patient on opioids complained that their symptoms worsened.","# Plain Language Summary: Opioids for Restless Legs Syndrome

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether opioid medicines (strong pain medications) work to treat restless legs syndrome (RLS) and whether they are safe.

## What is restless legs syndrome?

RLS is a condition where people feel uncomfortable sensations in their legs, usually when sitting or lying down, especially in the evening or at night. People with RLS have a strong urge to move their legs, and moving them makes the uncomfortable feeling better. This can make it hard to sleep and affect daily life.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for studies that tested opioid medicines against placebo (fake medicine) in adults with RLS. They found one study with 304 people that lasted 12 weeks.

## What were the results?

**How well the medicine worked:**
- People taking opioids had more improvement in RLS symptoms than those taking placebo
- More people in the opioid group felt better
- More people in the opioid group had their symptoms go away completely
- Quality of life improved more in the opioid group
- Sleep improved more in the opioid group

**Side effects:**
- More people in the opioid group reported side effects
- Common side effects included stomach problems, tiredness, and headaches
- There was no difference between groups in daytime sleepiness

## What do the researchers conclude?

Opioids appear to help treat RLS symptoms. However, researchers say we need more information about safety because this conclusion is based on only one study, and many people dropped out of it.","### Summary of the Clinical Trial on Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)

**What was the study about?**
This study looked at how well a type of medicine called opioids works for adults with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). RLS makes people feel uncomfortable sensations in their legs, often before bedtime, and they feel better when they move around.

**Who was involved?**
The study involved adults with RLS. They tested a specific opioid medicine (oxycodone/naloxone) against a placebo (a fake treatment).

**What did they do?**
Researchers gave some people the opioid medicine and others a placebo for 12 weeks. They wanted to see if the medicine helped more than the placebo.

**What did they find?**
- People taking the medicine had more improvement in their RLS symptoms compared to those taking the placebo.
- Those on the medicine showed better quality of life and sleep.
- There was no difference in feeling sleepy during the day between the two groups.
- Some people on the medicine experienced side effects like stomach issues, tiredness, and headaches.

**Safety and Other Observations**
- More side effects were reported by those taking the medicine.
- There is still not enough information to say how safe opioids are for RLS.

**Conclusion**
Opioids may help with RLS symptoms, but safety is still a concern and more research is needed. This conclusion is based on one study, and more information is needed to be sure."
"Background
Antenatal day care units have been widely used as an alternative to inpatient care for women with pregnancy complications including mild and moderate hypertension, and preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes. 
Objectives
The objective of this review is to compare day care units with routine care or hospital admission for women with pregnancy complications in terms of maternal and perinatal outcomes, length of hospital stay, acceptability, and costs to women and health services providers. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (February 2009). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing day care with inpatient or routine care for women with complicated pregnancy. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently carried out data extraction and assessed studies for risk of bias. 
Main results
Three trials with a total of 504 women were included. For most outcomes it was not possible to pool results from trials in meta‐analyses as outcomes were measured in different ways. 
Compared with women in the ward/routine care group, women attending day care units were less likely to be admitted to hospital overnight (risk ratio 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.62). The average length of antenatal admission was shorter for women attending for day care, although outpatient attendances were increased for this group. There was evidence from one study that women attending for day care were significantly less likely to undergo induction of labour, but mode of birth was similar for women in both groups. For other outcomes there were no significant differences between groups.The evidence regarding the costs of different types of care was mixed; while the length of antenatal hospital stays were reduced, this did not necessarily translate into reduced health service costs. 
While most women tended to be satisfied with whatever care they received, women preferred day care compared with hospital admission. 
Authors' conclusions
Small studies suggest that there are no major differences in clinical outcomes for mothers or babies between antenatal day units or hospital admission, but women may prefer day care.","Antenatal day care units versus hospital admission for women with pregnancy complications
Many women experience complications during pregnancy such as high blood pressure, threatened early labour or abnormal and heavy bleeding (haemorrhage). Admission to hospital may be necessary but can be disruptive to the mother and her family. Often tests and monitoring are needed so that the condition of the mother and baby can be assessed and treatment can be provided. Sometimes this care can be given in day care units to avoid the need for an overnight stay in hospital. The review compares day care units with hospital admission or routine care. Three trials, involving 504 pregnant women with high blood pressure or preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes, were included in the review. The findings were that women receiving day care had to make more visits to hospital as outpatients but were less likely to stay in hospital overnight. Care in day units did not seem to affect other outcomes for mothers and babies or increase or reduce interventions in labour; although women in one trial were less likely to have their labours induced if they received day care. Two studies provided evidence that women preferred day care to hospital admission and no women expressed a preference for more inpatient care; most women in both groups felt they had received good care and were satisfied with it. 
The aim of antenatal care is to reduce adverse outcomes for mothers and babies but these are relatively infrequent and could not be investigated in this review. A proportion of women attending for day care require subsequent inpatient care, and a range of non‐medical considerations such as travelling distance to emergency facilities, social factors and women's emotional wellbeing may lead to admission to hospital. All studies included in the review were carried out as part of evaluations of new services.","# Plain Language Summary: Antenatal Day Care Units for Pregnancy Complications

## What is this study about?
This review looked at whether pregnant women with complications can be safely cared for at special day care units instead of staying overnight in the hospital.

## Who was studied?
The review included 504 pregnant women with pregnancy complications, such as high blood pressure or other concerns.

## What was compared?
Researchers compared two types of care:
- **Day care units**: Women visit during the day for monitoring and treatment, then go home
- **Hospital admission**: Women stay overnight in the hospital

## What did researchers find?

**Hospital stays:**
- Women using day care units were much less likely to stay overnight in the hospital
- Overall time spent in the hospital was shorter for day care patients
- However, these women had more outpatient visits (extra appointments)

**Birth outcomes:**
- Women in day care were less likely to have labor induced (started artificially)
- The way babies were born (vaginal or cesarean) was similar in both groups
- Baby and mother health outcomes were similar between the two groups

**What women preferred:**
- Most women were satisfied with whichever type of care they received
- Women preferred day care compared with staying in the hospital

**Costs:**
- Results were mixed—while hospital stays were shorter with day care, this didn't always save money overall

## Bottom line
Day care units appear to be a safe option for pregnant women with certain complications, with similar health outcomes to hospital care. Women tend to prefer day care when given the choice.","### Plain Language Summary

This research looked at a special type of care for pregnant women called ""antenatal day care"" compared to staying in the hospital. Antenatal day care might be a choice for women with certain pregnancy issues, like mild and moderate high blood pressure or water breaking early.

**Objective:**
The study wanted to see if antenatal day care is as good as hospital stays for both moms and babies. It also looked at how long women stayed in the hospital, how they felt about the care, and the costs.

**Who Participated:**
The study included 504 pregnant women with complications.

**What They Did:**
The researchers compared women who went to day care units with those who stayed in the hospital. They looked at different outcomes like how long the women stayed in the hospital and if they liked the care they got.

**Main Findings:**
- Women who went to day care were less likely to stay overnight in the hospital.
- Their hospital stays were usually shorter, but they had more visits to the outpatient clinic.
- There was some evidence that women in day care were less likely to need labor induction, but both groups had similar types of births.
- There wasn’t a big difference in the health costs between day care and hospital stays.
- Most women liked day care better than staying in the hospital.

**Conclusion:**
There are no big differences in health outcomes for moms and babies whether care is given in day care units or in a hospital. However, many women seem to prefer the day care option."
"Background
Despite the availability of effective drug therapies that reduce low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)‐cholesterol (LDL‐C), cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity. Therefore, additional LDL‐C reduction may be warranted, especially for people who are unresponsive to, or unable to take, existing LDL‐C‐reducing therapies. By inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) enzyme, monoclonal antibodies (PCSK9 inhibitors) reduce LDL‐C and CVD risk. 
Objectives
Primary 
To quantify the effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on CVD, all‐cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke, compared to placebo or active treatment(s) for primary and secondary prevention. 
Secondary 
To quantify the safety of PCSK9 inhibitors, with specific focus on the incidence of influenza, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and cancer, compared to placebo or active treatment(s) for primary and secondary prevention. 
Search methods
We identified studies by systematically searching CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science in December 2019. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform in August 2020 and screened the reference lists of included studies. This is an update of the review first published in 2017. 
Selection criteria
All parallel‐group and factorial randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow‐up of at least 24 weeks and adult participants with or without a history of CVD were eligible if they compared PCSK9 inhibitors alirocumab or evolocumab to placebo or active treatments such as statins, ezetimibe, or a combination of these. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently reviewed and extracted data. Where data were available, we calculated pooled effect estimates. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence and in 'Summary of findings' tables. 
Main results
We included 24 studies with data on 60,997 participants. Eighteen trials randomised participants to alirocumab and six to evolocumab. All participants received background lipid‐lowering treatment or lifestyle counselling. Six alirocumab studies used  an active treatment comparison group (the remaining used placebo), compared to three evolocumab active comparison trials. Follow‐up ranged from 6 to 36 months for the comparisons with placebo and from 6 to 12 months for comparisons with active treatment. Most of the available studies preferentially enrolled people with either established CVD or at a high risk already, and evidence in low‐ to medium‐risk settings is minimal. 
Alirocumab compared with placebo decreased the risk of CVD events, with an absolute risk difference (RD) of –2% (odds ratio (OR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 0.94; 10 studies, 23,868 participants; high‐certainty evidence), decreased the risk of mortality (RD –1%; OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.96; 12 studies, 24,797 participants; high‐certainty evidence), and MI (RD –2%; OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.94; 9 studies, 23,352 participants; high‐certainty evidence) and for any stroke (RD 0%; OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.91; 8 studies, 22,835 participants; high‐certainty evidence). 
Alirocumab compared with ezetimibe and statins: for CVD, the RD was 1% (OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.87; 3 studies, 1379 participants; low‐certainty evidence); for mortality, RD was –1% (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.40; 5 studies, 1333 participants; low‐certainty evidence); for MI, RD was 1% (OR 1.45, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.28, 5 studies, 1734 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and for any stroke, RD was less than 1% (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.13 to 5.61; 5 studies, 1734 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Evolocumab compared with placebo: for CVD, the RD was –2% (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.91; 3 studies, 29,432 participants; high‐certainty evidence); for mortality, RD was less than 1% (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.19; 3 studies, 29,432 participants; high‐certainty evidence); for MI, RD was –1% (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.82; 3 studies, 29,432 participants; high‐certainty evidence); and for any stroke RD was less than –1% (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.94; 2 studies, 28,531 participants; high‐certainty evidence).  
Evolocumab compared with ezetimibe and statins: for any CVD event RD was less than –1% (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.14 to 3.04; 1 study, 218 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); for all‐cause mortality, the RD was less than 1% (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.30; 3 studies, 5223 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); and for MI, RD was less than 1% (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.85; 3 studies, 5003 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There were insufficient data on any stroke.  
Authors' conclusions
The evidence for the clinical endpoint effects of  evolocumab and alirocumab versus placebo were graded as high. There is a strong evidence base for the benefits of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies to people who might not be eligible for other lipid‐lowering drugs, or to people who cannot meet their lipid goals on more traditional therapies, which was the main patient population of the available trials.  
The evidence base of PCSK9 inhibitors compared with ezetimibe and statins is much weaker (low very‐ to low‐certainty evidence) and it is unclear whether evolocumab or alirocumab might be effectively used as replacement therapies.  
Finally, there is very limited evidence on any potential safety issues of both evolocumab and alirocumab. While the current evidence synthesis does not reveal any adverse signals, neither does it provide evidence against such signals. This suggests careful consideration of alternative lipid lowering treatments before prescribing PCSK9 inhibitors.","PCSK9 inhibitors for prevention of cardiovascular disease
Research question 
What is the effectiveness and safety of PCSK9 inhibitors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention? 
Background 
Despite the availability of effective medicines (such as statins (which works by blocking a substance your body needs to make cholesterol) or ezetimibe (which stops your body taking in cholesterol from food), or both) that reduce low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL‐C) (sometimes called 'bad' cholesterol), CVD remains an important cause of death and illness. Additional LDL‐C reduction may be needed, especially for people who are unresponsive to, or are unable to use, existing LDL‐C‐reducing therapies. Medicines called PCSK9 inhibitors are another way of lowering LDL‐C and CVD risk. 
Study characteristics 
Review authors identified 23 studies that evaluated the effects of the PCSK9 inhibitors, alirocumab and evolocumab, in people at high risk of CVD. Studies were conducted in outpatient clinics. Review authors identified the studies included in this review through electronic literature searches conducted up to December 2019. This is an update of the review first published in 2017. 
Key results 
Both alirocumab and evolocumab decreased the risk of CVD when added to other LDL‐C‐lowering medicines (e.g. statins or ezetimibe). Alirocumab additionally showed a decrease in death from any cause; with insufficient evidence for evolocumab. Limited data, often of lower quality, was available comparing these PCSK9 inhibitors against other LDL‐C‐lowering drugs. Differences in risk between people treated with and without PCSK9 inhibitors suggest the absolute treatment benefit will likely be modest (e.g. less than 1% change in risk). 
Quality of evidence 
We found high‐quality evidence when adding PCSK9 inhibitors to existing LDL‐C‐lowering treatments and low‐ to very low‐quality evidence when replacing existing LDL‐C‐reducing medicines with PCSK9 inhibitors.","# Plain Language Summary: PCSK9 Inhibitors for Heart and Blood Vessel Disease

## What is this study about?

This review looked at two medicines called alirocumab and evolocumab. These drugs help lower cholesterol in the blood. Researchers wanted to know if these medicines help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and death better than other treatments or fake pills (placebo).

## Why does this matter?

Even though other cholesterol medicines exist, heart disease is still a major health problem. Some people can't take regular cholesterol medicines or don't get enough benefit from them. This review examined whether these newer medicines could help those people.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched medical databases and found 24 studies involving almost 61,000 people. They compared:
- **Alirocumab** (18 studies) versus placebo or other cholesterol medicines
- **Evolocumab** (6 studies) versus placebo or other cholesterol medicines

Most studies lasted 6 to 36 months. Most participants already had heart disease or were at high risk for it.

## Main findings

**Alirocumab vs. placebo:**
- Reduced heart disease events by about 2%
- Reduced death risk by about 1%
- Reduced heart attacks by about 2%
- Reduced strokes by a small amount

**Evolocumab vs. placebo:**
- Reduced heart disease events by about 2%
- Reduced heart attacks by about 1%
- Reduced strokes by a small amount
- No clear effect on death risk

**Compared to other cholesterol medicines:**
- Results were unclear and less reliable
- Not enough evidence to say if these newer drugs work better than traditional medicines

## Safety

The review found very limited safety information. No major safety problems were reported, but researchers couldn't rule out potential risks either.

## Bottom line

These medicines appear to help people who can't take or don't benefit from standard cholesterol drugs. More research is needed to compare them directly to other cholesterol medicines and to better understand safety.","### Summary of Clinical Trial on PCSK9 Inhibitors

#### What was the study about?
This study looked at special medicines called PCSK9 inhibitors. These medicines help lower a type of bad cholesterol called LDL-C, which can cause heart problems.

#### Who participated?
The study included adults with or without a history of heart issues. A total of 60,997 participants were involved in the trials.

#### What were the treatments?
Participants received either PCSK9 inhibitors (alirocumab or evolocumab) or other treatments like placebo, statins, or ezetimibe. Everyone got advice on healthy living or other cholesterol-lowering treatments.

#### What were the researchers trying to find out?
1. **Primary Goal:** To see how well PCSK9 inhibitors reduce heart problems, death from any cause, heart attacks, and strokes.
2. **Secondary Goal:** To check the safety of PCSK9 inhibitors, like if they cause other health issues.

#### What were the results?
- **With Placebo Comparison:**
  - Alirocumab and evolocumab both helped reduce heart problems and heart attacks.
  - Both medicines showed a small reduction in the risk of death.
  - They were effective in reducing the chance of having a stroke.
  
- **With Other Cholesterol Meds (Statins/Ezetimibe):**
  - The results were less clear, and the evidence was weaker.

#### How long did the study last?
Participants were followed for 6 to 36 months.

#### Were there any safety concerns?
The study didn’t find major safety problems, but it suggested being careful and considering other options before using PCSK9 inhibitors.

#### Conclusion
PCSK9 inhibitors can be helpful for people who can't take other cholesterol-lowering drugs. However, their effectiveness compared to other treatments needs more study. Safety needs to be looked at further, too."
"Background
Most cancer survivors receive follow‐up care after completion of treatment with the primary aim of detecting recurrence. Traditional follow‐up consisting of fixed visits to a cancer specialist for examinations and tests are expensive and may be burdensome for the patient. Follow‐up strategies involving non‐specialist care providers, different intensity of procedures, or addition of survivorship care packages have been developed and tested, however their effectiveness remains unclear. 
Objectives
The objective of this review is to compare the effect of different follow‐up strategies in adult cancer survivors, following completion of primary cancer treatment, on the primary outcomes of overall survival and time to detection of recurrence. Secondary outcomes are health‐related quality of life, anxiety (including fear of recurrence), depression and cost. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases and two trials registries on 11 December 2018 together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised trials comparing different follow‐up strategies for adult cancer survivors following completion of curatively‐intended primary cancer treatment, which included at least one of the outcomes listed above. We compared the effectiveness of: 1) non‐specialist‐led follow‐up (i.e. general practitioner (GP)‐led, nurse‐led, patient‐initiated or shared care) versus specialist‐led follow‐up; 2) less intensive versus more intensive follow‐up (based on clinical visits, examinations and diagnostic procedures) and 3) follow‐up integrating additional care components relevant for detection of recurrence (e.g. patient symptom education or monitoring, or survivorship care plans) versus usual care. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological guidelines by Cochrane and Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. For each comparison, we present synthesised findings for overall survival and time to detection of recurrence as hazard ratios (HR) and for health‐related quality of life, anxiety and depression as mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). When meta‐analysis was not possible, we reported the results from individual studies. For survival and recurrence, we used meta‐regression analysis where possible to investigate whether the effects varied with regards to cancer site, publication year and study quality. 
Main results
We included 53 trials involving 20,832 participants across 12 cancer sites and 15 countries, mainly in Europe, North America and Australia. All the studies were carried out in either a hospital or general practice setting. Seventeen studies compared non‐specialist‐led follow‐up with specialist‐led follow‐up, 24 studies compared intensity of follow‐up and 12 studies compared patient symptom education or monitoring, or survivorship care plans with usual care. Risk of bias was generally low or unclear in most of the studies, with a higher risk of bias in the smaller trials. 
Non‐specialist‐led follow‐up compared with specialist‐led follow‐up 
It is uncertain how this strategy affects overall survival (HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.15; 2 studies; 603 participants), time to detection of recurrence (4 studies, 1691 participants) or cost (8 studies, 1756 participants) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. 
Non‐specialist‐ versus specialist‐led follow up may make little or no difference to health‐related quality of life at 12 months (MD 1.06, 95% CI −1.83 to 3.95; 4 studies; 605 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and probably makes little or no difference to anxiety at 12 months (MD −0.03, 95% CI −0.73 to 0.67; 5 studies; 1266 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). We are more certain that it has little or no effect on depression at 12 months (MD 0.03, 95% CI −0.35 to 0.42; 5 studies; 1266 participants; high‐certainty evidence). 
Less intensive follow‐up compared with more intensive follow‐up 
Less intensive versus more intensive follow‐up may make little or no difference to overall survival (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.14; 13 studies; 10,726 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and probably increases time to detection of recurrence (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.92; 12 studies; 11,276 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Meta‐regression analysis showed little or no difference in the intervention effects by cancer site, publication year or study quality. 
It is uncertain whether this strategy has an effect on health‐related quality of life (3 studies, 2742 participants), anxiety (1 study, 180 participants) or cost (6 studies, 1412 participants) because the certainty of evidence is very low. None of the studies reported on depression. 
Follow‐up strategies integrating additional patient symptom education or monitoring, or survivorship care plans compared with usual care: 
None of the studies reported on overall survival or time to detection of recurrence.
It is uncertain whether this strategy makes a difference to health‐related quality of life (12 studies, 2846 participants), anxiety (1 study, 470 participants), depression (8 studies, 2351 participants) or cost (1 studies, 408 participants), as the certainty of evidence is very low. 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence regarding the effectiveness of the different follow‐up strategies varies substantially. Less intensive follow‐up may make little or no difference to overall survival but probably delays detection of recurrence. However, as we did not analyse the two outcomes together, we cannot make direct conclusions about the effect of interventions on survival after detection of recurrence. The effects of non‐specialist‐led follow‐up on survival and detection of recurrence, and how intensity of follow‐up affects health‐related quality of life, anxiety and depression, are uncertain. There was little evidence for the effects of follow‐up integrating additional patient symptom education/monitoring and survivorship care plans.","Follow‐up strategies after completion of primary cancer treatment
What is the aim of this review? 
In this Cochrane Review, we aimed to find out if cancer survivors who received three different types of follow‐up care, after they were treated for their cancer, have better medical and personal outcomes. We collected and assessed all relevant studies and found 53 studies. 
Key messages 
Non‐specialist‐led follow‐up, such as follow‐up provided by a general practitioner (GP) or nurse, makes little or no difference to health‐related quality of life, anxiety or depression, when compared to specialist‐led follow‐up. We cannot be sure about its effects on overall survival and detection of a cancer returning after treatment (recurrence). 
Less intensive follow‐up, such as follow‐up with fewer examinations or tests, may make little or no difference to overall survival but probably delays detection of recurrence when compared to more intensive follow‐up. However, other types of studies are needed before we can be certain about the effects of early detection of recurrence on survival. We also cannot be sure about its effect on health‐related quality of life, anxiety and depression. 
There was little evidence for the final type of follow‐up, which integrated additional components relevant for detection of recurrence, such as patient symptom education or monitoring, or survivorship care plans. 
What was studied in the review? 
After being treated for cancer, most patients receive follow‐up care to look for signs of recurrence. If the cancer returns, it is thought to be better to detect it earlier, as it allows earlier treatment, which is expected to improve survival for the patient. Traditional follow‐up involving fixed visits to a cancer specialist in a hospital setting for examinations and tests can be expensive and burdensome for the patient. Newer follow‐up strategies involving non‐specialist care providers, different intensity of examinations, or the addition of survivorship care plans have been developed and tested but their effectiveness remains unclear. 
The aim of our review was to find out if three types of aftercare increased survival, decreased the time until recurrence is detected, and improved patient outcomes such as health‐related quality of life, anxiety and depression, as well as cost. The types of aftercare were: 1) non‐specialist‐led (e.g. GP‐led, nurse‐led, patient‐initiated or shared care) versus specialist‐led follow‐up; 2) less intensive versus more intensive follow‐up (based on frequency or intensity of clinical visits, examinations or diagnostic procedures); and 3) follow‐up integrating additional care components relevant for detection of recurrence (e.g. patient symptom education or monitoring, or survivorship care plans) versus usual care. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We analysed 53 studies, involving 20,832 participants with 12 types of cancer in 15 different countries, mainly in Europe, North America and Australia. All the studies were carried out in either a hospital or general practice setting. 
When cancer survivors receive aftercare led by non‐specialists, such as GPs and nurses:  
‐ We are not sure if overall survival is affected or if cancer recurrence is detected earlier; 
‐ It probably makes little or no difference to health‐related quality of life and anxiety and it makes no difference for depression at 12 months of follow‐up; 
‐ We are not sure there is a difference in costs between these two types of follow‐up strategies. 
When cancer survivors receive less intensive aftercare, such as fewer examinations and tests:  
‐ It may make little or no difference to overall survival but it probably delays detection of recurrence; 
‐ We are not sure if makes a difference to health‐related quality of life, anxiety and costs. We did not find any studies assessing depression. 
When cancer survivors receive aftercare with additional education about their symptoms or survivorship care plans:  
‐ We are not sure about how this type of aftercare improves health‐related quality of life, anxiety or depression, or if increases the costs of care. We did not find any studies that assessed overall survival or if cancer recurrence is detected earlier. 
How up to date is this review? 
We reviewed studies that had been published up to 11 December 2018.","# Plain Language Summary: Follow-Up Care for Cancer Survivors

## What is this study about?

This review looked at different ways doctors can follow up with cancer patients after their treatment ends. The goal was to see which follow-up methods work best to catch cancer if it comes back, while also being easier and less expensive for patients.

## Why does this matter?

After cancer treatment, patients need regular check-ups to watch for the cancer returning. Right now, most patients see a cancer specialist many times for tests and exams. This can be costly and hard on patients. Researchers wanted to know if other ways of following up—like seeing a regular doctor instead, having fewer appointments, or getting special education about watching for warning signs—work just as well.

## What did researchers do?

Scientists looked at 53 different studies involving over 20,000 cancer patients from around the world. They compared three main types of follow-up care:

1. **Regular doctor visits** (like seeing your family doctor) versus **specialist visits** (seeing a cancer doctor)
2. **Fewer appointments and tests** versus **more frequent appointments and tests**
3. **Special programs** (like learning to spot warning signs or getting a survivorship care plan) versus **standard care**

## What did they find?

**Regular doctor visits vs. specialist visits:**
- We don't know for sure if it affects how long patients survive
- It probably doesn't change anxiety or depression
- It may work about the same for quality of life

**Fewer appointments vs. more appointments:**
- Fewer appointments probably don't hurt survival chances
- But fewer appointments may delay finding cancer if it comes back
- We're not sure how it affects quality of life or anxiety

**Special education programs:**
- Not enough information to say if they help with survival or catching recurrence
- We're not sure if they improve quality of life or reduce anxiety

## Bottom line

There isn't enough clear evidence yet to say which follow-up method is best. Fewer doctor visits might be okay for survival, but they could delay finding cancer returning. More research is needed.","## Study Summary: Different Follow-Up Care for Cancer Survivors

### What was the study about?

This study looked at how different ways of checking on cancer survivors after treatment affect their health. It aimed to see which follow-up methods work best for helping patients live longer and spotting cancer if it comes back.

### Who was studied?

The study involved 20,832 adult cancer survivors from 15 countries, mostly in Europe, North America, and Australia.

### What were they testing?

They tested three different approaches to follow-up care:
1. **Non-Specialist Care**: Follow-up led by general doctors or nurses instead of cancer specialists.
2. **Intensity of Check-Ups**: Fewer visits and tests compared to more frequent ones.
3. **Extra Care Plans**: Including additional education or monitoring during follow-ups.

### What outcomes did they look at?

- Main outcomes: Overall survival and time to spot cancer coming back.
- Other outcomes: Quality of life, anxiety, depression, and cost.

### What did they find?

1. **Non-Specialist Care vs. Specialist Care**: 
   - It's uncertain if his approach affects survival, time to detect cancer returning, or costs. 
   - It might not change quality of life, anxiety, or depression much.

2. **Less Intensive vs. More Intensive Care**:
   - Less intense check-ups might not change survival rates but could delay catching cancer's return.
   - There’s not enough clarity on its impact on quality of life, anxiety, or costs.

3. **Extra Care Plans vs. Usual Care**:
   - There’s not enough evidence to say if these plans affect survival, cancer detection, quality of life, anxiety, depression, or costs.

### Conclusion

The study found big differences in how effective these follow-up methods are. Less frequent check-ups might not change survival rates but could delay spotting cancer's return. However, more research is needed to understand how these approaches affect patients' well-being and emotions.

### Note

The evidence for most outcomes varied, and more high-quality studies are needed to draw stronger conclusions."
"Background
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a common cause of neurodegenerative dementia of old age. Its accurate recognition can be important in clinical management and is essential for the development of disease‐modifying treatments. The current clinical diagnostic criteria are limited particularly by relatively poor sensitivity. Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging using single‐photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is the most highly developed supplementary test for DLB, and is now incorporated as a suggestive feature in the consensus diagnostic criteria. However, there is uncertainty about its accuracy and its place in clinical practice. It is most commonly used in people who are already suspected of having DLB. 
Objectives
We had two objectives in this review: (A) to estimate the accuracy of DAT imaging for the diagnosis of DLB in people with dementia in secondary care (specialist dementia services), and (B) to estimate the accuracy of DAT imaging for the diagnosis of DLB in people with dementia in secondary care who are already suspected of having DLB on the basis of a prior clinical work‐up. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE (1946 to February 2013), Embase (1980 to February 2013), BIOSIS Previews (1926 to February 2013), PsycINFO (1806 to February 2013), CINAHL (1982 to February 2013), LILACS (February 2013) and Web of Science and Conference Proceedings (ISI Web of Science) (1945 to February 2013). Several of these sources contain conference abstracts. We also searched four specialised databases containing diagnostic reviews: Meta‐analyses van Diagnostisch Onderzoek (MEDION; February 2013), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE; February 2013), Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA; February 2013), and Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility (ARIF; February 2013). We checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews for potential additional studies. Terms for electronic database searching were devised in conjunction with the team at the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group. 
Selection criteria
Study design: We included test accuracy studies with delayed verification, diagnostic case‐control studies, and two‐gate studies with alternative diagnosis controls. Participants: (A) participants with dementia in secondary care, (B) participants in secondary care meeting consensus clinical criteria (other than the DAT imaging criterion) for possible or probable DLB, or both. Index test: SPECT or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of brain dopamine transporters. Reference standard: Neuropathological diagnosis at autopsy. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. We extracted results into a 2x2 table, showing the binary test results cross‐classified with the binary reference standard. We used this data to calculate sensitivities, specificities, and their 95% confidence intervals. We used the QUADAS‐2 tool plus some additional items to assess methodological quality. 
Main results
We included one study that was applicable to our first objective (A). It reported data on 22 participants who met consensus clinical criteria for DLB or National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS‐ADRDA) criteria for Alzheimer's disease, or both (a two‐gate design with alternative diagnosis controls). The index test was SPECT scanning using the ligand 123I‐FP‐CIT. We considered the study to be at high risk of bias in the participant selection and index test domains (QUADAS‐2). 123I‐FP‐CIT SPECT analysed semiquantitatively had a sensitivity of 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 1.00) and a specificity of 0.92 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.00) for the diagnosis of DLB (n = 22, 1 study). Analysed visually, the sensitivity was 0.86 (95% CI 0.42 to 1.00) and the specificity was 0.83 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.98) (n = 19, 1 study). 
We considered that the study also provided the best available data to address our second objective (B). At baseline, 15 participants were clinically suspected of having DLB. In this group, 123I‐FP‐CIT SPECT scanning analysed semiquantitatively had a sensitivity of 1.00 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.00) and a specificity of 1.00 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.00) for the diagnosis of DLB (n = 15, 1 study). Analysed visually, accuracy in this group was lower with a sensitivity of 0.83 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.00) and a specificity of 0.71 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.96) (n = 13, 1 study). 
Authors' conclusions
Only one study has used a neuropathological reference standard to assess the accuracy of DAT imaging for the diagnosis of DLB. The small size of the included study means that sensitivity and specificity estimates are imprecise. However, data from this study suggest that DAT imaging is more accurate than clinical diagnosis. Clinical diagnosis is therefore unsuitable to use as a reference standard for assessing the accuracy of DAT imaging. 
No studies using a neuropathological reference standard have directly addressed the common clinical scenario where the use of DAT imaging is considered as a diagnostic test in a person with possible DLB, or assessed the accuracy of DAT imaging in people with mild dementia. However, the data from the included study suggest that, where there is moderately severe dementia and a strong pre‐existing suspicion of DLB (probable DLB), then a normal (123)I‐FP‐CIT SPECT scan may be an accurate means of excluding the diagnosis. 
Semiquantitative ratings of 123I‐FP‐CIT SPECT scans appeared to be more accurate than visual ratings in all analyses.","Dopamine transporter imaging for the diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is one of the more common causes of dementia in old age. At present, it is diagnosed on the basis of the presence of characteristic symptoms, of which the most important are visual hallucinations, fluctuations in cognition, and Parkinsonism (movement symptoms like those seen in Parkinson's disease). However, many people who have DLB do not have all of these symptoms, and it can be hard to distinguish from other causes of dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is important to diagnose it accurately because people with DLB can have particularly severe side effects if given antipsychotic medication and, in the long term, so that treatments can be improved. Diagnosis of DLB using clinical symptoms alone has proven in some studies not to be very sensitive, that is cases of DLB are often missed. 
People with DLB have reduced levels of the dopamine transporter protein (DAT) in a part of the brain known as the corpus striatum. It is possible, using tracers that bind to the dopamine transporter, to identify this reduction on certain brain scans (PET or SPECT scans). This is known as DAT imaging. It has been suggested that DAT imaging may help in the accurate diagnosis of DLB. In this review, we aimed to assess how accurately DAT imaging can identify DLB among all people with dementia seen in specialist dementia services (secondary care). Because DAT scans are expensive, they are usually used in people in whom a doctor already suspects the presence of DLB, so we also aimed to see how accurately DAT imaging identified DLB among these people. We only looked for studies in which the diagnosis was confirmed by examining the person's brain after death. 
We found only one study of 22 participants to include in the review. The participants had been selected for the study because they had been diagnosed clinically with DLB or AD. This method of recruiting participants tends to exaggerate the accuracy of a test. The participants in the study had moderately severe dementia when they had the DAT imaging. Overall, the DAT imaging correctly classified 100% of the participants who had DLB and 92% of the participants who did not have DLB at postmortem. When we looked at only the 15 participants whom the doctors thought had DLB at the start of the study, then the DAT imaging correctly classified 100% of the participants who had DLB and 100% of the participants who did not have DLB at postmortem. The small size of the included study meant that we could not be very confident in these estimates of accuracy, and it is still possible that the test is considerably less accurate than this would suggest. We can conclude that DAT imaging is a promising test for diagnosing DLB, but it is important to note that we did not find any studies of participants in whom diagnosis may be more difficult, such as those with only mild dementia or those who have only one symptom to raise a suspicion of DLB.","# Plain Language Summary

## What is this study about?

This study looked at how well a special brain scan can help doctors identify a condition called dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). DLB is a type of memory loss that happens in older people. Doctors want a better way to figure out if someone has DLB because it affects how they treat the person.

## The brain scan being tested

The scan is called a dopamine transporter (DAT) scan. It takes pictures of a specific part of the brain to see if it's working the way it should. This scan might help doctors know for sure if someone has DLB.

## What the researchers did

The researchers looked through medical studies from 1945 to February 2013 to find research about how well this brain scan works. They wanted to know:
- How accurate is the DAT scan for finding DLB in people with memory problems?
- How accurate is it in people who doctors already think might have DLB?

## What they found

The researchers found only **one study** that tested this question properly. That study included 22 people.

**The results showed:**
- When doctors used a computer to analyze the scan, it correctly found DLB in all cases and correctly ruled it out in most cases
- When doctors looked at the scan by eye, it was less accurate
- The scan worked best in people who doctors already suspected had DLB

## What this means

The brain scan appears to be helpful for identifying DLB, especially in people doctors already think might have it. However, more research is needed because only one small study has been done.","### Study Summary

#### Purpose
This study wanted to see how well a special brain scan, called DAT imaging, works for finding a condition called Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). This is most useful for doctors who are trying to figure out what's causing a person's memory and thinking problems.

#### Who Was Studied?
The study looked at people in specialized dementia care who either definitely had DLB, possibly had DLB, or had Alzheimer's disease.

#### What Was Tested?
They used a brain scan called SPECT to check dopamine levels in the brain. This scan helps to see if someone might have DLB by comparing it to results found during an autopsy.

#### Key Findings
- For people who definitely might have DLB, the scan was very accurate in confirming or ruling out the condition. 
- When using numbers to look at the scans, it was more accurate than just looking at the pictures visually.
- If the scan looked normal, it was a good sign that the person probably didn’t have DLB.

#### Safety and Accuracy
The scan seemed to be safer and more accurate than just regular clinical check-ups.

#### Conclusion
The study showed that using DAT imaging could be a reliable way to tell if someone has DLB, especially if doctors already suspect it. More studies with bigger groups of people could help confirm these findings."
"Background
Long‐acting beta‐agonists are a common second line treatment in people with asthma inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids. Single device inhalers combine a long‐acting beta‐agonist with an inhaled steroid delivering both drugs as a maintenance treatment regimen. This updated review compares two fixed‐dose options, fluticasone/salmeterol FP/SALand budesonide/formoterol, since this comparison represents a common therapeutic choice. 
Objectives
To assess the relative effects of fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol in people with asthma. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group register of trials with prespecified terms. We performed additional hand searching of manufacturers' web sites and online trial registries. Search results are current to June 2011. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised studies comparing fixed dose fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol in adults or children with a diagnosis of asthma. Treatment in the studies had to last for a minimum of 12 weeks. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion in the review. We combined continuous data outcomes with a mean difference (MD), and dichotomous data outcomes with an odds ratio (OR). We assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. 
Main results
Five studies met the review entry criteria (5537 adults). Study populations entered the studies having previously been treated with inhaled steroids and had moderate or mild airway obstruction (mean FEV1 predicted between 65% and 84% at baseline). Most of the studies assessed treatment over a period of six months. The studies were at a low risk of selection and performance/detection bias, although we could not determine whether missing data had an impact on the results. Availablility of outcome data was satisfactory. 
Primary outcomes 
The odds ratio for exacerbations requiring oral steroids was lower with fluticasone/salmeterol but did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.07, four studies, N = 4949). With an assumed risk with budesonide/formoterol of 106/1000 participants requiring oral steroids, treatment with fluticasone/salmeterol would lead to between 25 fewer and seven more people per 1000 experiencing a course of oral steroids. Although the odds of hospital admission was higher with fluticasone/salmeterol, this did not reach statistical significance (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.47, four studies, 4879 participants). With an assumed risk in the budesonide/formoterol of 7/1000, between three fewer and nine more people per 1000 would be hospitalised on fluticasone/salmeterol. The odds of a serious adverse event related to asthma was higher with fluticasone/salmeterol but did not differ significantly between treatments (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.86, three studies, 4054 participants). With an assumed risk in the budesonide/formoterol of 7/1000, between two fewer and 13 more people per 1000 would experience a serious adverse event on fluticasone/salmeterol. 
Secondary outcomes 
Lung function outcomes, symptoms, rescue medication, composite of exacerbations leading to either emergency department visit or hospital admission, withdrawals and adverse events did not differ statistically between treatments. Assessment of quality of life was limited to two studies, both of which gave results that did not reach statistical significance. One study reported one death out of 1000 participants on fluticasone/salmeterol and no deaths in a similar number of participants treated with budesonide/formoterol. No deaths were reported in the other studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Statistical imprecision in the effect estimates for exacerbations and serious adverse events do not enable us to conclude that either therapy is superior. The uncertainty around the effect estimates justify further trials to provide more definitive conclusions; the overall quality of evidence based on GRADE recommendations for the three primary outcomes and withdrawals due to serious adverse events was moderate. We rated the quality of evidence for mortality to be low. Results for lung function outcomes showed that the drugs were sufficiently similar that further research is unlikely to change the effects. No trials were identified in the under‐12s and research in this population is a high priority. Evaluation of quality of life is a priority for future research.","Different combinations of inhaled steroids and long‐acting beta‐agonists for chronic asthma (fluticasone/salmeterol versus budesonide/formoterol) 
People with persistent asthma often require an additional treatment to regular inhaled steroids. Some preparations of long‐acting beta‐agonists are delivered in the same inhaler device as the inhaled corticosteroids. Inhaled steroids help to treat inflammation of the airway and long‐acting beta‐agonists help the airway to relax, improving symptoms and lung function. This systematic review examined randomised controlled trials comparing two commonly available combinations administered at a fixed dose through a single inhaler, fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol. We included five studies which recruited 5537 people. The trials were generally well designed but only recruited adults and adolescents and not children. Participants were already taking regular inhaled steroids before the studies commenced and had mild or moderate asthma based on tests of their airway. We found that the number of people who required treatment with oral steroids and admission to hospital was similar between the treatments, but due to the statistical uncertainty of this result we could not rule out important differences in favour of either drug combination. Additional trials would enable us to draw more reliable conclusions about how well these drugs work compared with each other. We also looked at serious adverse events. Again, the results did not indicate that one combination was clearly better than the other, but again these results were imprecise so we cannot be certain. However, lung function and rescue medication use were similar between the treatments. We could not assess the relative effects of these drugs on mortality because there were so few deaths which leads to statistical uncertainty; out of the five studies, one person died. Quality of life was measured in different ways in two studies and we could not determine how the treatments compared in this respect. Further studies are needed to strengthen and better explain these findings. In particular studies which assess the effects of these therapies in children and studies which measure quality of life are a priority.","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Two Asthma Inhalers

## What is this study about?
This review compared two combination inhalers used to treat asthma. Both inhalers contain two medicines that work together: a long-acting bronchodilator (a medicine that opens airways) and a steroid (a medicine that reduces inflammation). The two inhalers tested were:
- Fluticasone/salmeterol (FP/SAL)
- Budesonide/formoterol

## Who was in the study?
The review looked at 5 studies with a total of 5,537 adults. All participants had asthma that wasn't well controlled with steroid inhalers alone. They had mild to moderate airway obstruction at the start. Most studies lasted about 6 months.

## What did researchers compare?
Researchers looked at whether one inhaler was better than the other at:
- Preventing asthma flare-ups that required oral steroids (pills)
- Preventing hospital admissions
- Preventing serious asthma-related side effects
- Improving lung function and quality of life
- Reducing symptoms and need for rescue inhalers

## What were the main findings?
**The two inhalers worked similarly.** The differences between them were very small and not statistically significant, meaning the results could have happened by chance. For example:
- Both inhalers prevented flare-ups requiring oral steroids at similar rates
- Hospital admission rates were similar
- Serious side effects were rare with both
- Lung function improved similarly with both

One death was reported in the fluticasone/salmeterol group, but none in the budesonide/formoterol group.

## What do the researchers conclude?
The researchers found no clear evidence that one inhaler is better than the other. They recommend more research to provide clearer answers. They also noted that **no studies included children under 12**, so more research in this age group is needed.","### Plain Language Summary

**Purpose of the Study**

This study looks at two inhaler combinations used for asthma treatment: fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol. Both are used when asthma is not well-controlled with regular inhalers.

**Who Was Studied**

The study focused on adults with asthma who had mild or moderate breathing problems and were already using inhaled steroids. 

**What Was Done**

Researchers checked past studies comparing the two inhaler combinations. They looked for studies that lasted at least 12 weeks and involved either adults or children with asthma.

**What Was Found**

- **Main Findings**: Both inhaler combinations had similar effects on lung function and did not significantly differ in preventing severe asthma attacks needing emergency care or hospital visits.

- **Safety and Side Effects**: There was no clear difference in serious side effects between the two inhaler options. Both were considered safe, but more research is needed to be sure.

- **Other Outcomes**: Quality of life and other asthma symptoms were also looked at, with no major differences found between the two treatments.

**Conclusions**

It's still unclear if one inhaler combination is better than the other for people with asthma. More studies are needed, especially for children under 12 and to better understand quality of life impacts. Both treatments appear to work similarly for improving breathing and managing asthma symptoms."
"Background
Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is characterised by partial or complete upper airway obstruction during sleep. Approximately 1% to 4% of children are affected by OSA, with adenotonsillar hypertrophy being the most common underlying risk factor. Surgical removal of enlarged adenoids or tonsils is the currently recommended first‐line treatment for OSA due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Given the perioperative risk and an estimated recurrence rate of up to 20% following surgery, there has recently been an increased interest in less invasive alternatives to adenotonsillectomy. As the enlarged adenoids and tonsils consist of hypertrophied lymphoid tissue, anti‐inflammatory drugs have been proposed as a potential non‐surgical treatment option in children with OSA. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of anti‐inflammatory drugs for the treatment of OSA in children. 
Search methods
We identified trials from searches of the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL and MEDLINE (1950 to 2019). For identification of ongoing clinical trials, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anti‐inflammatory drugs against placebo in children between one and 16 years with objectively diagnosed OSA (apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) ≥ 1 per hour). 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently performed screening, data extraction, and quality assessment. We separately pooled results for the comparisons 'intranasal steroids' and 'montelukast' against placebo using random‐effects models. The primary outcomes for this review were AHI and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes included the respiratory disturbance index, desaturation index, respiratory arousal index, nadir arterial oxygen saturation, mean arterial oxygen saturation, avoidance of surgical treatment for OSA, clinical symptom score, tonsillar size, and adverse events. 
Main results
We included five trials with a total of 240 children aged one to 18 years with mild to moderate OSA (AHI 1 to 30 per hour). All trials were performed in specialised sleep medicine clinics at tertiary care centres. Follow‐up time ranged from six weeks to four months. 
Three RCTs (n = 137) compared intranasal steroids against placebo; two RCTs compared oral montelukast against placebo (n = 103). We excluded one trial from the meta‐analysis since the patients were not analysed as randomised. We also had concerns about selective reporting in another trial. 
We are uncertain about the difference in AHI (MD −3.18, 95% CI −8.70 to 2.35) between children receiving intranasal corticosteroids compared to placebo (2 studies, 75 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In contrast, children receiving oral montelukast had a lower AHI (MD −3.41, 95% CI −5.36 to −1.45) compared to those in the placebo group (2 studies, 103 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
We are uncertain whether the secondary outcomes are different between children receiving intranasal corticosteroids compared to placebo: desaturation index (MD −2.12, 95% CI −4.27 to 0.04; 2 studies, 75 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), respiratory arousal index (MD −0.71, 95% CI −6.25 to 4.83; 2 studies, 75 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and nadir oxygen saturation (MD 0.59%, 95% CI −1.09 to 2.27; 2 studies, 75 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Children receiving oral montelukast had a lower respiratory arousal index (MD −2.89, 95% CI −4.68 to −1.10; 2 studies, 103 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and nadir of oxygen saturation (MD 4.07, 95% CI 2.27 to 5.88; 2 studies, 103 participants; high‐certainty evidence) compared to those in the placebo group. We are uncertain, however, about the difference in desaturation index (MD −2.50, 95% CI −5.53 to 0.54; 2 studies, 103 participants; low‐certainty evidence) between the montelukast and placebo group. 
Adverse events were assessed and reported in all trials and were rare, of minor nature (e.g. nasal bleeding), and evenly distributed between study groups. 
No study examined the avoidance of surgical treatment for OSA as an outcome.
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence for the efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids for the treatment of OSA in children; they may have short‐term beneficial effects on the desaturation index and oxygen saturation in children with mild to moderate OSA but the certainty of the benefit on the primary outcome AHI, as well as the respiratory arousal index, was low due to imprecision of the estimates and heterogeneity between studies. 
Montelukast has short‐term beneficial treatment effects for OSA in otherwise healthy, non‐obese, surgically untreated children (moderate certainty for primary outcome and moderate and high certainty, respectively, for two secondary outcomes) by significantly reducing the number of apnoeas, hypopnoeas, and respiratory arousals during sleep. In addition, montelukast was well tolerated in the children studied. The clinical relevance of the observed treatment effects remains unclear, however, because minimal clinically important differences are not yet established for polysomnography‐based outcomes in children. 
Long‐term efficacy and safety data on the use of anti‐inflammatory medications for the treatment of OSA in childhood are still not available. In addition, patient‐centred outcomes like concentration ability, vigilance, or school performance have not been investigated yet. 
There are currently no RCTs on the use of other kinds of anti‐inflammatory medications for the treatment of OSA in children. 
Future RCTs should investigate sustainability of treatment effects, avoidance of surgical treatment for OSA, and long‐term safety of anti‐inflammatory medications for the treatment of OSA in children and include patient‐centred outcomes.","Anti‐inflammatory medications for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea in children
Background 
Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is the partial or complete blockage of the upper airways during sleep. It affects about 1% to 4% of children. The most common underlying reason for OSA in childhood are enlarged adenoids or tonsils. The currently recommended treatment is surgical removal of the adenoids and tonsils. Treatment with anti‐inflammatory medications is an alternative, non‐surgical treatment in milder cases of OSA. 
Review question 
The aim of this review was to evaluate the evidence on the benefits and safety of anti‐inflammatory medications for the treatment of OSA in children between one and 16 years of age. The primary outcomes of the review were the number of breathing pauses and episodes of shallow breathing per hour of sleep (apnoea/hypopnoea index, AHI) and serious unintended effects of the medication. 
Study characteristics 
We included five studies in the review. These studies each included 25 to 62 children between one and 11 years of age with mild to moderate OSA treated at specialised sleep outpatient clinics. The included studies used two different types of anti‐inflammatory medications. Seventy‐five children were randomised to receive either intranasal corticosteroid nasal spray or placebo. One hundred and three children were randomised to either montelukast tablet or placebo. 
Study funding sources 
Three studies were supported by drug manufacturers.
Key results 
We are uncertain about the difference in the number of breathing pauses, episodes of shallow breathing, episodes with a lack of blood oxygen, or sleep disruption between children receiving corticosteroid nasal spray compared to placebo (2 studies involving 75 children). 
Children receiving montelukast tablets had fewer breathing pauses, fewer episodes of shallow breathing, and less sleep disruption compared to those treated with placebo (2 studies involving 103 children). However, we are uncertain about the difference in the number of episodes with a lack of blood oxygen between the montelukast and placebo group. 
Unintended effects were assessed in all trials, but were rare and of minor nature (e.g. nosebleeds). Serious unintended effects were not reported. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence for corticosteroid nasal spray for the treatment of OSA was low for the primary outcome due to the wide range of the beneficial effect with some inconsistency of the effect between the two included studies. We excluded one study from the analysis due to serious concerns about the quality of the study results. 
The evidence for the use of montelukast tablets in the treatment of OSA was of moderate certainty for the primary outcome. There were concerns about the design and conduct of one study and some inconsistency of the effect between the two included studies. 
The evidence is current to October 2019.","# Plain Language Summary: Anti-Inflammatory Drugs for Sleep Apnea in Children

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether anti-inflammatory medicines (drugs that reduce swelling) can help treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children. OSA is a condition where a child's airway becomes blocked during sleep, making it hard to breathe.

## Why is this important?

About 1–4 out of every 100 children have OSA. Usually, doctors treat it by surgically removing enlarged adenoids or tonsils (small tissues in the throat). However, surgery has risks, and the problem comes back in about 1 out of 5 children. Researchers wanted to see if anti-inflammatory medicines could be a safer option instead of surgery.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers reviewed 5 studies that tested two types of anti-inflammatory medicines:
- **Intranasal steroids** (nasal spray steroids) — tested in 3 studies with 137 children
- **Montelukast** (a pill) — tested in 2 studies with 103 children

All children were ages 1–18 years old with mild to moderate sleep apnea. Studies lasted 6 weeks to 4 months.

## What were the main findings?

**Intranasal steroids:**
- Results were unclear. The nasal spray may have helped a little, but researchers weren't confident in the results.

**Montelukast:**
- This medicine showed better results. Children taking montelukast had fewer breathing interruptions during sleep compared to children taking a placebo (fake pill).
- Children also had fewer times their sleep was disrupted by breathing problems.
- Oxygen levels improved slightly.

**Safety:**
- Both medicines were safe. Side effects were rare and minor (like nosebleeds).

## What does this mean?

Montelukast may help some children with mild to moderate sleep apnea avoid surgery, at least in the short term. However, researchers don't yet know if the benefits last long-term or if the improvements matter in real life (like better school performance or focus).

## What's still needed?

- Long-term studies to see if these medicines keep working
- Studies to see if children can avoid surgery by taking these medicines
- Research on how these medicines affect children's daily life, school, and concentration","### Plain Language Summary

#### What is This Study About?

This study looks at whether certain medicines can help kids who have trouble breathing during sleep, a condition called obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Usually, kids with this problem have surgery to remove enlarged tonsils or adenoids. But surgery can have risks, and the problem sometimes comes back. So, doctors are looking for other options, like using anti-inflammatory drugs.

#### What Did the Researchers Want to Know?

The researchers wanted to see if anti-inflammatory medicines could safely and effectively help children with OSA.

#### Who Was in the Study?

The study included 240 children, aged 1 to 18 years, with mild to moderate OSA. These children were treated in special sleep clinics.

#### What Did the Study Test?

The study tested two types of anti-inflammatory treatments:

1. **Intranasal Steroids:** A spray used in the nose.
2. **Oral Montelukast:** A medicine taken by mouth.

Both were compared to a placebo (a fake treatment).

#### How Long Did the Study Last?

The study followed the children for 6 weeks to 4 months.

#### What Did They Find?

- **Intranasal Steroids:** It's unclear if these sprays help reduce breathing problems during sleep. There might be some short-term benefits, but the evidence isn't strong.
- **Montelukast:** This medicine helped reduce breathing interruptions in sleep and was tolerated well by the children. But more research is needed to know if these benefits are important in everyday life.

#### Were There Any Side Effects?

Side effects were rare and minor, such as nasal bleeding. They were similar between the real medicines and the placebo.

#### What’s Missing and What’s Next?

- No studies looked at whether these treatments help avoid surgery.
- Long-term effects and safety are still unknown.
- More research is needed to see if these medicines improve things like focus or school performance.

#### Conclusion

While there's some hope that montelukast can help kids with OSA, we need more information to know if these treatments are a good long-term solution. Future studies should focus on long-term effects, avoiding surgery, and improvements in daily life."
"Background
Worldwide at least 100 million people are thought to have prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD). This population has a five times greater chance of suffering a recurrent cardiovascular event than people without known CVD. Secondary CVD prevention is defined as action aimed to reduce the probability of recurrence of such events. Drug interventions have been shown to be cost‐effective in reducing this risk and are recommended in international guidelines. However, adherence to recommended treatments remains sub‐optimal. In order to influence non‐adherence, there is a need to develop scalable and cost‐effective behaviour‐change interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of mobile phone text messaging in patients with established arterial occlusive events on adherence to treatment, fatal and non‐fatal cardiovascular events, and adverse effects. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science on Web of Science on 7 November 2016, and two clinical trial registers on 12 November 2016. We contacted authors of included studies for missing information and searched reference lists of relevant papers. We applied no language or date restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised trials with at least 50% of the participants with established arterial occlusive events. We included trials investigating interventions using short message service (SMS) or multimedia messaging service (MMS) with the aim to improve adherence to medication for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Eligible comparators were no intervention or other modes of communication. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. In addition, we attempted to contact all authors on how the SMS were developed. 
Main results
We included seven trials (reported in 13 reports) with 1310 participants randomised. Follow‐up ranged from one month to 12 months. Due to heterogeneity in the methods, population and outcome measures, we were unable to conduct meta‐analysis on these studies. All seven studies reported on adherence, but using different methods and scales. Six out of seven trials showed a beneficial effect of mobile phone text messaging for medication adherence. Dale 2015a, reported significantly greater medication adherence score in the intervention group (Mean Difference (MD) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.97; 123 participants randomised) at six months. Khonsari 2015 reported less adherence in the control group (Relative Risk (RR) 4.09, 95% CI 1.82 to 9.18; 62 participants randomised) at eight weeks. Pandey 2014 (34 participants randomised) assessed medication adherence through self‐reported logs with 90% adherence in the intervention group compared to 70% in the control group at 12 months. Park 2014a (90 participants randomised) reported a greater increase of the medication adherence score in the control group, but also measured adherence with an event monitoring system for a number of medications with adherence levels ranging from 84.1% adherence to 86.2% in the intervention group and 79.7% to 85.7% in the control group at 30 days. Quilici 2013, reported reduced odds of non‐adherence in the intervention group (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.86, 521 participants randomised) at 30 days. Fang 2016, reported that participants given SMS alone had reduced odds of being non‐adherent compared to telephone reminders (OR 0.40 95% CI 0.18 to 0.63; 280 patients randomised). Kamal 2015 reported higher levels of adherence in the intervention arm (adjusted MD 0.54, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.85; 200 participants randomised). 
Khonsari 2015 was the only study to report fatal cardiovascular events and only reported two events, both in the control arm. No study reported on the other primary outcomes. No study reported repetitive thumb injury or road traffic crashes or other adverse events that were related to the intervention. 
Four authors replied to our questionnaire on SMS development. No study reported examining causes of non‐adherence or provided SMS tailored to individual patient characteristics. 
The included studies were small, heterogeneous and included participants recruited directly after acute events. All studies were assessed as having high risk of bias across at least one domain. Most of the studies came from high‐income countries, with two studies conducted in an upper middle‐income country (China, Malaysia), and one study from a lower middle‐income country (Pakistan). The quality of the evidence was found to be very low. There was no obvious conflicts of interest from authors, although only two declared their funding. 
Authors' conclusions
While the results of this systematic review are promising, there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of text message‐based interventions for adherence to medications for secondary prevention of CVD. Sufficiently powered, high‐quality randomised trials are needed, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries.","Text messaging to help people suffering from heart disease adhere to medications
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of text messaging on medication adherence in people with heart disease. We found seven studies including 1310 participants. 
Background 
Worldwide, at least 100 million people suffer from heart disease. While there are numerous cost‐effective treatments, the majority of these individuals are not taking the medications that they need to keep themselves from suffering more heart problems. One possible method of helping people with heart disease to take their medications is through the use of text message‐based reminders. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to November 2016. We found seven studies that compared using text messages to not using text messages, with follow‐up ranging from one month to 12 months. 
Key results 
While the results of these studies appear promising that text messages can help people take their medicines, the studies were small and utilised very different methods and definitions. For that reason, we were not able to compile the findings of the studies. Most of the studies came from high‐income countries, and were primarily conducted on men. No studies reported any bad side effects from using text messages. There was no obvious conflicts of interest from authors, although only two declared their funding. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence from these studies was very low. Additional high‐quality studies on the use of text messages for encouraging people suffering from heart disease to take their medication regularly are needed, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries.","# Plain Language Summary: Text Messages to Help Heart Patients Take Their Medicines

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether text messages on cell phones can help people with heart disease take their medicines regularly. Taking medicines as prescribed is important for people who have already had a heart attack or stroke to prevent it from happening again.

## Why is this important?

Over 100 million people worldwide have heart disease. People with heart disease are five times more likely to have another heart attack or stroke than people without it. Medicines can help prevent these events, but many people don't take them as prescribed. Researchers wanted to see if text messages could remind people to take their medicines and help them stick with their treatment.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at seven studies involving 1,310 people with heart disease. These studies tested whether sending text messages to patients' phones helped them take their heart medicines. The studies lasted between one month and one year. Most studies compared people who got text messages to people who didn't get them.

## What did they find?

**Medication adherence (taking medicines as prescribed):**
Six out of seven studies showed that text messages helped people take their medicines more regularly. For example:
- One study found 90% of people taking messages took their medicine correctly, compared to 70% without messages
- Another study showed text messages worked better than phone call reminders

**Heart events and safety:**
Only one study reported on heart attacks or strokes, and it found very few events. No studies reported any harmful effects from receiving text messages.

## What are the limitations?

- The studies were small and used different methods to measure results
- All studies had some quality problems
- Most studies were done in wealthy countries
- The overall quality of evidence was very low
- More research is needed to be sure text messages actually work

## Bottom line

Text messages show promise for helping heart patients take their medicines, but there isn't enough strong evidence yet to say for certain that they work. Better quality studies are needed, especially in lower-income countries.","**Plain Language Summary:**

**Background**
Heart disease affects over 100 million people worldwide. People with heart problems are more likely to have another heart problem. Taking medicine as prescribed can help, but many people don’t follow their treatment plan. Using text messages might help people take their medicine regularly.

**Objective**
This study looked at whether sending text messages to people with heart problems helps them take their medicine and reduce further heart issues. It also checked if there were any side effects from the texts.

**Methods**
Researchers searched databases and talked to study authors to find the right studies. They looked at studies where at least half the people had heart problems and were sent text messages to help them take their medicine. They compared these groups to those who did not get text messages or used different communication methods.

**Results**
Seven studies were included, involving 1310 participants, lasting from one to 12 months. Six out of seven studies showed that text messages helped people take their medicine better. Only one study reported two serious heart events, both in the group that did not get text messages. No other major side effects were reported.

**Conclusions**
The studies show that receiving text messages might help people with heart problems take their medicine regularly. However, the evidence isn't strong enough yet, and more research is needed, especially in countries with less wealth."
"Background
Miscarriage occurs in 10% to 15% of pregnancies. The traditional treatment, after miscarriage, has been to perform surgery to remove any remaining placental tissues in the uterus ('evacuation of uterus'). However, medical treatments, or expectant care (no treatment), may also be effective, safe, and acceptable. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness, safety, and acceptability of any medical treatment for incomplete miscarriage (before 24 weeks). 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (13 May 2016) and reference lists of retrieved papers. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials comparing medical treatment with expectant care or surgery, or alternative methods of medical treatment. We excluded quasi‐randomised trials. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and carried out data extraction. Data entry was checked. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 24 studies (5577 women). There were no trials specifically of miscarriage treatment after 13 weeks' gestation. 
Three trials involving 335 women compared misoprostol treatment (all vaginally administered) with expectant care. There was no difference in complete miscarriage (average risk ratio (RR) 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 2.10; 2 studies, 150 women, random‐effects; very low‐quality evidence), or in the need for surgical evacuation (average RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.26; 2 studies, 308 women, random‐effects; low‐quality evidence). There were few data on 'deaths or serious complications'. For unplanned surgical intervention, we did not identify any difference between misoprostol and expectant care (average RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.26; 2 studies, 308 women, random‐effects; low‐quality evidence). 
Sixteen trials involving 4044 women addressed the comparison of misoprostol (7 studies used oral administration, 6 studies used vaginal, 2 studies sublingual, 1 study combined vaginal + oral) with surgical evacuation. There was a slightly lower incidence of complete miscarriage with misoprostol (average RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94 to 0.98; 15 studies, 3862 women, random‐effects; very low‐quality evidence) but with success rate high for both methods. Overall, there were fewer surgical evacuations with misoprostol (average RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.11; 13 studies, 3070 women, random‐effects; very low‐quality evidence) but more unplanned procedures (average RR 5.03, 95% CI 2.71 to 9.35; 11 studies, 2690 women, random‐effects; low‐quality evidence). There were few data on 'deaths or serious complications'. Nausea was more common with misoprostol (average RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.53 to 4.09; 11 studies, 3015 women, random‐effects; low‐quality evidence). We did not identify any difference in women's satisfaction between misoprostol and surgery (average RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.00; 9 studies, 3349 women, random‐effects; moderate‐quality evidence). More women had vomiting and diarrhoea with misoprostol compared with surgery (vomiting: average RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.36 to 2.85; 10 studies, 2977 women, random‐effects; moderate‐quality evidence; diarrhoea: average RR 4.82, 95% CI 1.09 to 21.32; 4 studies, 757 women, random‐effects; moderate‐quality evidence). 
Five trials compared different routes of administration, or doses, or both, of misoprostol. There was no clear evidence of one regimen being superior to another.  
Limited evidence suggests that women generally seem satisfied with their care. Long‐term follow‐up from one included study identified no difference in subsequent fertility between the three approaches. 
Authors' conclusions
The available evidence suggests that medical treatment, with misoprostol, and expectant care are both acceptable alternatives to routine surgical evacuation given the availability of health service resources to support all three approaches. Further studies, including long‐term follow‐up, are clearly needed to confirm these findings. There is an urgent need for studies on women who miscarry at more than 13 weeks' gestation.","Medical treatments for incomplete miscarriage
What is the issue? 
Miscarriage is when a pregnant woman loses her baby before the baby would be considered able to survive outside the womb, i.e. before 24 weeks' gestation. Miscarriage occurs in about 10% to 15% of pregnancies and the signs are bleeding, usually with some abdominal pain and cramping. The traditional management of miscarriage was surgery but this Cochrane Review asks if medical treatments can be another management option for the woman. 
Why is this important?  
The cause of miscarriage is often unknown, but most are likely to be due to abnormalities in the baby’s chromosomes. Women experiencing miscarriage may be quite distressed, and there can be feelings of emptiness, guilt, and failure. Fathers can also be affected emotionally. Traditionally, surgery (curettage or vacuum aspiration) has been the treatment used to remove any retained tissue and it is quick to perform. It has now been suggested that medical treatments (usually misoprostol) may be as effective and may carry less risk of infection. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence on 13 May 2016 and identified 24 studies involving 5577 women, and all these studies were of women at less than 13 weeks' gestation. There were a number of different ways of giving the drugs and so there are limited data for each comparison.  
Overall, the review found no real difference in the success between misoprostol and waiting for spontaneous miscarriage (expectant care), nor between misoprostol and surgery. The overall success rate of treatment (misoprostol and surgery) was over 80% and sometimes as high as 99%, and one study identified no difference in subsequent fertility between methods of medication, surgery or expectant management. Vaginal misoprostol was compared with oral misoprostol in one study which found no difference in success, but there was an increase in the incidence of diarrhoea with oral misoprostol.  However, women on the whole seemed happy with their care, whichever treatment they were given. 
What does this mean? 
The review suggests that misoprostol or waiting for spontaneous expulsion of fragments are important alternatives to surgery, but women should be offered an informed choice. Further studies are clearly needed to confirm these findings and should include long‐term follow‐up. There is an urgent need for studies on women who miscarry at more than 13 weeks' gestation.","# Plain Language Summary: Treatment Options for Incomplete Miscarriage

## What is this study about?

This review looked at different ways to treat incomplete miscarriage (when some tissue remains in the uterus after a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy). Researchers compared three main approaches: surgery, medication, and watchful waiting (doing nothing and letting the body heal on its own).

## Why does this matter?

About 1 in 10 pregnancies end in miscarriage. Doctors have traditionally used surgery to clean out the uterus. However, other options might work just as well and be safer or easier for patients.

## What did researchers do?

Scientists reviewed 24 studies involving 5,577 women to compare these three treatment methods.

## Main findings

**Medication vs. Watchful Waiting:**
- A medication called misoprostol (taken vaginally) worked about as well as waiting to see if the body heals on its own
- Both methods had similar rates of needing surgery later

**Medication vs. Surgery:**
- Both methods worked well at completing the miscarriage
- Surgery was more successful overall, but only slightly
- Women taking medication needed fewer planned surgeries but more unplanned procedures
- Medication caused more nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
- Women were equally satisfied with both approaches

**Different medication methods:**
- No clear winner among different doses or ways of taking the medication

## Bottom line

All three treatment options are reasonable choices. The best option depends on what resources your healthcare provider has available and what you prefer.","### Plain Language Summary

**Why This Study Was Done:**
When a pregnancy ends in a miscarriage, doctors often perform surgery to remove leftover tissue from the uterus. But other ways, like taking medicine or waiting to see if the body clears it naturally, might also work well and be safe.

**Objective of the Study:**  
The goal was to see how effective, safe, and acceptable it is to use medicine for treating incomplete miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy.

**How the Study Was Done:**  
Researchers looked at different clinical trials comparing medicine treatment, waiting, and surgery. They reviewed 24 studies involving 5,577 women.

**What They Found:**

1. **Misoprostol vs. Waiting:**
   - In 3 studies with 335 women, they found no big difference in success between taking medicine or waiting.
   - The chance of needing surgery was similar for both groups.
   - There weren't many serious problems reported.

2. **Misoprostol vs. Surgery:**
   - In 16 studies with 4,044 women, both methods were successful, but surgery was a bit more likely to completely clear tissue.
   - Misoprostol led to fewer surgeries but more unplanned procedures.
   - Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were more common with misoprostol.

3. **Different Ways to Take Misoprostol:**
   - No single method of taking the medicine proved better than others.

**Other Findings:**  
Women seemed generally satisfied with the care they received, and their future fertility was similar across different treatments.

**Conclusions:**  
Taking medicine or waiting can be good alternatives to surgery for miscarriage treatment, depending on available healthcare resources. More studies are needed, especially for miscarriages happening after 13 weeks.

This study helps understand different options and supports further research to ensure safe and effective care for women experiencing miscarriage."
"Background
The use of technology in healthcare settings is on the increase and may represent a cost‐effective means of delivering rehabilitation. Reductions in treatment time, and delivery in the home, are also thought to be benefits of this approach. Children and adolescents with brain injury often experience deficits in memory and executive functioning that can negatively affect their school work, social lives, and future occupations. Effective interventions that can be delivered at home, without the need for high‐cost clinical involvement, could provide a means to address a current lack of provision. 
We have systematically reviewed studies examining the effects of technology‐based interventions for the rehabilitation of deficits in memory and executive functioning in children and adolescents with acquired brain injury. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of technology‐based interventions compared to placebo intervention, no treatment, or other types of intervention, on the executive functioning and memory of children and adolescents with acquired brain injury. 
Search methods
We ran the search on the 30 September 2015. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), EMBASE Classic + EMBASE (OvidSP), ISI Web of Science (SCI‐EXPANDED, SSCI, CPCI‐S, and CPSI‐SSH), CINAHL Plus (EBSCO), two other databases, and clinical trials registers. We also searched the internet, screened reference lists, and contacted authors of included studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing the use of a technological aid for the rehabilitation of children and adolescents with memory or executive‐functioning deficits with placebo, no treatment, or another intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts identified by the search strategy. Following retrieval of full‐text manuscripts, two review authors independently performed data extraction and assessed the risk of bias. 
Main results
Four studies (involving 206 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this review.
Three studies, involving 194 participants, assessed the effects of online interventions to target executive functioning (that is monitoring and changing behaviour, problem solving, planning, etc.). These studies, which were all conducted by the same research team, compared online interventions against a 'placebo' (participants were given internet resources on brain injury). The interventions were delivered in the family home with additional support or training, or both, from a psychologist or doctoral student. The fourth study investigated the use of a computer program to target memory in addition to components of executive functioning (that is attention, organisation, and problem solving). No information on the study setting was provided, however a speech‐language pathologist, teacher, or occupational therapist accompanied participants. 
Two studies assessed adolescents and young adults with mild to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), while the remaining two studies assessed children and adolescents with moderate to severe TBI. 
Risk of bias 
We assessed the risk of selection bias as low for three studies and unclear for one study. Allocation bias was high in two studies, unclear in one study, and low in one study. Only one study (n = 120) was able to conceal allocation from participants, therefore overall selection bias was assessed as high. 
One study took steps to conceal assessors from allocation (low risk of detection bias), while the other three did not do so (high risk of detection bias). 
Primary outcome 1: Executive functioning: Technology‐based intervention versus placebo 
Results from meta‐analysis of three studies (n = 194) comparing online interventions with a placebo for children and adolescents with TBI, favoured the intervention immediately post‐treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.66 to ‐0.09; P = 0.62; I2 = 0%). (As there is no 'gold standard' measure in the field, we have not translated the SMD back to any particular scale.) This result is thought to represent only a small to medium effect size (using Cohen’s rule of thumb, where 0.2 is a small effect, 0.5 a medium one, and 0.8 or above is a large effect); this is unlikely to have a clinically important effect on the participant. 
The fourth study (n = 12) reported differences between the intervention and control groups on problem solving (an important component of executive functioning). No means or standard deviations were presented for this outcome, therefore an effect size could not be calculated. 
The quality of evidence for this outcome according to GRADE was very low. This means future research is highly likely to change the estimate of effect. 
Primary outcome 2: Memory 
One small study (n = 12) reported a statistically significant difference in improvement in sentence recall between the intervention and control group following an eight‐week remediation programme. No means or standard deviations were presented for this outcome, therefore an effect size could not be calculated. 
Secondary outcomes 
Two studies (n = 158) reported on anxiety/depression as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and were included in a meta‐analysis. We found no evidence of an effect with the intervention (mean difference ‐5.59, 95% CI ‐11.46 to 0.28; I2 = 53%). The GRADE quality of evidence for this outcome was very low, meaning future research is likely to change the estimate of effect. 
A single study sought to record adverse events and reported none. Two studies reported on use of the intervention (range 0 to 13 and 1 to 24 sessions). One study reported on social functioning/social competence and found no effect. The included studies reported no data for other secondary outcomes (that is quality of life and academic achievement). 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides low‐quality evidence for the use of technology‐based interventions in the rehabilitation of executive functions and memory for children and adolescents with TBI. As all of the included studies contained relatively small numbers of participants (12 to 120), our findings should be interpreted with caution. The involvement of a clinician or therapist, rather than use of the technology, may have led to the success of these interventions. Future research should seek to replicate these findings with larger samples, in other regions, using ecologically valid outcome measures, and reduced clinician involvement.","Using technology to rehabilitate children and adolescents with acquired brain injury
Review question 
We aimed to assess the effects of technology‐based interventions in rehabilitating children and adolescents with acquired brain injury. 
Background 
Acquired brain injury is defined as any injury to the brain that occurs following birth and is the result of illness, medical conditions, or trauma. After acquired brain injury a person can experience difficulties with executive functions and memory. Executive functions are brain processes that involve planning and emotional control, which govern the ability to start and stop our actions. Memory processes allow us to store and recall information about our world. Executive functions also include an aspect of memory called working memory. Technology is increasingly being used to help children and adolescents recover from acquired brain injury. Technological aids used to rehabilitate memory and executive functions include pagers, smartphones, internet‐based interventions, and voice recorders. 
Search date 
We performed the searches in September 2015.
Study characteristics 
We identified four studies (including 206 participants) that investigated the effectiveness of technology‐based interventions to rehabilitate children and adolescents with traumatic brain injury. All four studies were conducted in North America, with three originating from the same research team. 
One study with 120 participants used an online Counselor‐Assisted Problem Solving (CAPS) intervention to rehabilitate executive functioning in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. 
One study with 35 participants used a Teen Online Problem‐Solving intervention to target the executive functioning of adolescents aged 11 to 18 years. 
One study with 40 participants used an online Family Problem Solving intervention to target outcomes such as behaviour and aspects of executive functioning in children aged 5 to 16 years. 
One study with 12 participants used a computer program to target cognitive‐communication skills including memory and aspects of executive functions in adolescents and young adults aged 12 to 21 years. 
Study funding sources 
All funding sources were in the USA or Canada. One study was funded by the Colorado Department of Human Services and two National Institutes of Health (NIH) awards. A second study was also funded by a NIH grant. One study was funded by a hospital charity in addition to the Easter Seal Research Institute and Apple Canada. The final study was supported by the Ohio Department of Safety. 
Key results 
This review found evidence that interventions employing technological aids did improve executive functions in adolescents with traumatic brain injury (i.e. a brain injury resulting from a road traffic accident, fall, or blow to the head). However, this result was relatively modest and is unlikely to have a clinically important effect on the child. One study employed technology to improve memory in adolescents with TBI and showed an improvement for the intervention group. It was not possible to determine how effective this approach was as the study failed to include adequate statistical information. Two studies examined the secondary outcomes of anxiety and depression but did not show any effect between the intervention and control groups at 6 months follow‐up. Only one study recorded adverse events, and reported that none occurred. Two studies reported on the amount of use the intervention received. One study reported improvements in social functioning/social competence for the intervention group. No data were reported which related to the review's other secondary outcomes. 
Quality of the evidence 
We found the quality of evidence for all outcomes to be low, which means future research is likely to change the estimate of effect. All four studies were small, and it was not always possible to conceal group allocation to participants. Three studies failed to conceal group allocation to those who measured the outcomes.","# Plain Language Summary: Technology-Based Brain Injury Rehabilitation for Kids and Teens

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether computer programs and online tools can help children and teenagers who have had a brain injury improve their memory and thinking skills (like planning and problem-solving). These tools are meant to be used at home, which could save money and time compared to going to a clinic.

## Who was studied?

The review included 4 studies with a total of 206 children and teenagers who had experienced a brain injury. Most had traumatic brain injuries (from accidents or impacts). The kids ranged from having mild to severe injuries.

## What did the studies test?

**Three studies** tested online programs that helped kids practice thinking skills like planning, problem-solving, and paying attention. Kids used these programs at home with help from a psychologist or therapist.

**One study** tested a computer program that focused on memory and thinking skills.

## What were the results?

- **Thinking skills**: The online programs showed a small improvement compared to a control group right after treatment ended. However, this improvement was so small it probably wouldn't make a real difference in a child's daily life.

- **Memory**: One small study found improvement in memory, but the results weren't clear enough to be sure.

- **Mood and anxiety**: The studies found no change in anxiety or depression.

- **Safety**: One study reported no harmful side effects.

## Important limitations

- The studies were small (only 12 to 120 kids each).
- The quality of evidence was very low, meaning future research may change these findings.
- It's unclear whether the computer programs or the therapist's help made the difference.

## What's next?

Researchers need to do larger, better-designed studies to understand if these technology tools really work.","**Plain Language Summary**

**Purpose of the Study:**
This study looks at using technology to help kids and teens with brain injuries improve their memory and thinking skills. It aims to see if using technology at home, without expensive doctor visits, can be helpful.

**Who Was Involved:**
The study focused on children and teens with brain injuries. It compared those using technology to help their memory and thinking skills with those who didn’t use technology or used different methods.

**What Was Done:**
Researchers reviewed studies where technology-based programs were used to help with memory and thinking skills. Four studies with 206 participants were included. These programs could be used at home with some help from professionals like psychologists or therapists.

**Key Findings:**
- Some improvement was noted in thinking skills right after using the online programs, but the change wasn’t very big.
- In one study, there was a small improvement in memory for those using a computer program.
- The overall evidence was considered low quality, meaning more research is needed to make sure these findings are accurate.

**Safety and Other Results:**
- No harmful effects were reported from using the technology programs.
- There was no clear improvement in anxiety or depression.
- The studies didn’t provide data on other aspects like quality of life or school performance.

**Conclusion:**
While technology-based programs might help a little with thinking skills and memory for kids and teens with brain injuries, the evidence isn’t strong. Future research should involve more participants and reduce the involvement of professionals to see how well these programs really work."
"Background
Patellar tendinopathy is an overuse condition that commonly affects athletes. Surgery is usually offered if medical and physical therapies fail to treat it effectively. There is variation in the type of surgery performed for the condition. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of surgery for patellar tendinopathy in adults.
Search methods
We searched the following databases, to 17 July 2018: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Library, OVID MEDLINE, OVID Embase, clinical trial registries (www.ClinicalTrials.gov) and the WHO trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/). 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared surgical techniques (open or arthroscopic) with non‐operative treatment (including placebo surgery, exercise or other non‐surgical modalities) in adults with patellar tendinopathy. 
Major outcomes assessed were knee pain, function, quality of life, participant global assessment of success, withdrawal rate, proportion with adverse events and proportion with tendon rupture. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors selected studies for inclusion, extracted trial characteristics and outcome data, assessed the risk of bias and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
Two trials (92 participants) met our inclusion criteria. Participants in both trials were followed for 12 months. Neither trial compared surgery to placebo surgery. One trial (40 randomised participants) compared open surgical excision with eccentric exercises, and the other compared arthroscopic surgery with sclerosing injections (52 randomised participants). Due to the nature of the interventions, neither the participants or the investigators were blinded to the group allocation, resulting in the potential for performance and detection bias. Some outcomes were selectively not recorded, leading to reporting bias. Overall, the certainty of the evidence from these studies was low for all outcomes due to the potential for bias, and imprecision due to small sample sizes. 
Compared with eccentric exercises, low‐certainty evidence indicates that open surgical excision provides no clinically important benefits with respect to knee pain, function or global assessment of success. At 12 months, mean knee pain — measured by pain with standing jump on a 10‐point scale (lower scores indicating less pain) — was 1.7 points (standard deviation (SD) 1.6) in the eccentric training group and 1.3 (SD 0.8) in the surgical group (one trial, 40 participants). This equates to an absolute pain reduction of 4% (ranging from 4% worse to 12% better, the minimal clinically important difference being 15%) and a relative reduction in pain of 10% better (ranging from 30% better to 10% worse) in the treatment group. At 12 months, function on the zero‐ to 100‐point Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment (VISA) scale was 65.7 (SD 23.8) in the eccentric training group and 72.9 (SD 11.7) in the surgical group (one trial, 40 participants). This equates to an absolute change of 7% better function (ranging from 4% worse to 19% better) and relative change of 25% better (ranging from 15% worse to 65% better, the minimal clinically important difference being 13%). Participant global assessment of success was measured by the number of people with no pain at 12 months: 7/20 participants in the eccentric training group reported no pain, compared with 5/20 in the open surgical group (risk ratio (RR) 0.71 (95% CI 0.27 to 1.88); one trial, 40 participants). There were no withdrawals, but five out of 20 people from the eccentric exercise group crossed over to open surgical excision. Quality of life, adverse events and tendon ruptures were not measured. 
Compared with sclerosing injection, low‐certainty evidence indicates that arthroscopic surgery may provide a reduction in pain and improvement in participant global assessment of success, however further studies are likely to change these results. At 12 months, mean pain with activities, measured on a 100‐point scale (lower scores indicating less pain), was 41.1 (SD 28.5) in the sclerosing injection group and 12.8 (SD 19.3) in the arthroscopic surgery group (one trial, 52 participants). This equates to an absolute pain reduction of 28% better (ranging from 15% to 42% better, the minimal clinically important difference being 15%), and a relative change of 41% better (ranging from 21% to 61% better). At 12 months, the mean participant global assessment of success, measured by satisfaction on a 100‐point scale (scale zero to 100, higher scores indicating greater satisfaction), was 52.9 (SD 32.6) in the sclerosing injection group and 86.8 (SD 20.8) in the arthroscopic surgery group (one trial, 52 participants). This equates to an absolute improvement of 34% (ranging from 19% to 49%). In both groups, one participant (4%) withdrew from the study. Functional outcome scores, including the VISA score, were not reported. Quality‐of‐life assessment, adverse events, and specifically the proportion with a tendon rupture, were not reported. 
We did not perform subgroup analysis to assess differences in outcome between arthroscopic or open surgical excision, as we did not identify more than one study with a common comparator. 
Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain if surgery is beneficial over other therapeutic interventions, namely eccentric exercises or injectables. Low‐certainty evidence shows that surgery for patellar tendinopathy may not provide clinically important benefits over eccentric exercise in terms of pain, function or participant‐reported treatment success, but may provide clinically meaningful pain reduction and treatment success when compared with sclerosing injections. However, further research is likely to change these results. The evidence was downgraded two levels due to the small sample sizes and susceptibility to bias. We are uncertain if there are additional risks associated with surgery as study authors failed to report adverse events. Surgery seems to be embedded in clinical practice for late‐stage patella tendinopathy, due to exhaustion of other therapeutic methods rather than evidence of benefit.","Surgery for patella tendinopathy (jumper's knee)
Background 
Patella tendinopathy is a painful condition that commonly affects jumping athletes who train a lot, for example those who play volleyball and basketball. Many people with the condition are unable to continue their chosen sport at the same level of competition or intensity of training. There are many treatments for the condition, the most common of which is a particular type of exercise called eccentric exercise (where the tendon is under tension while the muscle lengthens). 
Other treatments for patella tendinopathy include oral and topical analgesia (pain‐relief medication taken orally or applied to the skin), various injectables (e.g. corticosteroids) and surgery. Surgery is used if other treatments fail, and is the treatment assessed in this review. 
Study characteristics 
This Cochrane Review is current to July 2018. We searched online databases for all studies (specifically randomised controlled trials) that compared surgical treatment with non‐operative treatment in adults with patellar tendinopathy. We found two studies; they compared open surgical removal to eccentric exercises (one study involving 40 people) and arthroscopic surgery to sclerosing injections (these scar and block the blood vessels supplying nerve fibres to the diseased tendon) (one study involving 56 people). The studies were performed in an outpatient setting in two countries (Norway and Sweden). The majority of people in the studies were male, with a mean age ranging from 27 to 31 years, and mean symptom duration of 24 to 33 months. Trials were conducted without funding (financial support) from industry (medical or device companies), but some authors from the one study received funding from pharmaceutical companies in addition to research funding from non‐industry sources. 
Key results 
Compared with eccentric exercises, open surgery offered little benefit at 12 months (results for individual outcomes as follows). 
Pain (lower scores mean less pain) 
Improved by 4% (ranging from 4% worse to 12% better) or by 0.4 points on a scale of zero to 10 points. 
People who had surgery rated their pain as 1.3 points.
People who had eccentric exercises rated their pain as 1.7 points.
Global assessment of success (those who reported no pain at 12 months) 
10% fewer people had no pain (ranging from 38% less to 18% more), or 10 fewer people out of 100. 
Twenty‐five out of 100 people had no pain with surgery.
Thirty‐five out of 100 people had no pain with eccentric exercises.
Withdrawals 
No participants in either group withdrew from the study.
The study did not report on quality‐of‐life improvements or adverse events (including tendon ruptures). 
Compared with sclerosing injections, arthroscopic (keyhole) surgery offered some reduction in pain and improvement in participant global assessment of success at 12 months (results for individual outcomes as follows; further studies are likely to change these results). 
Pain (lower scores mean less pain) 
Improved by 28% (ranging from 15% to 42% better) or by 28 points on a scale of zero to 100 points. 
People who had surgery rated their pain as 12.8 points.
People who had sclerosing injection rated their pain as 41.1 points.
Global assessment of success (participant‐reported success, higher score is better) 
Improved by 34% (ranging from 19% to 49% better) or by 33.9 points on a scale of zero to 100 points. 
People who had surgery rated their pain as 86.8 points.
People who had sclerosing injection rated their pain as 52.9 points.
Withdrawals 
One person from each group (4%) withdrew from the study for reasons unrelated to the treatment. 
The study did not report on quality‐of‐life improvements, functional score improvements or adverse events (including tendon ruptures). 
Quality of the evidence 
We decided the evidence was low‐certainty due to flaws in the design of the studies that may over‐estimate benefits of treatment. For example, people involved in the study were aware of which treatment they were receiving, the studies selectively reported some results but not others, and there was imprecision in the results due to the small number of participants and trials. Therefore, we are uncertain if surgery has any benefits over eccentric exercises or sclerosing injections for treating patellar tendinopathy in adults. Further studies are likely to change the results.","# Plain Language Summary: Surgery for Patellar Tendinopathy

## What is this study about?

This study looked at whether surgery helps adults with patellar tendinopathy (a knee injury common in athletes caused by overuse). Doctors usually suggest surgery only after other treatments like physical therapy don't work. The researchers wanted to find out if surgery actually works better than other treatments.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for studies that compared surgery to non-surgical treatments (like exercise or injections) for this knee problem. They found 2 studies with a total of 92 people. Both studies followed people for 12 months.

## What were the main findings?

**Surgery vs. Exercise:**
One study compared surgery to eccentric exercises (special stretching exercises). After 12 months, surgery did not work much better than exercise for pain relief or knee function. About 7 out of 20 people in the exercise group had no pain, compared to 5 out of 20 in the surgery group.

**Surgery vs. Injections:**
The other study compared arthroscopic surgery (a less invasive type) to sclerosing injections (a type of shot). Surgery seemed to reduce pain more and made people more satisfied with results compared to injections.

## Important limitations

- Only 2 small studies were found
- The studies didn't compare surgery to fake surgery (placebo)
- Researchers couldn't hide which treatment people received, which may have affected results
- The studies didn't report information about side effects or complications

## Bottom line

We don't have strong evidence that surgery is better than other treatments like exercise or injections for this knee problem. More research is needed.","### Summary of the Study on Surgery for Patellar Tendinopathy

**Background:**
Patellar tendinopathy is a condition often seen in athletes due to overuse. If other treatments like medicine and physical therapy don't work, surgery might be an option. There are different types of surgeries for this condition.

**Purpose of the Study:**
The study aimed to understand how helpful and safe surgery is for adults with patellar tendinopathy.

**Methods:**
Researchers looked at various studies up until July 2018. They focused on studies that compared different surgeries with non-surgical treatments in adults.

**Study Selection:**
The study included two main trials with a total of 92 participants. These studies compared:
1. Open surgical excision versus exercises.
2. Arthroscopic surgery versus sclerosing injections.

**Key Findings:**
- **Open Surgical Excision vs. Exercises:** The study showed that surgery did not provide significant benefits over exercises in terms of reducing knee pain or improving function. After 12 months, both groups had similar pain levels and success rates.

- **Arthroscopic Surgery vs. Sclerosing Injections:** This surgery showed a greater reduction in pain and increased satisfaction compared to injections. However, these results might change with future studies.

**Limitations:**
- Small number of participants.
- Some outcomes were not measured or reported.
- Risk of bias was present because participants knew which group they were in.

**Conclusion:**
It's unclear if surgery is better than other treatments like exercises or injections. Surgery did not show major benefits over exercises but showed more improvement compared to injections. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and understand any additional risks related to surgery."
"Background
There is accumulating evidence that steroid sex hormones have a beneficial effect on a number of risk factors for peripheral arterial disease. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to determine whether exogenous steroid sex hormones are an effective treatment for patients with lower limb atherosclerosis. 
Search methods
For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co‐ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched August 2012) and CENTRAL 2012, Issue 7. There were no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of steroid sex hormones in patients with lower limb atherosclerosis. 
Data collection and analysis
Both authors extracted data and assessed trial quality independently. Whenever possible investigators were contacted to obtain information needed for the review that could not be found in published reports. 
Main results
Four trials appeared to meet the inclusion criteria, but one was excluded because of poor methodology. The three remaining trials compared testosterone treatment with placebo in a total of 109 subjects with intermittent claudication or critical leg ischaemia. The most recent trial to meet the inclusion criteria dated from 1971. No trials were available which investigated the potentially beneficial effects of oestrogenic hormones in women with lower limb atherosclerosis. 
Testosterone therapy produced no significant improvement in tests of walking distance or in a variety of other objective tests for peripheral arterial disease, including venous filling time, muscle blood flow and plethysmography. The relative risk for subjective improvement in symptoms using the combined trial results was also non‐significant (relative risk (RR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.48). 
Authors' conclusions
There is no evidence to date that short‐term testosterone treatment is beneficial in subjects with lower limb atherosclerosis. However, this might reflect limited data rather than the lack of a real effect.","Testosterone and oestrogen steroid sex hormones for lower limb atherosclerosis
Atherosclerosis of the arteries of the legs can become symptomatic as people age. People affected may experience discomfort and cramping pain in the legs that is triggered by exercise and relieved with rest, termed intermittent claudication. Some people with claudication go on to require reconstructive surgery and even amputation of a leg. Risk factors for peripheral arterial disease include cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and blood flow problems. The steroid sex hormones oestrogens and testosterone affect a number of these risk factors, particularly cholesterol and blood clotting, and may be helpful in peripheral vascular disease. 
Although four randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, one was excluded because of poor methodology. The three remaining trials compared testosterone treatment with placebo in a total of 109 middle‐aged to elderly people, predominantly men. The participants had symptoms of lower limb atherosclerosis, predominantly intermittent claudication. The trials were published from 1967 to 1971 and all took place in Denmark. Testosterone did not provide any clear improvement in the symptoms reported by the participants, walking distance or other objective tests for peripheral arterial disease including leg muscle blood flow. The dose of testosterone in the trials varied between 300 mg taken by mouth every two weeks for three months to a lower (100 mg) oral dose taken more often and 200 mg given by intramuscular injection, first weekly then every two weeks for six months. Side effects were poorly reported except for subjective sexual functioning, which did seem to improve with testosterone treatment. No trials investigated oestrogens in women with lower limb atherosclerosis. 
Trials by the Women's Health Initiative (published in 2004) have shown that oestrogen and progestin does not confer any protection against peripheral arterial disease in healthy postmenopausal women or reduce the risk of coronary events in postmenopausal women with coronary heart disease.","# Plain Language Summary: Steroid Sex Hormones for Leg Blood Vessel Disease

## What is this study about?
This review looked at whether steroid sex hormones (like testosterone) could help people with narrowed blood vessels in their legs.

## Why does this matter?
Scientists have noticed that steroid sex hormones might help reduce risk factors for leg blood vessel disease. Researchers wanted to know if giving these hormones to patients could actually improve their condition.

## What did researchers do?
The review team searched for studies that tested steroid sex hormones in patients with leg blood vessel problems. They looked for studies where some patients got the hormone and others got a fake treatment (placebo) to compare results fairly.

## What did they find?
The researchers found 3 good-quality studies that tested testosterone treatment. These studies included 109 people total who had leg pain when walking or serious leg blood flow problems.

**Results:** Testosterone treatment did not help patients walk farther or improve on other tests that measure leg blood flow and function. Patients who took testosterone did not report feeling significantly better than those who took placebo.

## What does this mean?
Based on the available evidence, testosterone treatment does not appear to help people with narrowed leg blood vessels in the short term. However, the researchers noted that there were very few studies available (the newest one was from 1971), so more research might be needed to be sure.

**Note:** No studies tested female hormones in women with this condition.","**Summary of Clinical Trial on Steroid Sex Hormones**

**Purpose of the Study**
This study looked at whether certain hormones can help treat people with a condition that affects blood flow in the legs, called lower limb atherosclerosis.

**How the Study was Done**
Researchers searched for previous medical studies on this topic, with no limits on language. They chose studies that were carefully designed and compared hormone treatments to no treatment or fake treatments (placebos).

**Study Details**
They found three studies where testosterone therapy was given to 109 people with leg blood flow problems. These studies were old, with the most recent from 1971. They couldn't find studies about hormone treatment for women with this condition.

**Findings**
The studies showed that testosterone did not help people walk better or improve blood flow in their legs. It also didn't significantly help with symptoms when compared to those who didn’t get the real treatment.

**Conclusion**
Right now, there's no strong proof that short-term testosterone treatments help with this leg condition. More research might be needed to find better answers, as the data we have is limited."
"Background
Stroke affects millions of people every year and is a leading cause of disability, resulting in significant financial cost and reduction in quality of life. Rehabilitation after stroke aims to reduce disability by facilitating recovery of impairment, activity, or participation. One aspect of stroke rehabilitation that may affect outcomes is the amount of time spent in rehabilitation, including minutes provided, frequency (i.e. days per week of rehabilitation), and duration (i.e. time period over which rehabilitation is provided). Effect of time spent in rehabilitation after stroke has been explored extensively in the literature, but findings are inconsistent. Previous systematic reviews with meta‐analyses have included studies that differ not only in the amount provided, but also type of rehabilitation. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of 1. more time spent in the same type of rehabilitation on activity measures in people with stroke; 2. difference in total rehabilitation time (in minutes) on recovery of activity in people with stroke; and 3. rehabilitation schedule on activity in terms of: a. average time (minutes) per week undergoing rehabilitation, b. frequency (number of sessions per week) of rehabilitation, and c. total duration of rehabilitation. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, eight other databases, and five trials registers to June 2021. We searched reference lists of identified studies, contacted key authors, and undertook reference searching using Web of Science Cited Reference Search. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with stroke that compared different amounts of time spent, greater than zero, in rehabilitation (any non‐pharmacological, non‐surgical intervention aimed to improve activity after stroke). Studies varied only in the amount of time in rehabilitation between experimental and control conditions. Primary outcome was activities of daily living (ADLs); secondary outcomes were activity measures of upper and lower limbs, motor impairment measures of upper and lower limbs, and serious adverse events (SAE)/death. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened studies, extracted data, assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool, and assessed certainty of the evidence using GRADE. For continuous outcomes using different scales, we calculated pooled standardised mean difference (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% CIs. 
Main results
The quantitative synthesis of this review comprised 21 parallel RCTs, involving analysed data from 1412 participants.  
Time in rehabilitation varied between studies. Minutes provided per week were 90 to 1288. Days per week of rehabilitation were three to seven. Duration of rehabilitation was two weeks to six months. Thirteen studies provided upper limb rehabilitation, five general rehabilitation, two mobilisation training, and one lower limb training. Sixteen studies examined participants in the first six months following stroke; the remaining five included participants more than six months poststroke. Comparison of stroke severity or level of impairment was limited due to variations in measurement. 
The risk of bias assessment suggests there were issues with the methodological quality of the included studies. There were 76 outcome‐level risk of bias assessments: 15 low risk, 37 some concerns, and 24 high risk. 
When comparing groups that spent more time versus less time in rehabilitation immediately after intervention, we found no difference in rehabilitation for ADL outcomes (SMD 0.13, 95% CI −0.02 to 0.28; P = 0.09; I2 = 7%; 14 studies, 864 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), activity measures of the upper limb (SMD 0.09, 95% CI −0.11 to 0.29; P = 0.36; I2 = 0%; 12 studies, 426 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and activity measures of the lower limb (SMD 0.25, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.53; P = 0.08; I2 = 48%; 5 studies, 425 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We found an effect in favour of more time in rehabilitation for motor impairment measures of the upper limb (SMD 0.32, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.58; P = 0.01; I2 = 10%; 9 studies, 287 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and of the lower limb (SMD 0.71, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.28; P = 0.01; 1 study, 51 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There were no intervention‐related SAEs. More time in rehabilitation did not affect the risk of SAEs/death (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.85; P = 0.68; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 379 participants; low‐certainty evidence), but few studies measured these outcomes. 
Predefined subgroup analyses comparing studies with a larger difference of total time spent in rehabilitation between intervention groups to studies with a smaller difference found greater improvements for studies with a larger difference. This was statistically significant for ADL outcomes (P = 0.02) and activity measures of the upper limb (P = 0.04), but not for activity measures of the lower limb (P = 0.41) or motor impairment measures of the upper limb (P = 0.06). 
Authors' conclusions
An increase in time spent in the same type of rehabilitation after stroke results in little to no difference in meaningful activities such as activities of daily living and activities of the upper and lower limb but a small benefit in measures of motor impairment (low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence for all findings). If the increase in time spent in rehabilitation exceeds a threshold, this may lead to improved outcomes. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend a minimum beneficial daily amount in clinical practice. The findings of this study are limited by a lack of studies with a significant contrast in amount of additional rehabilitation provided between control and intervention groups. 
Large, well‐designed, high‐quality RCTs that measure time spent in all rehabilitation activities (not just interventional) and provide a large contrast (minimum of 1000 minutes) in amount of rehabilitation between groups would provide further evidence for effect of time spent in rehabilitation.","Time spent in rehabilitation and effect on measures of activity after stroke
Review questionDoes more time spent in rehabilitation improve activity? What matters? Is it the total time spent in rehabilitation that is important, or is it the way rehabilitation is delivered (the schedule)? Is it, for example, the amount of time spent per week? Or the frequency of sessions? 
BackgroundStroke rehabilitation helps people who have had a stroke to recover and resume their activities. Different countries have different guidelines about the amount of therapy they should receive. In England, a minimum of 45 minutes of each appropriate therapy, every day is recommended. In Canada, the guidelines recommend more – three hours of task‐specific training, five days per week. Previous research has found no clear evidence in favour of one approach or the other: the effect of total time spent in rehabilitation, or the schedule by which it is delivered. The English recommendation of 45 minutes is based on the results of studies that compared different types of rehabilitation as well as different amounts of the same type of rehabilitation – which is not the same thing. This is why our review compares only different amounts of the same type of stroke rehabilitation. 
Study characteristicsWe included 21 studies amounting to 1412 people with stroke. Each study compared groups of people who had received different amounts of the same type of rehabilitation. Different types of rehabilitation were included, but the comparison within each study was always only different amounts of the same type. We included rehabilitation of the arms, legs, walking, and general rehabilitation. In 16 studies, participants were in the first six months after stroke. In the remaining five studies, participants were more than six months after stroke. 
Search dateWe searched for studies up to June 2021. 
Key resultsWe found that, for measures of activities involved in daily living (e.g. washing and dressing), activity measures of the arm (e.g. picking up an item), and activity measures of the leg (e.g. walking) there was neither harm to nor benefit for groups that received more rehabilitation compared with groups that received less. For measures of movement of the arm and leg (e.g. strength or range of movement), there was a benefit from receiving more rehabilitation. However, when we compared only the studies that had a bigger contrast between groups, there was a beneficial effect from additional therapy in terms of daily living activities, activity measures of the arm and leg, and movement measures of the arm. This suggests that people with stroke need a large amount of extra rehabilitation for it to make a difference in their recovery and ability to do everyday activities. 
Certainty of the evidenceCertainty of the evidence, which is measured by the quality of each of the studies included in the review, was either low or very low. Therefore, we can only draw tentative conclusions from the findings of this review. It also indicates that more, better quality, studies are needed.","# Plain Language Summary: Rehabilitation Time After Stroke

## What is this study about?

This study looked at whether spending more time in rehabilitation helps people recover better after a stroke. Researchers wanted to find out if the amount of rehabilitation time—measured in minutes per week, number of sessions per week, or total weeks of treatment—makes a difference in how well people recover.

## Why is this important?

Stroke is a serious health event that affects millions of people each year and can cause long-term disability. Rehabilitation (therapy and training) helps people regain abilities after a stroke. However, doctors and patients don't know for certain how much rehabilitation time is best.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at 21 studies involving 1,412 people who had a stroke. These studies compared groups of people who received different amounts of rehabilitation time. Some people got more minutes of therapy per week, more sessions per week, or longer total treatment periods than others. All studies looked at the same type of therapy—just different amounts.

## What did they measure?

Researchers tracked whether people improved in:
- Daily activities (like eating, dressing, and bathing)
- Arm and leg movement and strength
- Serious side effects or death

## What did they find?

**Main findings:**
- Spending more time in rehabilitation did **not** lead to better performance in daily activities or arm and leg activities
- More rehabilitation time showed a **small benefit** for muscle strength and control in the arms and legs
- No serious side effects were linked to more rehabilitation time
- When studies had a much bigger difference in rehabilitation time between groups, results were slightly better

## What does this mean?

Getting more rehabilitation time after a stroke probably doesn't help people do everyday activities much better. However, it may help a little with muscle strength. There isn't enough evidence yet to say exactly how much rehabilitation time is best for patients.

## What's next?

Researchers need larger, better-designed studies to understand the right amount of rehabilitation time for stroke recovery.","### Plain Language Summary

**Purpose of the Study:**
This study looked at how spending different amounts of time in rehabilitation can help people recover after a stroke. It focused on whether more time in therapy improves daily activities and movement skills.

**Who Was Involved:**
The study included 1,412 adults who had experienced a stroke. They participated in 21 different studies where they were given varying amounts of rehabilitation time.

**What They Did:**
Researchers compared groups that had more rehabilitation time with those that had less. They looked at:

1. How time spent in therapy affected daily activities, like getting dressed or eating.
2. Improvement in arm and leg movement.
3. How many days a week and how long in total rehabilitation lasted (some ranged from two weeks to six months).

**What They Found:**
- More therapy time didn't make much difference in daily activities.
- A bit of improvement was seen in movement skills, especially in the arms.
- There were no major safety issues with having more therapy time.

**Conclusion:**
Spending more time in therapy can slightly help with movement after a stroke. However, it didn’t make a big difference in daily activities. To really tell how much therapy is needed, better studies with clear differences in therapy time are needed.

**Going Forward:**
Future studies should focus on larger differences in therapy time to better understand how much is needed for best recovery."
"Background
Water immersion during labour and birth is increasingly popular and is becoming widely accepted across many countries, and particularly in midwifery‐led care settings. However, there are concerns around neonatal water inhalation, increased requirement for admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), maternal and/or neonatal infection, and obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS). This is an update of a review last published in 2011. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of water immersion during labour and/or birth (first, second and third stage of labour) on women and their infants. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (18 July 2017), and reference lists of retrieved trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing water immersion with no immersion, or other non‐pharmacological forms of pain management during labour and/or birth in healthy low‐risk women at term gestation with a singleton fetus. Quasi‐RCTs and cluster‐RCTs were eligible for inclusion but none were identified. Cross‐over trials were not eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Two review authors assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
This review includes 15 trials conducted between 1990 and 2015 (3663 women): eight involved water immersion during the first stage of labour; two during the second stage only; four during the first and second stages of labour, and one comparing early versus late immersion during the first stage of labour. No trials evaluated different baths/pools, or third‐stage labour management. All trials were undertaken in a hospital labour ward setting, with a varying degree of medical intervention considered as routine practice. No study was carried out in a midwifery‐led care setting. Most trial authors did not specify the parity of women. Trials were subject to varying degrees of bias: the intervention could not be blinded and there was a lack of information about randomisation, and whether analyses were undertaken by intention‐to‐treat. 
Immersion in water versus no immersion (first stage of labour) 
There is probably little or no difference in spontaneous vaginal birth between immersion and no immersion (83% versus 82%; risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.04; 6 trials; 2559 women; moderate‐quality evidence); instrumental vaginal birth (12% versus 14%; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.05; 6 trials; 2559 women; low‐quality evidence); and caesarean section (5% versus 4%; RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.79; 7 trials; 2652 women; low‐quality evidence). There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of immersion on estimated blood loss (mean difference (MD) ‐14.33 mL, 95% CI ‐63.03 to 34.37; 2 trials; 153 women; very low‐quality evidence) and third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (3% versus 3%; RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.18; 4 trials; 2341 women; moderate‐quality evidence). There was a small reduction in the risk of using regional analgesia for women allocated to water immersion from 43% to 39% (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.99; 5 trials; 2439 women; moderate‐quality evidence). Perinatal deaths were not reported, and there is insufficient evidence to determine the impact on neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions (6% versus 6%; average RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.97; 2 trials; 1511 infants; I² = 36%; low‐quality evidence), or on neonatal infection rates (1% versus 1%; RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.50 to 7.94; 5 trials; 1295 infants; very low‐quality evidence). 
Immersion in water versus no immersion (second stage of labour) 
There were no clear differences between groups for spontaneous vaginal birth (98% versus 97%; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08; 120 women; 1 trial; low‐quality evidence); instrumental vaginal birth (2% versus 2%; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.62; 1 trial; 120 women; very low‐quality evidence); caesarean section (0% versus 2%; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.02; 1 trial; 120 women; very low‐quality evidence), and NICU admissions (8% versus 11%; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.59; 2 trials; 291 women; very low‐quality evidence). Use of regional analgesia was not relevant to the second stage of labour. Third‐ or fourth‐degree tears, and estimated blood loss were not reported in either trial. No trial reported neonatal infection but did report neonatal temperature less than 36.2°C at birth (9% versus 9%; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.20; 1 trial; 109 infants; very low‐quality evidence), greater than 37.5°C at birth (15% versus 6%; RR 2.62, 95% CI 0.73 to 9.35; 1 trial; 109 infants; very low‐quality evidence), and fever reported in first week (2% versus 5%; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.82; 1 trial; 171 infants; very low‐quality evidence), with no clear effect between groups being observed. One perinatal death occurred in the immersion group in one trial (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.20; 1 trial; 120 infants; very low‐quality evidence). The infant was born to a mother with HIV and the cause of death was deemed to be intrauterine infection. 
There is no evidence of increased adverse effects to the baby or woman from either the first or second stage of labour. 
Only one trial (200 women) compared early and late entry into the water and there were insufficient data to show any clear differences. 
Authors' conclusions
In healthy women at low risk of complications there is moderate to low‐quality evidence that water immersion during the first stage of labour probably has little effect on mode of birth or perineal trauma, but may reduce the use of regional analgesia. The evidence for immersion during the second stage of labour is limited and does not show clear differences on maternal or neonatal outcomes intensive care. There is no evidence of increased adverse effects to the fetus/neonate or woman from labouring or giving birth in water. Available evidence is limited by clinical variability and heterogeneity across trials, and no trial has been conducted in a midwifery‐led setting.","Immersion in water in labour and birth
What is the issue? 
To assess the effects of water immersion (waterbirth) during labour and/or birth (first, second and third stage of labour) on women and their infants. 
Why is this important? 
Many women choose to labour and give birth in water (water immersion) and this practice is becoming more popular in many countries, particularly in midwifery‐led units. Therefore, it is important to understand more about the benefits of water immersion in labour and birth for women and their newborns, along with any risks. 
It is important to examine whether immersion in water during the first and/or the second stage of labour has the potential to maximise women's ability to manage labour pain, and to have a normal birth without increasing the risk of an adverse (harmful) event. Adverse events might be an increased risk of infection for women and/or their newborn; an increased likelihood of a serious tear to the perineum (the area between anus and vagina), and it may make estimating blood loss more difficult in the event of a haemorrhage. In assessing the benefits, we consider well‐being to cover both physical and psychological health. 
What evidence did we find? 
We included 15 trials (3663 women). All the trials compared immersion in water with no immersion in water: eight during the first stage of labour, two during the second stage of labour (waterbirth) only, four during the first and second stages of labour, and one early versus late immersion during the first stage of labour. The evidence was of moderate to very low quality. No trial compared immersion in water with other forms of pain management. 
Water immersion during the first stage of labour probably results in fewer women having an epidural, but probably makes little or no difference to the number of women who have a normal vaginal birth, instrumental birth, caesarean section or a serious perineal tear. We are uncertain about the effect on the amount of blood loss after birth because the quality of the evidence was very low. Labouring in water also may make little or no difference to babies being admitted to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or developing infections. Stillbirths and baby deaths were not reported. 
Two trials compared water immersion during the second stage (birth) with no immersion. We found that immersion may make little or no difference in numbers of women who have a normal vaginal birth. It is uncertain whether immersion makes any difference to instrumental vaginal births, caesarean sections, numbers of babies admitted to NICU, babies' temperatures at birth and fever in babies during the first week, because the quality of the evidence was found to be very low for all of these outcomes. Epidurals were not relevant to this stage of labour. Serious perineal tears and blood loss after birth were not reported in either trial. 
Only one trial (200 women) compared women who got into the water early and late in their labour but there was not enough information to show any clear differences between the groups. 
What does this mean? 
Labouring in water may reduce the number of women having an epidural. Giving birth in water did not appear to affect mode of birth, or the number of women having a serious perineal tear. This review found no evidence that labouring in water increases the risk of an adverse outcome for women or their newborns. The trials varied in quality and further research is needed particularly for waterbirth and its use in birth settings outside hospital labour wards before we can be more certain of these effects. Research is also needed about women’s and caregivers experiences of labour and birth in water.","# Plain Language Summary: Water Immersion During Labor and Birth

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether laboring or giving birth in water is safe and helpful for women and babies. More hospitals and birthing centers are offering water immersion, but some doctors worry it might cause problems. This summary updates information from a study done in 2011.

## Who was studied?

The review included 15 studies with 3,663 healthy women who were having babies at full term (not early). All women were low-risk, meaning they didn't have serious health problems. The studies were done between 1990 and 2015, all in hospital labor wards.

## What was tested?

Researchers compared women who used water during labor or birth to women who did not use water. Some studies looked at water use during early labor, some during pushing, and some during both stages.

## Main findings

**During early labor:**
- About the same number of women had vaginal births whether they used water or not (83% vs. 82%)
- Cesarean section rates were similar in both groups
- Women in water used slightly less pain medication (39% vs. 43%)
- No clear differences in tears or blood loss
- No increase in baby problems or infections

**During pushing:**
- Very few studies looked at this stage
- Results were similar between groups
- No clear differences in birth type or baby admissions to intensive care

## Safety

There was **no evidence of harm** to babies or mothers from laboring or giving birth in water.

## What this means

For healthy, low-risk women, water immersion during labor probably doesn't change how babies are born, but it may help reduce the need for pain medication. Water immersion appears to be safe.","**Plain Language Summary: Water Births**

**Purpose of the Study:**
This study looked at whether being in water during different stages of labor helps mothers and babies. It updated previous research from 2011.

**Who Took Part:**
The study involved healthy women expecting one baby, at full-term pregnancy. It compared those using water during labor to those who didn't, or who used other pain relief methods.

**Study Details:**
- Researchers checked multiple medical databases to find relevant studies.
- They included and analyzed 15 different studies from 1990 to 2015, involving 3,663 women.
- All studies took place in hospital settings, not in midwife-led environments.

**Findings:**
- **First Stage of Labor:**
  - Water use made little difference in the type of birth (natural, assisted, or C-section).
  - Women in water slightly less often needed heavy pain relief (like epidurals).
  - No clear differences in blood loss or serious tears.
  - Similar rates of babies needing intensive care or having infections.

- **Second Stage of Labor:**
  - Again, little difference in birth type and care needed for babies.
  - No major differences in baby health outcomes between water and non-water births.
  - No extra risks to mothers or babies from using water.

**Safety:**
- No increased harm to mothers or babies from using water during labor.

**Conclusion:**
For healthy women at low risk, using water during labor seems safe but doesn't make a big difference in birth type or baby care needed. More studies are needed, especially in settings with midwives."
"Background
It has been postulated that monoamine oxidase B (MAO‐B) inhibitors alter disease progression in Parkinson's disease (PD) but trials have produced conflicting results. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of long‐term use of MAO‐B inhibitors compared with other dopaminergic agents in early PD. 
Search methods
We searched several electronic databases including: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2009), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February 2009) and EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2009). We also handsearched neurology and movement disorders conference proceedings, checked reference lists of relevant studies and contacted other researchers. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials that compared a MAO‐B inhibitor with other dopaminergic agents (presently levodopa or dopamine agonists) in patients with early PD, where treatment and follow up lasted at least one year. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the methodological quality, and extracted the data. Additional data were provided by the original authors. Random‐effects models were used to analyse results, where appropriate. 
Main results
Only two eligible trials were included (593 patients), both of reasonable quality although one was unblinded. Both trials compared selegiline with a dopamine agonist, whilst one also compared selegiline with levodopa. MAO‐B inhibitors were not associated with a significant increase or decrease in deaths compared with levodopa (odds ratio (OR) 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 1.76) or dopamine agonists (OR 1.30; 95% CI 0.69 to 2.45). Those receiving MAO‐B inhibitors were more likely to require add‐on therapy during follow‐up than those receiving levodopa (OR 12.02; 95% CI 6.78 to 21.31) or dopamine agonist (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.05 to 3.81). There was a reduction in motor fluctuations with MAO‐B inhibitors compared with levodopa (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.94) but not dopamine agonists (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.65 to 2.05). Withdrawals due to adverse events were less common with MAO‐B inhibitors than with dopamine agonists (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.99). 
Authors' conclusions
MAO‐B inhibitors are one option for the early treatment of PD although they have weaker symptomatic effects than levodopa and dopamine agonists. They may reduce the rate of motor fluctuations compared with initial levodopa therapy and may have fewer significant adverse effects than the older agonists but data are too few to provide reliable conclusions.","Monoamine oxidase B inhibitors compared with other treatments in early Parkinson's
Many of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease are due to the loss of certain groups of nerves in the brain, which results in the lack of a chemical called dopamine. Currently, there are several different treatments available for people with newly diagnosed Parkinson's including levodopa (Sinemet or Madopar) which is converted into dopamine in the brain, dopamine agonists (for example, ropinirole and pramipexole) which mimic the action of dopamine, and monoamine oxidase B (MAO‐B) inhibitors (selegiline or rasagiline) which reduce the breakdown of dopamine in the brain. Each of these types of drugs has theoretical advantages and disadvantages. For example, although a very good treatment, levodopa can cause involuntary movements (dyskinesia), painful cramps (dystonia) and a shortened response to each dose (motor fluctuations) after a while, whilst MAO‐B inhibitors and dopamine agonists may reduce the risk of these complications but are not so good at improving the symptoms of Parkinson's. At present, therefore, it is not clear which of these three groups of drugs should be prescribed when people with early Parkinson's first need treatment. We reviewed the trials that compared giving MAO‐B inhibitors with other types of medication in people with early Parkinson's to see if there was good evidence that MAO‐B inhibitors were the best treatment to offer. However, unfortunately we only identified two trials (593 patients) so there was only limited evidence. The results showed that MAO‐B inhibitors were less good at improving the symptoms of Parkinson's than either levodopa or dopamine agonists but that they may reduce motor fluctuations compared with levodopa, though not compared with dopamine agonists. MAO‐B inhibitors did, however, have fewer major side effects than some dopamine agonists.","# Plain Language Summary: MAO-B Inhibitors for Early Parkinson's Disease

## What is this study about?
This review looked at whether a type of medicine called MAO-B inhibitors helps people with early Parkinson's disease. Researchers wanted to know if these medicines work well and are safe when used for a long time compared to other Parkinson's medicines.

## Who was studied?
The review included 593 patients from two research studies. All patients had early Parkinson's disease and took their medicines for at least one year.

## What medicines were compared?
- **MAO-B inhibitors** (a medicine called selegiline)
- **Other Parkinson's medicines**: levodopa and dopamine agonists

## What did researchers find?

**Safety:** MAO-B inhibitors did not cause more deaths than the other medicines. People taking MAO-B inhibitors had fewer reasons to stop their medicine due to side effects compared to those taking dopamine agonists.

**How well they worked:** MAO-B inhibitors were weaker at controlling symptoms than levodopa and dopamine agonists. Most people taking MAO-B inhibitors needed to add another medicine during the study, more often than people taking the other medicines.

**Movement problems:** MAO-B inhibitors reduced shaking and stiffness problems compared to levodopa, but not compared to dopamine agonists.

## Bottom line
MAO-B inhibitors are an option for early Parkinson's disease, but they don't work as well as other common medicines. More research is needed to be sure about their benefits and risks.","**Study Summary**

**Purpose of the Study**
This study looked at how safe and effective MAO-B inhibitors are when used for a long time in people with early Parkinson's disease. These were compared to other common treatments.

**Who Was Involved**
The study included 593 people with early Parkinson's disease.

**What Was Done**
Researchers compared MAO-B inhibitors, specifically selegiline, with other treatments like levodopa and dopamine agonists over at least one year.

**Key Findings**
- MAO-B inhibitors did not significantly change the number of deaths compared to other treatments.
- People using MAO-B inhibitors were more likely to need extra treatments sooner than those using levodopa or dopamine agonists. 
- MAO-B inhibitors helped reduce movement problems compared to levodopa but not compared to dopamine agonists.
- Fewer people stopped using MAO-B inhibitors due to side effects compared to those using dopamine agonists.

**Conclusion**
MAO-B inhibitors can be a choice for early treatment of Parkinson's. They might have fewer side effects and reduce movement problems compared to some treatments, but they are generally not as strong for symptoms. More research is needed for clear conclusions."
"Background
Up to 80% of hospitalised patients receive intravenous therapy at some point during their admission. About 20% to 70% of patients receiving intravenous therapy develop phlebitis. Infusion phlebitis has become one of the most common complications in patients with intravenous therapy. However, the effects of routine treatments such as external application of 75% alcohol or 50% to 75% magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) are unsatisfactory. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new methods to prevent and alleviate infusion phlebitis. 
Objectives
To systematically assess the effects of external application of Aloe vera for the prevention and treatment of infusion phlebitis associated with the presence of an intravenous access device. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co‐ordinator (TSC) searched the Specialised Register (last searched February 2014) and CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1). In addition the TSC searched MEDLINE to week 5 January 2014, EMBASE to Week 6 2014 and AMED to February 2014. The authors searched the following Chinese databases until 28 February 2014: Chinese BioMedical Database; Traditional Chinese Medical Database System; China National Knowledge Infrastructure; Chinese VIP information; Chinese Medical Current Contents; Chinese Academic Conference Papers Database and Chinese Dissertation Database; and China Medical Academic Conference. Bibliographies of retrieved and relevant publications were searched. There were no restrictions on the basis of date or language of publication. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised controlled trials (qRCTs) were included if they involved participants receiving topical Aloe vera or Aloe vera‐derived products at the site of punctured skin, with or without routine treatment at the same site. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted the data on the study characteristics, description of methodology and outcomes of the eligible trials, and assessed study quality. Data were analysed using RevMan 5.1. For dichotomous outcomes, the effects were estimated by using risk ratio (RR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs were used to estimate their effects. 
Main results
A total of 43 trials (35 RCTs and eight qRCTs) with 7465 participants were identified. Twenty‐two trials with 5546 participants were involved in prevention of Aloe vera for phlebitis, and a further 21 trials with 1919 participants were involved in the treatment of phlebitis. The included studies compared external application of Aloe vera alone or plus non‐Aloe vera interventions with no treatment or the same non‐Aloe vera interventions. The duration of the intervention lasted from one day to 15 days. Most of the included studies were of low methodological quality with concerns for selection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and publication bias. 
The effects of external application of fresh Aloe vera on preventing total incidence of phlebitis varied across the studies and we did not combine the data. Aloe vera reduced the occurrence of third degree phlebitis (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.11, P < 0.00001) and second degree phlebitis (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.31, P < 0.00001) compared with no treatment. Compared with external application of 75% alcohol, or 33% MgSO4 alone, Aloe vera reduced the total incidence of phlebitis (RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.28, P = 0.004 and RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.78, P = 0.005 respectively) but there was no clear evidence of an effect when compared with 50% or 75% MgSO4 (total incidence of phlebitis RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.07, P = 0.07 and RR 1.10 95% CI 0.54 to 2.25, P = 0.79 respectively; third degree phlebitis (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.02, P = 0.051 and RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.08 to 18.73, P = 0.9 respectively; second degree phlebitis RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.23, P = 0.53 compared to 75% MgSO4) except for a reduction in second degree phlebitis when Aloe vera was compared with 50% MgSO4 (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.50, P < 0.0001). 
For the treatment of phlebitis, Aloe vera was more effective than 33% or 50% MgSO4 in terms of both any improvement (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.24, P < 0.0001 and RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.28, P < 0.0001 respectively) and marked improvement of phlebitis (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.70, P < 0.001 and RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.87, P = 0.0002 respectively). Compared with 50% MgSO4, Aloe vera also improved recovery rates from phlebitis (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.61, P < 0.0001). Compared with routine treatments such as external application of hirudoid, sulphonic acid mucopolysaccharide and dexamethasone used alone, addition of Aloe vera improved recovery from phlebitis (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.46, P = 0.001) and had a positive effect on overall improvement (marked improvement RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.47, P = 0.0003; any improvement RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.35, P < 0.0001). Aloe vera, either alone or in combination with routine treatment, was more effective than routine treatment alone for improving the symptoms of phlebitis including shortening the time of elimination of red swelling symptoms, time of pain relief at the location of the infusion vein and time of resolution of phlebitis. Other secondary outcomes including health‐related quality of life and adverse effects were not reported in the included studies. 
Authors' conclusions
There is no strong evidence for preventing or treating infusion phlebitis with external application of Aloe vera. The current available evidence is limited by the poor methodological quality and risk of selective outcome reporting of the included studies, and by variation in the size of effect across the studies. The positive effects observed with external application of Aloe vera in preventing or treating infusion phlebitis compared with no intervention or external application of 33% or 50% MgSO4 should therefore be viewed with caution.","Aloe vera for prevention and treatment of infusion phlebitis
Infusion phlebitis is acute inflammation of a vein in the presence of intravenous therapy. In modern medical practice, more than 80% of inpatients will receive intravenous therapy during their admission, and about 20% to 70% of them may develop infusion phlebitis. Therefore infusion phlebitis is the most common complication of intravenous therapy. However, routine treatments for prevention or treatment of phlebitis such as external application of 75% alcohol or 50% to 75% magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) are unsatisfactory. 
This review examined 35 randomised controlled trials and eight quasi‐randomised controlled trials with 7465 participants. Twenty‐two trials with 5546 participants were involved in looking at prevention of phlebitis with Aloe vera, and a further 21 trials with 1919 participants were involved in looking at Aloe vera for the treatment of phlebitis. The included trials mainly compared external application of fresh Aloe vera alone or with another non‐Aloe vera treatment such as a wet compress of 75% alcohol or 33%, 50% or 75% MgSO4 with no treatment or the same non‐Aloe vera treatment. The duration of intervention lasted from one day to 15 days. Most of the included studies were of low methodological quality with concerns for selection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and publication bias. The incidence of phlebitis at varying degrees of severity as well as the resolution rate and level of improvement of phlebitis were investigated. 
The available evidence suggests that external application of fresh Aloe vera alone or combined with other non‐Aloe vera treatment may be effective for the prevention and treatment of infusion phlebitis resulting from the intravenous therapy. The conclusions should be cautiously interpreted due to the low methodological quality of the included trials.","# Plain Language Summary: Aloe Vera for IV Line Complications

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether applying Aloe vera to the skin around an IV line (a tube that delivers medicine into your vein) can prevent or treat a common problem called phlebitis. Phlebitis is swelling, redness, and pain that happens when an IV line irritates the vein.

## Why is this important?

Many hospital patients get IV lines during their stay. Between 20% and 70% of these patients develop phlebitis. Current treatments like alcohol or magnesium sulphate don't work very well, so doctors are looking for better options.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers reviewed 43 studies involving 7,465 people to see if Aloe vera worked better than other treatments or no treatment at all. They looked at studies that tested Aloe vera applied to the skin around the IV line.

## What did they find?

**For preventing phlebitis:**
- Aloe vera seemed to help prevent severe swelling and redness compared to no treatment
- Aloe vera worked better than alcohol or weaker magnesium sulphate solutions
- Results were unclear when compared to stronger magnesium sulphate

**For treating phlebitis:**
- Aloe vera helped people recover faster than magnesium sulphate alone
- Adding Aloe vera to standard treatments helped more than standard treatments by themselves
- It helped reduce pain, swelling, and redness faster

## Important limitations

The studies had quality problems that make the results less trustworthy. Researchers warn that the positive results should be viewed carefully and more high-quality research is needed.","### Plain Language Summary

The researchers wanted to see if putting Aloe vera on the skin could stop phlebitis or make it better compared to other treatments.

#### Who Was Involved?
There were 43 different studies, with a total of 7,465 people taking part. They studied the effects of Aloe vera on those who were receiving medicine through a needle.

#### What Did They Do?
- Aloe vera was applied to the skin.
- It was sometimes used alone or with other treatments.
- They checked for improvement over one to 15 days.

#### What Did They Find?
- Aloe vera helped reduce more serious cases of phlebitis better than not using anything at all.
- It worked better than some other treatments like 33% or 50% magnesium sulfate.
- Aloe vera helped people get better faster when combined with other routine treatments.

#### Was It Safe?
The studies did not report on side effects or how using Aloe vera might affect overall health.

#### Conclusion
Using Aloe vera might help with preventing and treating phlebitis, but the evidence is not strong because the studies had some problems. So, the results should be considered carefully."
"Background
People with atrial fibrillation (AF) often undergo cardiac surgery for other underlying reasons and are frequently offered concomitant AF surgery to reduce the frequency of short‐ and long‐term AF and improve short‐ and long‐term outcomes. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of concomitant AF surgery among people with AF who are undergoing cardiac surgery on short‐term and long‐term (12 months or greater) health‐related outcomes, health‐related quality of life, and costs. 
Search methods
Starting from the year when the first “maze” AF surgery was reported (1987), we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library (March 2016), MEDLINE Ovid (March 2016), Embase Ovid (March 2016), Web of Science (March 2016), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE, April 2015), and Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA, March 2016). We searched trial registers in April 2016. We used no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of any concomitant AF surgery compared with no AF surgery among adults with preoperative AF, regardless of symptoms, who were undergoing cardiac surgery for another indication. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. We evaluated the risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We included outcome data on all‐cause and cardiovascular‐specific mortality, freedom from atrial fibrillation, flutter, or tachycardia off antiarrhythmic medications, as measured by patient electrocardiographic monitoring greater than three months after the procedure, procedural safety, 30‐day rehospitalisation, need for post‐discharge direct current cardioversion, health‐related quality of life, and direct costs. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed‐effect model when heterogeneity was low (I² ≤ 50%) and random‐effects model when heterogeneity was high (I² > 50%). We evaluated the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to create a 'Summary of findings' table. 
Main results
We found 34 reports of 22 trials (1899 participants) with five additional ongoing studies and three studies awaiting classification. All included studies were assessed as having high risk of bias across at least one domain. The effect of concomitant AF surgery on all‐cause mortality was uncertain when compared with no concomitant AF surgery (7.0% versus 6.6%, RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.59, I² = 0%, 20 trials, 1829 participants, low‐quality evidence), but the intervention increased freedom from atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia off antiarrhythmic medications > three months (51.0% versus 24.1%, RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.55, I² = 0%, eight trials, 649 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). The effect of concomitant AF surgery on 30‐day mortality was uncertain (2.3% versus 3.1%, RR 1.25 95% CI 0.71 to 2.20, I² = 0%, 18 trials, 1566 participants, low‐quality evidence), but the intervention increased the risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (6.0% versus 4.1%, RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.54, I² = 0%, 18 trials, 1726 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). Investigator‐defined adverse events, including but limited to, need for surgical re‐exploration or mediastinitis, were not routinely reported but were not different between the two groups (other adverse events: 24.8% versus 23.6%, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.34, I² = 45%, nine trials, 858 participants), but the quality of this evidence was very low. 
Authors' conclusions
For patients with AF undergoing cardiac surgery, there is moderate‐quality evidence that concomitant AF surgery approximately doubles the risk of freedom from atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia off anti‐arrhythmic drugs while increasing the risk of permanent pacemaker implantation. The effects on mortality are uncertain. Future, high‐quality and adequately powered trials will likely affect the confidence on the effect estimates of AF surgery on clinical outcomes.","Atrial fibrillation surgery for patients undergoing heart surgery
Review question  What is the evidence about potential benefits and harms of concomitant atrial fibrillation surgery in people who have atrial fibrillation and are undergoing heart surgery?  Background  People who undergo heart surgery may have an abnormal heart rhythm disorder known as atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of developing a stroke. Some patients may experience symptoms of palpitations, and many patients are recommended to take blood thinners to reduce their risk of having a stroke. Many surgeons will offer patients a procedure to treat this heart rhythm disorder at the same time of a heart surgery.  The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effects of this heart rhythm procedure, known as atrial fibrillation surgery, at the time of heart surgery.  Study characteristics  We searched scientific databases in March 2016 and found 22 randomised trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) including 1899 adults that met our inclusion criteria. Most trials had at least one methodological limitation. Funding for most trials was either not reported or came from intramural funds or national funding bodies, including professional and governmental organisations.  Key results  There is uncertainty about the effect of atrial fibrillation surgery on all‐cause mortality because rates were similar between individuals who underwent the additional procedure to treat their atrial fibrillation and those who did not. Individuals who underwent this additional procedure were twice as likely to be free from atrial fibrillation and off medications three months following the surgery (51% [range: 39% to 62%] compared with 24%), but these individuals were also more likely to need a pacemaker following the procedure (7% [range: 5% to 10%] compared with 4%). Other outcomes, including procedural safety, stroke risk, and health‐related quality of life were similar between the two groups, but there is uncertainty in the confidence of our estimates for these outcomes. We did not find any benefit of one type of atrial fibrillation surgical treatment compared with another.  Quality of the evidence  The quality of evidence supporting atrial fibrillation surgery to treat atrial fibrillation is low to moderate because of the limitations of the original studies. It is likely that further research may influence these results.","# Plain Language Summary: Heart Rhythm Surgery During Other Heart Surgery

## What is this study about?

Some people have an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation (AF). When these people need heart surgery for other reasons, doctors sometimes offer an extra procedure to fix the irregular heartbeat at the same time. This summary looks at whether doing both surgeries together is helpful.

## Who was studied?

The researchers looked at 22 different studies involving 1,899 adults who had atrial fibrillation and were having heart surgery. They compared two groups: people who had the extra AF surgery and people who did not.

## What did they test?

Researchers wanted to know if the extra AF surgery helped with:
- Survival rates (both overall and within 30 days)
- Keeping a normal heart rhythm without needing heart rhythm medications
- Safety and side effects
- Hospital readmissions
- Quality of life

## Main findings

**Good news:**
- People who had the extra AF surgery were about twice as likely to have a normal heart rhythm after surgery (without needing medications).

**Concerns:**
- More people in the AF surgery group needed a pacemaker implanted (a small device that helps the heart beat regularly).
- The effect on survival was unclear—the surgery did not clearly help people live longer.

**Other side effects:**
- Overall complications were similar between both groups.

## Bottom line

The extra AF surgery works well at restoring normal heart rhythm, but it increases the need for pacemakers. Whether it helps people live longer is still unclear. Doctors and patients should discuss these benefits and risks together.","### Plain Language Summary

#### Why Was This Study Done?
Many people with a heart condition called atrial fibrillation (AF) have heart surgery for other reasons. Sometimes, they also get extra surgery to help with AF. This study looked at whether this extra surgery helps improve health and quality of life.

#### What Was the Study About?
The study checked if adding AF surgery during other heart surgeries helps people in the short term and long term (12 months or more). It also looked at costs and how it affects quality of life.

#### How Was the Study Done?
Researchers looked at studies from 1987 to 2016. They included research that compared people who had AF surgery with those who didn’t during other heart operations. They wanted to see the difference in survival rates, heart rhythm problems, and other health measures.

#### What Did the Study Find?
- **Heart Rhythm:** People who had the extra AF surgery were more likely to have a regular heart rhythm without needing medications (51% compared to 24%).
- **Survival:** The effect of AF surgery on staying alive was unclear.
- **Pacemakers:** More people needed a permanent pacemaker after having the extra AF surgery (6% compared to 4%).
- **Safety:** Safety results were similar between both groups, but there wasn’t strong evidence.

#### What Does This Mean?
For people having heart surgery who also have AF, the extra AF surgery can help keep the heart beating regularly without medication. But it also might mean needing a pacemaker. We’re not sure about the effects on survival. Better studies could help us understand more.

"Background
An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal ballooning of the major abdominal artery. Some AAAs present as emergencies and require surgery; others remain asymptomatic. Treatment of asymptomatic AAAs depends on many factors, but the size of the aneurysm is important, as risk of rupture increases with aneurysm size. Large asymptomatic AAAs (greater than 5.5 cm in diameter) are usually repaired surgically; very small AAAs (less than 4.0 cm diameter) are monitored with ultrasonography. Debate continues over the roles of early repair versus surveillance with repair on subsequent enlargement in people with asymptomatic AAAs of 4.0 cm to 5.5 cm diameter. This is the fourth update of the review first published in 1999. 
Objectives
To compare mortality and costs, as well as quality of life and aneurysm rupture as secondary outcomes, following early surgical repair versus routine ultrasound surveillance in people with asymptomatic AAAs between 4.0 cm and 5.5 cm in diameter. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, two other databases, and two trials registers to 10 July 2019. We handsearched conference proceedings and checked reference lists of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials where people with asymptomatic AAAs of 4.0 cm to 5.5 cm were randomly allocated to early repair or imaging‐based surveillance at least every six months. Outcomes had to include mortality or survival. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently extracted data, which were cross‐checked by other team members. Outcomes were mortality, costs, quality of life, and aneurysm rupture. For mortality, we estimated risk ratios (RR) (endovascular aneurysm repair only), hazard ratios (HR) (open repair only), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on Mantel‐Haenszel Chi2 statistics at one and six years (open repair only) following randomisation. 
Main results
We found no new studies for this update. Four trials with 3314 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Two trials compared early open repair with surveillance and two trials compared early endovascular repair (EVAR) with surveillance. We used GRADE to access the certainty of the evidence for mortality and cost, which ranged from high to low. We downgraded the certainty in the evidence from high to moderate and low due to risk of bias concerns and imprecision (some outcomes were only reported by one study). 
All four trials showed an early survival benefit in the surveillance group (due to 30‐day operative mortality with repair) but no evidence of differences in long‐term survival. One study compared early open repair with surveillance with an adjusted HR of 0.88 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.02, mean follow‐up 10 years; HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.54, mean follow‐up 4.9 years). Pooled analysis of participant‐level data from the two trials comparing early open repair with surveillance (maximum follow‐up seven to eight years) showed no evidence of a difference in survival (propensity score‐adjusted HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.18; 2226 participants; high‐certainty evidence). This lack of treatment effect did not vary to three years by AAA diameter (P = 0.39), participant age (P = 0.61), or for women (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.11). Two studies compared EVAR with surveillance and there was no evidence of a survival benefit for early EVAR at 12 months (RR 1.92, 95% CI 0.73 to 5.06; 846 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Two trials reported costs. The mean UK health service costs per participant over the first 18 months after randomisation were higher in the open repair surgery than the surveillance group (GBP 4978 in the repair group versus GBP 3914 in the surveillance group; mean difference (MD) GBP 1064, 95% CI 796 to 1332; 1090 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There was a similar difference after 12 years. The mean USA hospital costs for participants at six months after randomisation were higher in the EVAR group than in the surveillance group (USD 33,471 with repair versus USD 5520 with surveillance; MD USD 27,951, 95% CI 25,156 to 30,746; 614 participants; low‐certainty evidence). After four years, there was no evidence of a difference in total medical costs between groups (USD 48,669 with repair versus USD 46,112 with surveillance; MD USD 2557, 95% CI –8043 to 13,156; 614 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
All studies reported quality of life but used different assessment measurements and results were conflicting. 
All four studies reported aneurysm rupture. There were very few ruptures reported in the trials of EVAR versus surveillance up to three years. In the trials of open surgery versus surveillance, there were ruptures to at least six years and there were more ruptures in the surveillance group, but most of these ruptures occurred in aneurysms that had exceeded the threshold for surgical repair. 
Authors' conclusions
There was no evidence of an advantage to early repair for small AAA (4.0 cm to 5.5 cm), regardless of whether open repair or EVAR is used and, at least for open repair, regardless of patient age and AAA diameter. Thus, neither early open nor early EVAR of small AAAs is supported by currently available evidence. Long‐term data from the two trials investigating EVAR are not available, so, we can only draw firm conclusions regarding outcomes after the first few years for open repair. Research regarding the risks related to and management of small AAAs in ethnic minorities and women is urgently needed, as data regarding these populations are lacking.","Surgery for small abdominal aortic aneurysms that do not cause symptoms
Background 
An aneurysm is a ballooning of an artery (blood vessel), which, in the case of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), occurs in the major artery in the abdomen (aorta). Ruptured AAAs cause death unless surgical repair is rapid, which is difficult to achieve. Surgery is recommended for people with aneurysms bigger than 5.5 cm in diameter or who have associated pain, to relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of rupture and death. However, there are risks with surgery. Surgical repair consists of re‐lining the aorta with strong synthetic material, either by open surgery or endovascular repair (a minimally invasive keyhole procedure). Small asymptomatic (no symptoms) AAAs are at low risk of rupture and are monitored through regular imaging so they can be surgically repaired if they grow. 
Key results 
We found four well‐conducted trials that randomised 3314 participants with small (diameter 4.0 cm to 5.5 cm) asymptomatic AAAs to early repair or regular, routine ultrasounds to check for aneurysm growth (surveillance) (search current to 10 July 2019). In the surveillance group, the aneurysm was repaired if it was enlarging, reached 5.5 cm in diameter, or became symptomatic. The trials showed an early survival benefit in the surveillance group because of the number of deaths within 30 days of surgery (operative mortality). The trials found no difference in long‐term survival between early repair (open or endovascular) and surveillance over three to eight years of follow‐up. After three years, about 31% of the participants randomised to surveillance eventually had the aneurysm repaired, rising to 75% after 12 years. 
Two trials reported costs. For the first 18 months, costs were lower with surveillance than either open repair or endovascular repair. After four years, one trial found similar total medical costs for early endovascular repair and surveillance groups. After 12 years, another trial found lower hospital costs with surveillance than with open repair. 
The four studies used different ways to measure quality of life and results were conflicting. The percentage of aneurysm ruptures in the surveillance group appeared higher in the trials using open repair but these have not restricted participants to those with aortic anatomy suitable for endovascular repair. Most ruptures were in people whose previous aneurysm diameter exceeded the threshold for surgical repair. 
Reliability of the evidence 
The methods within the studies using open repair were good and the reliability of the evidence was high to moderate for the two trials comparing open repair with surveillance. For the two trials comparing endovascular repair with surveillance, the risk of bias was unclear to high and the reliability of the evidence was low. The four trials suggest no overall advantage with early surgery for small AAAs (4.0 cm to 5.5 cm). The two trials comparing early open surgical repair to surveillance found this result holds true regardless of patient age or aneurysm size (within the range of 4.0 cm to 5.5 cm diameter). Furthermore, the two trials that focused on endovascular repair, also found no benefit over surveillance. Neither early open nor early endovascular repair of small AAAs is supported by the current evidence.","# Plain Language Summary: Treatment of Small Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms

## What is this study about?

An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a bulging in a major blood vessel in the belly. Doctors need to decide whether to fix small aneurysms right away with surgery or watch them with regular ultrasound scans to see if they get bigger.

## Who was studied?

This review looked at four research studies involving 3,314 people who had small aneurysms (between 4.0 and 5.5 centimeters wide). These people did not have any symptoms.

## What were the two treatment options?

**Group 1:** People had surgery right away to repair the aneurysm.

**Group 2:** People had regular ultrasound scans (at least every six months) to watch the aneurysm. Surgery was done only if it got bigger.

## What did the studies find?

**Survival:** People who were watched with ultrasound scans actually did better in the first month after the study started (because surgery has risks). However, over several years, there was no real difference in how long people lived between the two groups.

**Cost:** Surgery upfront cost more money in the first 18 months. However, after four years, the total costs were similar between groups.

**Rupture (burst):** Very few aneurysms burst in either group. When ruptures did happen in the watched group, most of the aneurysms had already grown larger than the size that usually requires surgery.

**Quality of life:** The studies measured this differently, so results were mixed.

## What do the researchers conclude?

There is no clear benefit to fixing small aneurysms right away. Watching them with regular ultrasound scans appears to be a safe option. More research is needed in women and certain ethnic groups.","### Plain Language Summary

**What is the study about?**
This study looks at the best way to manage small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). An AAA is when a major artery in the belly balloons out. It can be dangerous if it bursts. For small AAAs that don't cause symptoms and are between 4.0 cm and 5.5 cm in size, doctors aren't sure whether to repair them early or just watch them with regular check-ups.

**What did the researchers want to find out?**
They wanted to compare death rates, costs, quality of life, and the chance of the aneurysm bursting between people who had early surgery and those who were just monitored with regular scans.

**How was the study done?**
The researchers looked at four studies with 3,314 people. These people were split into groups. Some had early surgeries, and others were monitored with regular ultrasound scans. They used different types of surgery: open repair and a less invasive method called EVAR.

**What did they find out?**
- **Survival:** People who were monitored (not having surgery right away) had a slightly better survival rate in the short term, but there was no long-term difference in survival between the groups.
- **Costs:** Surgery was more expensive, especially in the first year and a half, but costs were similar after a few years.
- **Ruptures:** Few aneurysms burst in the early years after monitoring. More ruptures happened in the monitoring group if AAAs grew too big and needed surgery.
- **Quality of Life:** The impact on quality of life was unclear because different studies measured it in different ways.

**What is the conclusion?**
There is no clear benefit to having early surgery for small AAAs. Monitoring with regular scans seems just as safe in the long run. More research is needed, especially for women and minority groups."
"Background
Low‐back pain (LBP) is a common condition and imposes a substantial economic burden upon people living in industrialized societies. A large proportion of people with chronic LBP use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), visit CAM practitioners, or both. Several herbal medicines have been purported for use in treating people with LBP. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of herbal medicine for non‐specific LBP.
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases up to September 2014: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Clinical Trials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Portal and PubMed; checked reference lists in review articles, guidelines and retrieved trials; and personally contacted individuals with expertise in this area. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining adults (over 18 years of age) suffering from acute, sub‐acute, or chronic non‐specific LBP. The interventions were herbal medicines which we defined as plants used for medicinal purposes in any form. Primary outcome measures were pain and function. 
Data collection and analysis
A library scientist with the Cochrane Back Review Group conducted the database searches. One review author contacted content experts and acquired relevant citations. We downloaded full references and abstracts of the identified studies and retrieved a hard copy of each study for final inclusion decisions. Two review authors assessed risk of bias, GRADE criteria (GRADE 2004), and CONSORT compliance and a random subset were compared to assessments by a third individual. Two review authors assessed clinical relevance and resolved any disagreements by consensus. 
Main results
We included 14 RCTs (2050 participants) in this review. One trial on Solidago chilensis M. (Brazilian arnica) (20 participants) found very low quality evidence of reduction in perception of pain and improved flexibility with application of Brazilian arnica‐containing gel twice daily as compared to placebo gel. Capsicum frutescens cream or plaster probably produces more favourable results than placebo in people with chronic LBP (three trials, 755 participants, moderate quality evidence). Based on current evidence, it is not clear whether topical capsicum cream is more beneficial for treating people with acute LBP compared to placebo (one trial, 40 participants, low quality evidence). Another trial found equivalence of C. frutescens cream to a homeopathic ointment (one trial, 161 participants, very low quality evidence). Daily doses of Harpagophytum procumbens (devil's claw), standardized to 50 mg or 100 mg harpagoside, may be better than placebo for short‐term improvements in pain and may reduce use of rescue medication (two trials, 315 participants, low quality evidence). Another H. procumbens trial demonstrated relative equivalence to 12.5 mg per day of rofecoxib (Vioxx®) but was of very low quality (one trial, 88 participants, very low quality). Daily doses of Salix alba (white willow bark), standardized to 120 mg or 240 mg salicin, are probably better than placebo for short‐term improvements in pain and rescue medication (two trials, 261 participants, moderate quality evidence). An additional trial demonstrated relative equivalence to 12.5 mg per day of rofecoxib (one trial, 228 participants) but was graded as very low quality evidence. S. alba minimally affected platelet thrombosis versus a cardioprotective dose of acetylsalicylate (one trial, 51 participants). One trial (120 participants) examining Symphytum officinale L. (comfrey root extract) found low quality evidence that a Kytta‐Salbe comfrey extract ointment is better than placebo ointment for short‐term improvements in pain as assessed by VAS. Aromatic lavender essential oil applied by acupressure may reduce subjective pain intensity and improve lateral spine flexion and walking time compared to untreated participants (one trial, 61 participants,very low quality evidence). No significant adverse events were noted within the included trials. 
Authors' conclusions
C. frutescens (Cayenne) reduces pain more than placebo. Although H. procumbens, S. alba, S. officinale L., S. chilensis, and lavender essential oil also seem to reduce pain more than placebo, evidence for these substances was of moderate quality at best. Additional well‐designed large trials are needed to test these herbal medicines against standard treatments. In general, the completeness of reporting in these trials was poor. Trialists should refer to the CONSORT statement extension for reporting trials of herbal medicine interventions.","Herbal medicine for low‐back pain
Review question 
We examined the evidence regarding the effect of herbal medicine on pain in people with non‐specific low‐back pain (LBP). 
Background Back pain is common and up to 35% of the population can be affected in a given month. Non‐specific LBP is defined as pain between the lowest rib and the bottom of the buttocks that is not caused by serious, underlying problems such as rheumatoid arthritis, infection, fracture, cancer, or sciatica due to a ruptured disc or other pressure on nerves. Herbal medicines taken orally or applied to the skin are being used to treat many conditions including back pain. 
Study characteristics Researchers from the Cochrane Collaboration examined the evidence available up to August 5, 2013. Fourteen studies tested six herbal medications and included 2050 adults with non‐specific acute or chronic LBP. Two oral herbal medications, Harpagophytum procumbens (devil's claw) and Salix alba (white willow bark), were compared to placebo (fake or sham pills) or to rofecoxib (Vioxx®). Three topical creams, plasters, or gels, Capsicum frutescens (cayenne), Symphytum officinale L. (comfrey), and Solidago chilensis (Brazilian arnica), were compared to placebo creams or plasters and a homeopathic gel. One essential oil, lavender, was compared to no treatment. The average age of people included in the trials was 52 years and studies usually lasted three weeks. 
Key results Devil's claw, in a standardized daily dose of 50 mg or 100 mg harpagoside, may reduce pain more than placebo; a standardized daily dose of 60 mg reduced pain about the same as a daily dose of 12.5 mg of Vioxx®. While willow bark, in a standardized daily dose of 120 mg and 240 mg of salicin reduced pain more than placebo; a standardized daily dose of 240 mg reduced pain about the same as a daily dose of 12.5 mg of Vioxx® (a non‐steroidal, anti‐inflammatory drug). Cayenne was tested in several forms: in plaster form, it reduced pain more than placebo and about the same as the homeopathic gel Spiroflor SLR. Two other ointment‐based medications, S. officinale and S. chilensis appeared to reduce perception of pain more than placebo creams. Lavender essential oil applied by acupressure appeared effective in reducing pain and improving flexibility compared to conventional treatment. Adverse effects were reported, but appeared to be primarily confined to mild, transient gastrointestinal complaints or skin irritations. 
Quality of the evidence Most included trials were at low risk of bias and the quality of the evidence was mainly very low to moderate. A moderate grade of evidence was only found for C. frutescens. Trials only tested the effects of short term use (up to six weeks). Authors of eight of the included trials had a potential conflict of interest and four other authors did not disclose conflicts of interest. Vioxx® has been withdrawn from the market because of adverse effects, so all three substances should be compared to readily‐available pain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen, for relative effectiveness and safety. 
Conclusion Low to moderate quality evidence shows that four herbal medicines may reduce pain in acute and chronic LBP in the short‐term and have few side effects. There is no evidence yet that any of these substances are safe or efficacious for long‐term use. Large, well‐designed trials are needed to further test the efficacy of these interventions.","# Plain Language Summary: Herbal Medicines for Low Back Pain

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether plant-based medicines (herbs) can help people with low back pain. Researchers searched for studies that tested different herbal treatments to see if they worked better than fake treatments (placebos).

"Background
Randomized trials investigating the efficacy of aminosalicylates for the treatment of mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease have yielded conflicting results. A systematic review was conducted to critically examine current available data on the efficacy of sulfasalazine and mesalamine for inducing remission or clinical response in these patients. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy of aminosalicylates compared to placebo, corticosteroids, and other aminosalicylates (alone or in combination with corticosteroids) for the treatment of mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease. 
Search methods
We searched PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Library from inception to June 2015 to identify relevant studies. There were no language restrictions. We also searched reference lists from potentially relevant papers and review articles, as well as proceedings from annual meetings (1991‐2015) of the American Gastroenterological Association and American College of Gastroenterology. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy of sulfasalazine or mesalamine in the treatment of mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease compared to placebo, corticosteroids, and other aminosalicylates (alone or in combination with corticosteroids) were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality was independently performed by the investigators and any disagreement was resolved by discussion and consensus. We assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. The primary outcome measure was a well defined clinical endpoint of induction of remission or response to treatment. Secondary outcomes included mean Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) scores, adverse events, serious adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse events. For dichotomous outcomes we calculated the pooled risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random‐effects model. For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI using a random‐effects model. Sensitivity analyses based on a fixed‐effect model and duration of therapy were conducted where appropriate. 
Main results
Twenty studies (2367 patients) were included. Two studies were judged to be at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. Eight studies were judged to be at high risk of bias due to incomplete outcomes data (high drop‐out rates) and potential selective reporting. The other 10 studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. A non‐significant trend in favour of sulfasalazine over placebo for inducing remission was observed, with benefit confined mainly to patients with Crohn's colitis. Forty‐five per cent (63/141) of sulfasalazine patients entered remission at 17‐18 weeks compared to 29% (43/148) of placebo patients (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.89, 2 studies). A GRADE analysis rated the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome as moderate due to sparse data (106 events). There was no difference between sulfasalazine and placebo in adverse event outcomes. Sulfasalazine was significantly less effective than corticosteroids and inferior to combination therapy with corticosteroids (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.86, 1 study, 110 patients). Forty‐three per cent (55/128) of sulfasalazine patients entered remission at 17 to 18 weeks compared to 60% (79/132) of corticosteroid patients (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.91; 2 studies, 260 patients). A GRADE analysis rated the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome as moderate due to sparse data (134 events). Sulfasalazine patients experienced significantly fewer adverse events than corticosteroid patients (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.82; 1 study, 159 patients). There was no difference between sulfasalazine and corticosteroids in serious adverse events or withdrawal due to adverse events. Olsalazine was less effective than placebo in a single trial (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.71; 91 patients). Low dose mesalamine (1 to 2 g/day) was not superior to placebo for induction of remission. Twenty‐three per cent (43/185) of low dose mesalamine patients entered remission at week 6 compared to 15% (18/117) of placebo patients (RR = 1.46, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.40; n = 302). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to risk of bias (incomplete outcome data) and sparse data (61 events). There was no difference between low dose mesalamine and placebo in the proportion of patients who had adverse events (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.96; 3 studies, 342 patients) or withdrew due to adverse events (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.95; 3 studies, 342 patients). High dose controlled‐release mesalamine (4 g/day) was not superior to placebo, inducing a clinically non significant reduction in CDAI (MD ‐19.8 points, 95% CI ‐46.2 to 6.7; 3 studies, 615 patients), and was also inferior to budesonide (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.78; 1 study, 182 patients, GRADE = low). While high dose delayed‐release mesalamine (3 to 4.5 g/day) was not superior to placebo for induction of remission (RR 2.02, 95% CI 0.75 to 5.45; 1 study, 38 patients, GRADE = very low), no significant difference in efficacy was found when compared to conventional corticosteroids (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.36; 3 studies, 178 patients, GRADE = moderate) or budesonide (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05; 1 study, 307 patients, GRADE = moderate). However, these trials were limited by risk of bias (incomplete outcome data) and sparse data (small numbers of events). There was a lack of good quality clinical trials comparing sulfasalazine with other mesalamine formulations. Adverse events that were commonly reported included headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea. 
Authors' conclusions
Sulfasalazine is only modestly effective with a trend towards benefit over placebo and is inferior to corticosteroids for the treatment of mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease. Olsalazine and low dose mesalamine (1 to 2 g/day) are not superior to placebo. High dose mesalamine (3.2 to 4 g/day) is not more effective than placebo for inducing response or remission. However, trials assessing the efficacy of high dose mesalamine (4 to 4.5 g/day) compared to budesonide yielded conflicting results and firm conclusions cannot be made. Future large randomized controlled trials are needed to provide definitive evidence on the efficacy of aminosalicylates in active Crohn's disease.","Aminosalicylates for treatment of active Crohn's disease
What is Crohn's disease?
Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestines. Although Crohn's disease is often found in the ileum (the lower part of the small intestine), it can occur in any part of the digestive tract, from the mouth to the anus. The most common symptoms of Crohn's disease are diarrhea and abdominal pain which often occurs in the lower right region of the abdomen. 
What are aminosalicylates?
Aminosalicylates are a family of medications with various formulations that deliver the active ingredient, mesalamine, to target sites. Aminosalicylates are thought to treat Crohn's disease by reducing the inflammation of the intestines caused by the disease. 
What did the researchers investigate?
The researchers investigated whether aminosalicylates produce remission or alleviate disease severity in individuals with mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease, and whether they cause any harms (side effects). The researchers searched the medical literature extensively up to June 10, 2015. 
What did the researchers find?
The researchers identified twenty studies including a total of 2367 participants. Ten studies were judged to be of moderate to high quality, while the other ten studies were judged to be of low quality. The studies compared aminosalicylates (sulfasalazine, mesalazine and mesalamine) with placebo (inactive pills or tablets), corticosteroids or budesonide (a steroid that is rapidly metabolized by the body and has less side‐effects than traditional corticosteroids). 
The researchers found that, comparing to placebo, sulfasalazine provides only a modest benefit for the treatment of mild to moderately active Crohn's disease and is inferior to corticosteroids for treatment of active Crohn's disease. Sulphasalazine differs from other aminosalicylates in that it contains a sulpha portion that has been eliminated in the other preparations. 
Mesalazine and mesalamine formulations are not effective for inducing remission in active Crohn's disease. Budesonide was compared to high dose mesalamine (4 to 4.5 g/day) but results were conflicting. One study found mesalamine to be inferior to budesonide and the other study found no difference in effectiveness between mesalamine and budesonide. 
Side effects are generally mild in nature and typically include headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea. 
In conclusion, sulfasalazine is only modestly effective for the treatment of active Crohn's disease. However, the existing data show little benefit for mesalamine.","# Plain Language Summary

## What is this study about?

Researchers reviewed 20 studies to compare different medicines used to treat mild to moderate Crohn's disease. They wanted to know if certain medications called aminosalicylates work better than a placebo (fake medicine) or other treatments.

## Who was studied?

The review included 2,367 patients from 20 different studies. All patients had mild to moderately active Crohn's disease.

## What medicines were tested?

The researchers looked at three main medicines:
- **Sulfasalazine** (an older medication)
- **Mesalamine** (a newer medication, tested at different doses)
- **Olsalazine** (another type of medication)

These were compared to placebo, corticosteroids (strong anti-inflammatory medicines), and each other.

## What were the main findings?

**Sulfasalazine:** Showed modest benefit over placebo, but was not as effective as corticosteroids. It caused fewer side effects than corticosteroids.

**Low-dose mesalamine (1-2 grams per day):** Did not work better than placebo.

**High-dose mesalamine (3-4.5 grams per day):** Did not work better than placebo.

**Olsalazine:** Actually performed worse than placebo.

## What side effects were reported?

Common side effects included headache, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, and diarrhea.

## Bottom line

These medications showed limited effectiveness for treating mild to moderate Crohn's disease. Corticosteroids remained more effective. Researchers recommend larger, better-designed studies to get clearer answers.","**Plain Language Summary:**

**Why the Study Was Done:**
This study looked at how well certain medicines, called aminosalicylates, work for people with mild to moderate Crohn's disease. Researchers wanted to find out if these medicines help patients feel better compared to not taking them or using other treatments.

**Who Participated:**
The study included 2,367 patients across 20 different trials. These patients had mild to moderate Crohn's disease.

**What Researchers Did:**
Researchers reviewed studies comparing two aminosalicylates, sulfasalazine and mesalamine, to a dummy treatment (placebo), and other common treatments like corticosteroids. They looked at how these treatments helped reduce symptoms and how safe they were.

**What They Found:**
- **Sulfasalazine:** Showed some benefit over placebo, especially for patients with Crohn's colitis. However, it was not as good as corticosteroids. About 45% of patients on sulfasalazine got better compared to 29% on placebo. It had fewer side effects than corticosteroids.
- **Olsalazine and Low Dose Mesalamine:** Did not work better than placebo.
- **High Dose Mesalamine:** Showed mixed results. It was not better than placebo but had unclear results when compared with another drug, budesonide.

**Side Effects:**
Common side effects included headaches, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, and diarrhea.

**Conclusions:**
Sulfasalazine might help a little but isn't better than corticosteroids. Other treatments like olsalazine and low-dose mesalamine didn't show clear benefits. More research is needed to understand how well these medicines really work in people with Crohn's disease.

**Safety and Next Steps:**
More large-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings and improve treatment options for Crohn's disease."
"Background
Excessive blood loss and increased blood transfusion requirements may have significant impact on the short‐term and long‐term outcomes after liver transplantation. 
Objectives
To compare the potential benefits and harms of different methods of decreasing blood loss and blood transfusion requirements during liver transplantation. 
Search methods
We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and metaRegister of Controlled Trials until September 2011. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised clinical trials that were performed to compare various methods of decreasing blood loss and blood transfusion requirements during liver transplantation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently identified the trials and extracted the data. We analysed the data with both the fixed‐effect and the random‐effects model using RevMan Analysis. For each outcome we calculated the risk ratio (RR), mean difference (MD), or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on available data analysis. We also conducted network meta‐analysis. 
Main results
We included 33 trials involving 1913 patients. The sample size in the trials varied from 8 to 209 participants. The interventions included pharmacological interventions (aprotinin, tranexamic acid, epsilon amino caproic acid, antithrombin 3, recombinant factor (rFvIIa), oestrogen, prostaglandin, epinephrine), blood substitutes (blood components rather than whole blood, hydroxy‐ethyl starch, thromboelastography), and cardiovascular interventions (low central venous pressure). All the trials were of high risk of bias. Primary outcomes were reported in at least two trials for the following comparisons: aprotinin versus control, tranexamic acid versus control, recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) versus control, and tranexamic acid versus aprotinin. There were no significant differences in the 60‐day mortality (3 trials; 6/161 (3.7%) in the aprotinin group versus 8/119 (6.7%) in the control group; RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.18 to 1.45), primary graft non‐function (2 trials; 0/128 (0.0%) in the aprotinin group versus 4/89 (4.5%) in the control group; RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.02 to 1.25), retransplantation (3 trials; 2/256 (0.8%) in the aprotinin group versus 12/178 (6.7%) in the control group; RR 0.21; 95% CI 0.02 to 1.79), or thromboembolic episodes (3 trials; 4/161 (2.5%) in the aprotinin group versus 5/119 (4.2%) in the control group; RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.84) between the aprotinin and control groups. There were no significant differences in the 60‐day mortality (3 trials; 4/83 (4.8%) in the tranexamic acid group versus 5/56 (8.9%) in the control group; RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.76), retransplantation (2 trials; 3/41 (7.3%) in the tranexamic acid group versus 3/36 (8.3%) in the control group; RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.18 to 3.48), or thromboembolic episodes (5 trials; 5/103 (4.9%) in the tranexamic acid group versus 1/76 (1.3%) in the control group; RR 2.20; 95% CI 0.38 to 12.64) between the tranexamic acid and control groups. There were no significant differences in the 60‐day mortality (3 trials; 8/195 (4.1%) in the recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) group versus 2/91 (2.2%) in the control group; RR 1.51; 95% CI 0.33 to 6.95), thromboembolic episodes (2 trials; 24/185 (13.0%) in the rFVIIa group versus 8/81 (9.9%) in the control group; RR 1.38; 95% CI 0.65 to 2.91), or serious adverse events (2 trials; 90/185 (48.6%) in the rFVIIa group versus 30/81 (37.0%) in the control group; RR 1.30; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.78) between the rFVIIa and control groups. There were no significant differences in the 60‐day mortality (2 trials; 6/91 (6.6%) in the tranexamic acid group versus 1/87 (1.1%) in the aprotinin group; RR 4.12; 95% CI 0.71 to 23.76) or thromboembolic episodes (2 trials; 4/91 (4.4%) in the tranexamic acid group versus 2/87 (2.3%) in the aprotinin group; RR 1.97; 95% CI 0.37 to 10.37) between the tranexamic acid and aprotinin groups. The remaining outcomes in the above comparisons and the remaining comparisons included only only trial under the primary outcome or the outcome was not reported at all in the trials. There were no significant differences in the mortality, primary graft non‐function, graft failure, retransplantation, thromboembolic episodes, or serious adverse events in any of these comparisons. However, the confidence intervals were wide, and it is not possible to reach any conclusion on the safety of the interventions. None of the trials reported the quality of life in patients. 
Secondary outcomes were reported in at least two trials for the following comparisons ‐ aprotinin versus control, tranexamic acid versus control, rFVIIa versus control, thromboelastography versus control, and tranexamic acid versus aprotinin. There was significantly lower allogeneic blood transfusion requirements in the aprotinin group than the control group (8 trials; 185 patients in aprotinin group and 190 patients in control group; SMD ‐0.61; 95% CI ‐0.82 to ‐0.40). There were no significant differences in the allogeneic blood transfusion requirements between the tranexamic acid and control groups (4 trials; 93 patients in tranexamic acid group and 66 patients in control group; SMD ‐0.27; 95% CI ‐0.59 to 0.06); rFVIIa and control groups (2 trials; 141 patients in rFVIIa group and 80 patients in control group; SMD ‐0.05; 95% CI ‐0.32 to 0.23); thromboelastography and control groups (2 trials; 31 patients in thromboelastography group and 31 patients in control group; SMD ‐0.73; 95% CI ‐1.69 to 0.24); or between the tranexamic acid and aprotinin groups (3 trials; 101 patients in tranexamic acid group and 97 patients in aprotinin group; SMD ‐0.09; 95% CI ‐0.36 to 0.19). The remaining outcomes in the above comparisons and the remaining comparisons included only only trial under the primary outcome or the outcome was not reported at all in the trials. There were no significant differences in the blood loss, transfusion requirements, hospital stay, or intensive care unit stay in most of the comparisons. 
Authors' conclusions
Aprotinin, recombinant factor VIIa, and thromboelastography groups may potentially reduce blood loss and transfusion requirements. However, risks of systematic errors (bias) and risks of random errors (play of chance) hamper the confidence in this conclusion. We need further well‐designed randomised trials with low risk of systematic error and low risk of random errors before these interventions can be supported or refuted.","Methods to decrease blood loss and transfusion requirements for liver transplantation
The liver is the powerhouse of the body. It acts as a store of energy and a centre of metabolic activity. Liver transplantation is the main treatment for severe liver disease resulting in destruction of the liver (which can happen suddenly or over a period of time) due to various causes including alcoholism, viral infections, and autoimmune diseases. Liver transplantation is a major surgical procedure and is associated with significant loss of blood. Various methods have been used to decrease blood loss and transfusion requirements in patients undergoing liver transplantation, with a view to improve the results of liver transplantation. We performed a detailed review of the medical literature (available until September 2011) to determine the benefits and harms of different methods of decreasing blood loss and transfusion requirements in patients undergoing liver transplantation. We sought evidence from randomised clinical trials only, as when conducted properly such studies provide the best evidence. Two authors independently identified the trials and obtained the information from the trials. 
We included 33 trials involving 1913 patients. The number of patients included in the trials varied from 8 to 209. The comparisons included various drugs that affect the blood clotting (congealing) such as aprotinin, tranexamic acid; blood substitutes (blood components rather than whole blood); use of thromboelastography (a bedside measure of blood clot formation); and lowering the pressure in the veins with an aim to decrease the blood loss from veins. We found no significant difference in the risk of death or graft loss, or in the major complication rates between the compared groups in any of the comparisons. Quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. There does not appear to be any consistency in the results between blood loss and blood transfusion requirements. Aprotinin, tranexamic acid, recombinant factor VIIa, low central venous pressure, and thromboelastography may lower blood loss and transfusion requirements. However, these findings are based on few trials with a high risk of bias (systematic overestimation of benefits) and high risk of play of chance (random error due to small number of patients). There were no differences in the hospital stay or intensive care unit stay in any of the comparisons. Nor was there any significant difference in the intensive therapy unit stay, or hospital stay between the compared groups. Again, most of the trials were of high risk of systematic errors (a potential to arrive at wrong conclusions because of the way the trial was conducted) and random errors (a potential to arrive at wrong conclusions because of play of chance). 
Aprotinin is a drug which has been withdrawn from market since there was a suspicion that it increased death after major heart operations. The results from this review do not reveal any increased mortality with aprotinin in the liver transplantation setting although one has to interpret this information with caution because of the few patients included in the trial. We are unable to advocate or refute any method of decreasing blood loss and transfusion requirements in patients undergoing liver transplantation. Further well designed trials with low risk of systematic error and low risk of random errors are necessary.","# Plain Language Summary: Blood Loss Reduction During Liver Transplants

## What is this study about?

This study looked at different methods to reduce blood loss and the need for blood transfusions during liver transplant surgery. Losing too much blood during surgery can cause serious problems for patients both right after surgery and in the long term.

## Who participated?

Researchers reviewed 33 different studies that included a total of 1,913 patients. The studies ranged in size from 8 to 209 patients each.

## What methods were tested?

The studies tested several different approaches:
- **Medications** that help blood clot (like aprotinin and tranexamic acid)
- **Blood products** used instead of whole blood
- **Special monitoring** to track blood clotting during surgery
- **Surgical techniques** to keep blood pressure lower during the operation

## What did they find?

**Main findings:**
- None of the methods clearly prevented deaths or serious complications
- **Aprotinin** (one medication) showed the most promise for reducing the amount of blood patients needed during surgery
- The other methods did not show clear benefits for reducing blood transfusions

**Important note:** The studies had quality problems, and the results were not strong enough to make definite conclusions.

## What does this mean?

The researchers concluded that while some methods *might* help reduce blood loss, better quality studies are needed before doctors can confidently recommend them. More research is necessary before we know which methods are truly safe and effective.","### Plain Language Summary

**Purpose of Study**
This study looked at ways to reduce blood loss and the need for blood transfusions during liver transplants. 

**How It Was Done**
Researchers reviewed 33 clinical trials with a total of 1,913 patients. These trials tested different methods to manage blood loss during liver transplants, including medicines and special techniques.

**Methods Tested**
1. **Medicines**: Aprotinin, tranexamic acid, and others.
2. **Blood Alternatives**: Used different blood components and substances.
3. **Techniques**: Lowering certain blood pressure levels in the body.

**Key Findings**
- **Blood Transfusions**: Aprotinin helped reduce the need for blood transfusions compared to not using any intervention.
- **Other Methods**: No major differences were found for other methods like tranexamic acid or special techniques.
- **Safety and Results**: There were no clear differences in survival within 60 days after the transplant or other health problems between any of the methods tested.

**Safety and Quality of Life**
The study couldn't confirm if any method was completely safe or improved patients' quality of life. More studies are needed.

**Conclusion**
Some methods might help reduce blood loss, but it's not certain. Future research with better study designs is needed to decide which methods are best."
"Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma, also called malignant hepatoma, is a primary malignancy of the liver. Despite regular surveillance conducted in high‐risk populations, most people with hepatocellular carcinoma are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Consequently, only a minority of people with the disease are suitable for surgical resection when diagnosed. 
Objectives
To compare the beneficial and harmful effects of transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) followed by three‐dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3‐DCRT) versus TACE alone in adults with primary hepatocellular carcinoma, considered unsuitable for surgical resection. 
Search methods
We searched The Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index – Science up to 31 May 2018. We checked reference lists for all included studies and related reviews for further relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised clinical trials comparing TACE followed by 3‐DCRT versus TACE alone in people with primary hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as suggested by Cochrane. We presented the results of the fixed‐effect model in the absence of statistical heterogeneity. Otherwise, we reported the results from the random‐effects model meta‐analysis. We assessed risk of bias of the included trials using bias risk domains and presented the review results incorporating the methodological quality of the trials using GRADE. Our main conclusions were based on the analysis up to three years' follow‐up. 
Main results
We identified eight randomised clinical trials (632 participants) that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. All eight trials were at high risk of bias, and we rated the evidence as low to very low certainty. The mean age ranged from 16 years to 78 years. The proportion of men ranged from 60% to 75% and the proportion of people with stage III primary hepatocellular carcinoma ranged from 22% to 85%. The median follow‐up duration was 12 months (2 months to 38 months). 
TACE followed by 3‐DCRT compared with TACE alone may have reduced all‐cause mortality at three years' follow‐up (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.88; 552 participants; 7 trials; low‐certainty evidence). TACE followed by 3‐DCRT compared with TACE alone may reduce the proportion of participants without tumour response (complete response plus partial response) (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.61; 632 participants; 8 trials; low‐certainty evidence). Data, from one trial on health‐related quality of life, favoured the TACE followed by 3‐DCRT group, but the provided data were ill‐defined (very low‐certainty evidence). None of the trials reported serious adverse events. The results on non‐serious adverse events were as follows: TACE followed by 3‐DCRT compared with TACE alone showed no difference in the results for proportion of participants with leukopenia (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.34; 438 participants; 5 trials; very low‐certainty evidence) and serum transaminases elevation (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.66 to 4.27; 280 participants; 4 trials; very low‐certainty evidence). However, the proportion of participants with total bilirubin elevation was larger in the TACE followed by 3‐DCRT group than in the TACE alone group (RR 2.69, 95% CI 1.34 to 5.40; 172 participants; 2 trials; very low‐certainty evidence). The rate of participants with serum alpha‐fetoprotein (AFP) without decline or normalisation was significantly lower in the TACE followed by 3‐DCRT group than in the TACE group, but these data were from one trial only (Chi² = 7.24, P = 0.007; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
TACE followed by 3‐DCRT may be associated with lower all‐cause mortality and increased tumour response, despite the increased toxicity expressed by a higher rise of total bilirubin. Our review findings should be considered with caution because of the methodological weaknesses in the included trials, resulting in low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence. Data on serious adverse events and health‐related quality of life are lacking. We are also very much uncertain in the results of the reported non‐serious adverse events. High‐quality trials are needed to assess further the role of TACE followed by 3‐DCRT for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.","Transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation followed by three‐dimensional conformal radiotherapy for primary hepatocellular carcinoma 
Background 
Hepatocellular carcinoma, also called malignant hepatoma, is a primary liver cancer. Despite regular surveillance conducted in high‐risk populations, most people with hepatocellular carcinoma are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Consequently, a minority of the people with the disease are suitable for surgical resection (removal). Since transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE; a procedure to restrict the blood supply to a tumour) was introduced as a palliative (to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life) treatment in people with unresectable liver cancer, it has become one of the most common forms of intervention. More recently, the modern radiation technology of three‐dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3‐DCRT), which shapes the radiation beams to the shape of the tumour, has been used to improve the adverse effects of conventional radiotherapy. It is predicted that the combination of TACE followed by 3‐DCRT could enhance the treatment effect for hepatocellular carcinoma. To date, little is known about the benefits and harms of the combination of TACE followed by 3‐DCRT, and current studies are still controversial for the efficacy of the combination of TACE followed by 3‐DCRT compared with TACE alone. The aim of this Cochrane systematic review was to compare the benefits and harms of TACE followed by 3‐DCRT versus TACE alone in people with primary hepatocellular carcinoma, considered to be unsuitable for surgical removal. 
Study characteristics 
The review authors searched the medical literature in order to clarify the role of the combination of TACE followed by 3‐DCRT for the treatment of primary hepatocellular carcinoma, and to compare their benefits and harms with TACE alone. We collected and analysed data from randomised clinical trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) of people with primary hepatocellular carcinoma who were able to receive TACE or 3‐DCRT. Evidence is current to May 2018. 
Key results and quality of evidence 
The review included eight trials with 632 participants. All trials were at high risk of bias. TACE followed by 3‐DCRT appeared to be superior to TACE in improving death from any cause and tumour response, despite an increased toxicity expressed by a higher rise of total bilirubin (measured by a blood test to see how well the liver is working). No trials reported serious side effects. One trial reported health‐related quality of life (a measure of a person's satisfaction with their life and health), but this was ill‐defined. The review findings were uncertain because the included trials had methodological weaknesses. More high‐quality randomised clinical trials are needed to confirm or complete the review findings.","# Plain Language Summary

## What is this study about?

This review looked at two different treatment approaches for a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma. The study compared:
- **Treatment A:** A procedure called TACE (which delivers medicine directly to the tumor through blood vessels) followed by radiation therapy
- **Treatment B:** TACE alone

The study focused on patients whose cancer could not be removed with surgery.

## Why is this important?

Most people with this type of liver cancer are diagnosed when it's already advanced. Because of this, surgery is often not an option. Doctors want to find the best treatment to help these patients live longer and feel better.

## What did researchers do?

The researchers looked at 8 previous studies that tested both treatments. These studies included 632 patients total. The patients were followed for different lengths of time, with an average of about 12 months.

## What did they find?

**Good news:**
- Patients who received TACE plus radiation therapy may have lived longer than those who received TACE alone
- The combination treatment may have worked better at shrinking or stopping the cancer from growing

**Side effects:**
- The combination treatment caused more problems with a liver chemical called bilirubin
- Other side effects like low white blood cells were similar between both groups
- No serious side effects were reported in any of the studies

## Important limitations

The researchers noted that the studies they reviewed had weaknesses, so the evidence is not very strong. They need better-quality studies to be sure about these results.","### Plain Language Summary

This clinical trial looked at two treatments for adults with liver cancer that can't be removed with surgery. The main goal was to see if combining two treatments is better than using just one.

#### What Was Studied?

Researchers compared two treatments:
1. **TACE followed by 3-DCRT**: a combination that uses medicine and radiation to target the cancer.
2. **TACE alone**: only the medicine part.

#### Who Was Involved?

- 632 adults with liver cancer that can't be cut out with surgery.
- The study included people ages 16 to 78, mostly men.

#### Key Findings

- **Survival**: The combination treatment might help people live longer after three years.
- **Cancer Response**: The combination might reduce the size or presence of tumors better.
- **Quality of Life**: One study suggested the combination might improve quality of life, but details weren't clear.

#### Safety

- Serious side effects were not reported.
- Minor side effects included changes in blood cells and liver chemicals.
- The combination treatment showed more increase in a liver-related substance.

#### Limitations

- The results aren't very certain because the studies had some design issues.
- More high-quality research is needed to confirm these findings.

So, while the combination treatment shows promise, the evidence isn't strong enough yet, and more research is necessary to know for sure."
"Background
In most pregnancies that miscarry, arrest of embryonic or fetal development occurs some time (often weeks) before the miscarriage occurs. Ultrasound examination can reveal abnormal findings during this phase by demonstrating anembryonic pregnancies or embryonic or fetal death. Treatment has traditionally been surgical but medical treatments may be effective, safe, and acceptable, as may be waiting for spontaneous miscarriage. This is an update of a review first published in 2006. 
Objectives
To assess, from clinical trials, the effectiveness and safety of different medical treatments for the termination of non‐viable pregnancies. 
Search methods
For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (24 October 2018) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials comparing medical treatment with another treatment (e.g. surgical evacuation), or placebo, or no treatment for early pregnancy failure. Quasi‐randomised studies were excluded. Cluster‐randomised trials were eligible for inclusion, as were studies reported in abstract form, if sufficient information was available to assess eligibility. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Forty‐three studies (4966 women) were included. The main interventions examined were vaginal, sublingual, oral and buccal misoprostol, mifepristone and vaginal gemeprost. These were compared with surgical management, expectant management, placebo, or different types of medical interventions were compared with each other. The review includes a wide variety of different interventions which have been analysed across 23 different comparisons. Many of the comparisons consist of single studies. We limited the grading of the quality of evidence to two main comparisons: vaginal misoprostol versus placebo and vaginal misoprostol versus surgical evacuation of the uterus. Risk of bias varied widely among the included trials. The quality of the evidence varied between the different comparisons, but was mainly found to be very‐low or low quality. 
Vaginal misoprostol versus placebo 
Vaginal misoprostol may hasten miscarriage when compared with placebo: e.g. complete miscarriage (5 trials, 305 women, risk ratio (RR) 4.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.01 to 5.94; low‐quality evidence). No trial reported on pelvic infection rate for this comparison. Vaginal misoprostol made little difference to rates of nausea (2 trials, 88 women, RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.43 to 4.40; low‐quality evidence), diarrhoea (2 trials, 88 women, RR 2.21, 95% CI 0.35 to 14.06; low‐quality evidence) or to whether women were satisfied with the acceptability of the method (1 trial, 32 women, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.64; low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether vaginal misoprostol reduces blood loss (haemoglobin difference > 10 g/L) (1 trial, 50 women, RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.12; very‐low quality) or pain (opiate use) (1 trial, 84 women, RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 101.11; very‐low quality), because the quality of the evidence for these outcomes was found to be very low. 
Vaginal misoprostol versus surgical evacuation 
Vaginal misoprostol may be less effective in accomplishing a complete miscarriage compared to surgical management (6 trials, 943 women, average RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.50; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.03, I² = 46%; low‐quality evidence) and may be associated with more nausea (1 trial, 154 women, RR 21.85, 95% CI 1.31 to 364.37; low‐quality evidence) and diarrhoea (1 trial, 154 women, RR 40.85, 95% CI 2.52 to 662.57; low‐quality evidence). There may be little or no difference between vaginal misoprostol and surgical evacuation for pelvic infection (1 trial, 618 women, RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.37; low‐quality evidence), blood loss (post‐treatment haematocrit (%) (1 trial, 50 women, mean difference (MD) 1.40%, 95% CI ‐3.51 to 0.71; low‐quality evidence), pain relief (1 trial, 154 women, RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.46; low‐quality evidence) or women's satisfaction/acceptability of method (1 trial, 45 women, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.11; low‐quality evidence). 
Other comparisons 
Based on findings from a single trial, vaginal misoprostol was more effective at accomplishing complete miscarriage than expectant management (614 women, RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.45). There was little difference between vaginal misoprostol and sublingual misoprostol (5 trials, 513 women, average RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.16; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.10, I² = 871%; or between oral and vaginal misoprostol in terms of complete miscarriage at less than 13 weeks (4 trials, 418 women), average RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.03; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.13, I² = 90%). However, there was less abdominal pain with vaginal misoprostol in comparison to sublingual (3 trials, 392 women, RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.74). A single study (46 women) found mifepristone to be more effective than placebo: miscarriage complete by day five after treatment (46 women, RR 9.50, 95% CI 2.49 to 36.19). However the quality of this evidence is very low: there is a very serious risk of bias with signs of incomplete data and no proper intention‐to‐treat analysis in the included study; and serious imprecision with wide confidence intervals. Mifepristone did not appear to further hasten miscarriage when added to a misoprostol regimen (3 trials, 447 women, RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.47). 
Authors' conclusions
Available evidence from randomised trials suggests that medical treatment with vaginal misoprostol may be an acceptable alternative to surgical evacuation or expectant management. In general, side effects of medical treatment were minor, consisting mainly of nausea and diarrhoea. There were no major differences in effectiveness between different routes of administration. Treatment satisfaction was addressed in only a few studies, in which the majority of women were satisfied with the received intervention. Since the quality of evidence is low or very low for several comparisons, mainly because they included only one or two (small) trials; further research is necessary to assess the effectiveness, safety and side effects, optimal route of administration and dose of different medical treatments for early fetal death.","Medical treatment for early fetal death (less than 24 weeks)
What is the issue? 
A miscarriage is the spontaneous death and/or expulsion of an embryo or fetus from the uterus before it is able to survive on its own. This natural death of an embryo or fetus ('non‐viable pregnancy' or 'intrauterine fetal death', depending on the duration of pregnancy) can be identified by ultrasound before symptoms like blood loss and abdominal pain occur. Sometimes an embryo may not have even developed ('empty sac'). In the past, treatment for a deceived embryo/fetus, has usually been by dilatation and curettage (D&C) surgery, but drugs have now been developed to replace the need for surgery which may be helpful for the expulsion to happen. Misoprostol and gemeprost are synthetic prostaglandin E analogues that can stimulate expulsion of the embryo/fetus from the uterus. Mifepristone blocks the activity of progesterone, a hormone that supports pregnancy. These and similar drugs may be useful in bringing on expulsion in women with a non‐viable pregnancy and can be used before 24 weeks' gestation. 
Waiting for spontaneous expulsion is also possible. Women who retain the dead embryo/fetus can experience severe blood loss or develop an infection of the womb. These are rare complications. Gastro‐intestinal side effects such as nausea and diarrhoea, cramping or abdominal pain and fever have been reported with misoprostol. 
Why is this important? 
Surgical treatment has the disadvantage of requiring anaesthesia. It carries risks of damage to the uterus or cervix and possible development of fibrous tissue in the inner lining of the uterus. These can be avoided if the non‐viable pregnancy is treated with medication, or if the woman is able to wait for a spontaneous expulsion. 
We set out to determine if medical treatment is as good as, or better than, surgical treatment or expectant management (waiting for the expulsion to happen). Furthermore, we compared different doses and administration routes in order to detect which regimen most often induces a complete miscarriage with the fewest side effects. 
What evidence did we find? 
For this updated review, 43 randomised clinical trials involving 4966 women with non‐viable pregnancies at less than 24 weeks' gestation were included. The main interventions examined were vaginal, sublingual, oral and buccal misoprostol, mifepristone and vaginal gemeprost. These were compared with surgical management, expectant management, placebo, or different types of medical interventions were compared with each other. Fourteen comparisons had only one trial. The studies varied in risk of bias. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low or low for most comparisons. 
Vaginal misoprostol may hasten miscarriage when compared with placebo but made little difference to rates of nausea, diarrhoea or to whether women were satisfied with the acceptability of the method. It is uncertain whether vaginal misoprostol when compared to placebo reduces blood loss or pain because the quality of the evidence for these outcomes was found to be very low. 
Vaginal misoprostol was less effective in accomplishing a complete miscarriage compared to surgical management and may be associated with more nausea and diarrhoea. Vaginal misoprostol made little difference to pelvic infection, blood loss, pain or women's satisfaction/acceptability of method when compared to surgical management. 
There was little difference between different routes of giving misoprostol when trials compared the vaginal route with placing it under the tongue or between oral and vaginal misoprostol. Single studies found mifepristone to be more effective than placebo and vaginal misoprostol to be more effective than expectant management. However the quality of this evidence was found to be very low and so we are not convinced of these findings. Mifepristone did not appear to provide any additional benefit when added to misoprostol. 
What does this mean? 
Using misoprostol as an alternative to surgical treatment may decrease the need for surgery for women with an early fetal death. The use of misoprostol can have some side effects such as nausea and diarrhoea, but risks of severe blood loss or pelvic infection were not higher compared to surgical treatment or expectant management. Further research is needed on drug doses, routes of administration and potential adverse effects, including future fertility, and also on women's views of drug treatment, surgery and waiting for spontaneous miscarriage.","# Plain Language Summary: Medical Treatments for Early Pregnancy Loss

## What is this study about?

This review looked at different ways to treat early pregnancy loss (when a pregnancy stops developing). Researchers compared medicines, surgery, and waiting for the body to naturally miscarry.

## Who was studied?

The review included 43 studies with 4,966 women who had early pregnancy loss.

## What treatments were tested?

The main treatments studied were:
- **Medicines** (misoprostol, mifepristone, and gemeprost) given in different ways (vaginal, under the tongue, by mouth, or inside the cheek)
- **Surgery** to remove pregnancy tissue
- **Waiting** for natural miscarriage
- **Placebo** (fake medicine)

## What did researchers find?

**Vaginal misoprostol vs. placebo:**
- The medicine helped pregnancies miscarry faster than fake medicine
- It caused nausea and diarrhea in some women, but not much more than placebo
- Most women were satisfied with this option

**Vaginal misoprostol vs. surgery:**
- Surgery was more likely to completely end the pregnancy
- The medicine caused more nausea and diarrhea than surgery
- Both methods were similar for infection risk, blood loss, pain, and satisfaction

**Other findings:**
- The medicine worked better than waiting for natural miscarriage
- Different ways of taking the medicine worked similarly
- Side effects were usually mild (mainly nausea and diarrhea)

## Bottom line

Medicine appears to be a safe and acceptable choice for treating early pregnancy loss. However, researchers need more studies to find the best medicine, dose, and method of delivery.","**Summary of the Clinical Trial**

**Purpose:**  
This study looks at how safe and effective different medicines are for managing early pregnancy loss.

**Who Participated:**  
The study included 4,966 women across 43 trials.

**Treatment Options Tested:**  
- Medicines like misoprostol (given in different ways such as vaginally or orally) and mifepristone.
- Compared these medicines to surgery, doing nothing, or placebos.

**Key Findings:**  
1. **Vaginal Misoprostol vs. Placebo:**  
   - May help complete a miscarriage faster.  
   - Similar rates of side effects like nausea and diarrhea.

2. **Vaginal Misoprostol vs. Surgery:**  
   - Surgery was more effective for completing miscarriage.  
   - Misoprostol had more nausea and diarrhea.

3. **Other Comparisons:**  
   - Misoprostol was better than waiting for miscarriage to happen naturally.  
   - No big differences when comparing different ways of taking misoprostol.  
   - Adding mifepristone to misoprostol didn’t speed up miscarriage.

**Safety and Side Effects:**  
- Most side effects were mild, like nausea and diarrhea.  
- More research is needed to understand the best way to use these medicines and their safety.

**Conclusion:**  
Vaginal misoprostol could be a good option for managing early pregnancy loss, but more studies are needed for stronger evidence. Most women in the studies were satisfied with their treatment."
"Background
End‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a chronic, debilitative and progressive illness that may need interventions such as dialysis, transplantation, dietary and fluid restrictions. Most patients with ESKD will require renal replacement therapy, such as kidney transplantation or maintenance dialysis. Advance care planning traditionally encompass instructions via living wills, and concern patient preferences about interventions such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation and feeding tubes, or circumstances around assigning surrogate decision makers. Most people undergoing haemodialysis are not aware of advance care planning and few patients formalise their wishes as advance directives and of those who do, many do not discuss their decisions with a physician. Advance care planning involves planning for future healthcare decisions and preferences of the patient in advance while comprehension is intact. It is an essential part of good palliative care that likely improves the lives and deaths of haemodialysis patients. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to determine whether advance care planning in haemodialysis patients, compared with no or less structured forms of advance care planning, can result in fewer hospital admissions or less use of treatments with life‐prolonging or curative intent, and if patient's wishes were followed at end‐of‐life. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 27 June 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. We also searched the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Social Work Abstracts (OvidSP). 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at advance care planning versus no form of advance care planning in haemodialysis patients was considered for inclusion without language restriction. 
Data collection and analysis
Data extraction was carried out independently by two authors using standard data extraction forms. Studies reported in non‐English language journals were translated before assessment. Where more than one publication of one study exists, reports were grouped together and the publication with the most complete data was used in the analyses. Where relevant outcomes are only published in earlier versions these data were used. Any discrepancies between published versions were highlighted. Non‐randomised controlled studies were excluded. 
Main results
We included two studies (three reports) that involved 337 participants which investigated advance care planning for people with ESKD. Neither of the included studies reported outcomes relevant to this review. Study quality was assessed as suboptimal. 
Authors' conclusions
We found sparse data that were assessed at suboptimal quality and therefore we were unable to formulate conclusions about whether advance care planning can influence numbers of hospital admissions and treatment required by people with ESKD, or if patients' advance care directives were followed at end‐of‐life. Further well designed and adequately powered RCTs are needed to better inform patient and clinical decision‐making about advance care planning and advance directives among people with ESKD who are undergoing dialysis.","Advance care planning for haemodialysis patients
Background 
People with chronic kidney disease and end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) have irreversible kidney damage and require renal replacement therapy. In developed countries, haemodialysis has become the most common treatment for people with ESKD. Despite its life‐saving potential, haemodialysis can be a significant physical and psychological burden to patients. Advance care planning is the process of planning for a person’s future health and personal care decisions in terms of level of healthcare and quality of life the person would want, should for any reason, the person becomes unable to participate in decision‐making. Advance care goals can change over time and advance care planning assists in addressing these changes and readdress care goals over time. This helps to ensure that individual choices are respected in future medical treatment in an event where the person cannot communicate or make decisions. 
We wanted to find out if advance care planning can improve health outcomes among people with ESKD in terms of use of resuscitation measures such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and withdrawal from dialysis. Additionally, we wanted to find out whether patient wishes were followed in the end of life period. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the literature up to June 2016 and found two studies (three reports) that involved 337 patients which investigated use of patient‐centred advanced care planning (PC‐ACP) and peer mentoring interventions. 
Key results 
Neither study addressed our questions concerning use of life‐prolonging treatments such as resuscitation, death in hospital or withdrawal from dialysis. It remains uncertain if advance care planning can improve health outcomes among ESKD patients. More research is required to better inform use of PC‐ACP for people receiving haemodialysis treatment.","# Plain Language Summary: Advance Care Planning for Dialysis Patients

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether talking with doctors ahead of time about future medical care helps dialysis patients make better decisions about their health.

## Why does this matter?

People with end-stage kidney disease need dialysis or a kidney transplant to stay alive. Many of these patients don't plan ahead for what medical treatments they want or don't want if they become very sick. Doctors think that planning ahead—while patients are healthy enough to think clearly—could help patients get the care they actually want.

## What did researchers want to find out?

Researchers wanted to know if patients who did advance care planning (talking with doctors about their wishes) had:
- Fewer hospital visits
- Fewer life-prolonging treatments they didn't want
- Their wishes actually followed when they got very sick

## What did they find?

The researchers looked for studies comparing patients who did advance care planning with those who didn't. They found only 2 studies with 337 total patients. Unfortunately, **neither study reported the information needed to answer the main questions**. The studies also had quality problems.

## What does this mean?

We don't have enough good evidence yet to say whether advance care planning really helps dialysis patients. **More research is needed** to give doctors and patients reliable information about whether planning ahead actually makes a difference.","### Plain Language Summary

**Background**

People with very serious kidney problems often need special treatments like dialysis or a kidney transplant. They might also have to follow strict diets and limit fluids. Advance care planning is a way for patients to make decisions about their future healthcare. This includes what treatments they want or don’t want, like life-saving procedures, and who can make decisions for them if they can’t. Many people on dialysis are not aware of or don’t discuss these plans with their doctors, but it’s important for their care.

**Objective**

This study wanted to find out if making advance care plans helps dialysis patients have fewer hospital visits, use fewer life-prolonging treatments, or have their healthcare wishes followed at the end of their life.

**Methods**

The researchers looked for studies that compared advance care planning with no planning for patients on dialysis. They searched medical databases up until June 27, 2016, to find relevant studies.

**Study Criteria**

They included studies where patients were randomly chosen to either do advance care planning or not. Studies had to be in any language and the researchers focused only on certain types of scientific studies called randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

**Data Collection**

Two researchers reviewed the data separately to make sure it was accurate. They used the most complete information from each study and included non-English studies after translation.

**Main Findings**

The researchers found two studies with 337 participants that looked at advance care planning. However, these studies didn’t provide useful information for the review. The quality of the information wasn’t very good.

**Conclusion**

There wasn’t enough good-quality information to decide if advance care planning makes a difference for dialysis patients. More detailed and better-designed studies are needed to understand its benefits for people with serious kidney problems."
"Background
A posterior crossbite occurs when the top back teeth bite inside the bottom back teeth. The prevalence of posterior crossbite is around 4% and 17% of children and adolescents in Europe and America, respectively. Several treatments have been recommended to correct this problem, which is related to such dental issues as tooth attrition, abnormal development of the jaws, joint problems, and imbalanced facial appearance. Treatments involve expanding the upper jaw with an orthodontic appliance, which can be fixed (e.g. quad‐helix) or removable (e.g. expansion plate). This is the third update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different orthodontic treatments for posterior crossbites.
Search methods
Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 8 April 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of orthodontic treatment for posterior crossbites in children and adults. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors, independently and in duplicate, screened the results of the electronic searches, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. A third review author participated to resolve disagreements. We used risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to summarise dichotomous data (event), unless there were zero values in trial arms, in which case we used odds ratios (ORs). We used mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs to summarise continuous data. We performed meta‐analyses using fixed‐effect models. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for the main outcomes. 
Main results
We included 31 studies that randomised approximately 1410 participants. Eight studies were at low risk of bias, 15 were at high risk of bias, and eight were unclear. 
Intervention versus observation 
For children (age 7 to 11 years), quad‐helix was beneficial for posterior crossbite correction compared to observation (OR 50.59, 95% CI 26.77 to 95.60; 3 studies, 149 participants; high‐certainty evidence) and resulted in higher final inter‐molar distances (MD 4.71 mm, 95% CI 4.31 to 5.10; 3 studies, 146 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
For children, expansion plates were also beneficial for posterior crossbite correction compared to observation (OR 25.26, 95% CI 13.08 to 48.77; 3 studies, 148 participants; high‐certainty evidence) and resulted in higher final inter‐molar distances (MD 3.30 mm, 95% CI 2.88 to 3.73; 3 studies, 145 participants, 3 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). In addition, expansion plates resulted in higher inter‐canine distances (MD 2.59 mm, 95% CI 2.18 to 3.01; 3 studies, 145 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
The use of Hyrax is probably effective for correcting posterior crossbite compared to observation (OR 48.02, 95% CI 21.58 to 106.87; 93 participants, 3 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). Two of the studies focused on adolescents (age 12 to 16 years) and found that Hyrax increased the inter‐molar distance compared with observation (MD 5.80, 95% CI 5.15 to 6.45; 2 studies, 72 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Intervention A versus intervention B 
When comparing quad‐helix with expansion plates in children, quad‐helix was more effective for posterior crossbite correction (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.46; 3 studies, 151 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), final inter‐molar distance (MD 1.48 mm, 95% CI 0.91 mm to 2.04 mm; 3 studies, 151 participants; high‐certainty evidence), inter‐canine distance (0.59 mm higher (95% CI 0.09 mm  to 1.08 mm; 3 studies, 151 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and length of treatment (MD −3.15 months, 95% CI −4.04 to −2.25; 3 studies, 148 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between Hyrax and Haas for posterior crossbite correction (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.18; 3 studies, 83 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) or inter‐molar distance (MD −0.15 mm, 95% CI −0.86 mm to 0.56 mm; 2 studies of adolescents, 46 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between Hyrax and tooth‐bone‐borne expansion for crossbite correction (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.12; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 120 participants; low‐certainty evidence) or inter‐molar distance (MD −0.66 mm, 95% CI −1.36 mm to 0.04 mm; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 65 participants; low‐certainty evidence).  
There was no evidence of a difference between Hyrax with bone‐borne expansion for posterior crossbite correction (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07; I² = 0%; 2 studies of adolescents, 81 participants; low‐certainty evidence) or inter‐molar distance (MD −0.14 mm, 95% CI −0.85 mm to 0.57 mm; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 81 participants; low‐certainty evidence).  
Authors' conclusions
For children in the early mixed dentition stage (age 7 to 11 years old), quad‐helix and expansion plates are more beneficial than no treatment for correcting posterior crossbites. Expansion plates also increase the inter‐canine distance. Quad‐helix is more effective than expansion plates for correcting posterior crossbite and increasing inter‐molar distance. Treatment duration is shorter with quad‐helix than expansion plates. 
For adolescents in permanent dentition (age 12 to 16 years old), Hyrax and Haas are similar for posterior crossbite correction and increasing the inter‐molar distance. 
The remaining evidence was insufficient to draw any robust conclusions for the efficacy of posterior crossbite correction.","Are braces effective for treating crossbite (top back teeth biting down inside the bottom back teeth)? 
Key messages 
Orthodontic treatment with quad‐helix (fixed) or expansion plates (removeable) is effective for correcting posterior crossbite correction in children. Quad‐helix is probably even more effective than expansion plates. For adolescents, there is probably no difference between Hyrax and Haas for posterior crossbite correction. 
What is the problem? 
Posterior crossbite occurs when the top teeth or jaw are narrower than the bottom teeth. It can happen on one side or both sides of the dental arches. This condition may increase the likelihood of dental problems (e.g. tooth wear), abnormal development of the jaws, joint problems, and unbalanced facial appearance. Posterior crossbites affect around 4% and 17% of children and adolescents in Europe and America.  
Different treatment approaches have been proposed, resulting in many different braces being produced. The basic treatment to correct crossbite correction treatment involves using an orthodontic device  on the palate (roof of the mouth) to expand the upper jaw by exerting pressure on both sides of the jaw. The devices can be fixed (e.g. quad‐helix, Haas, Hyrax expander) or removable (e.g. expansion plate). Fixed appliances are bonded to the teeth, while removeable devices can be taken out of the mouth by patients. 
What did we want to know? 
We wanted to know the effects of different braces for posterior crossbite correction. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed the effectiveness of braces used to correct posterior crossbites. 
What did we find? 
We found 31 studies with 1410 children and adolescents who were randomly assigned to a treatment or no treatment group. Thirteen studies included children (7 to 11 years old), 12 included adolescents (12 to 16 years old), and six included both. Eight studies were conducted in Turkey, four in Brazil, four in Sweden, three in the USA, three in  Italy, two in Canada, and one each in Germany, UK, Switzerland, Iran, Spain, India, and Australia. Twenty‐seven studies were carried out in universities and clinical centres, one study in private practice, and three did not state the location. 
What were the main results? 
For children, expansion of the upper arch with fixed or removable braces can correct posterior crossbites.  
When testing fixed and removable braces against each other, the studies found that quad‐helix (fixed appliance) was more successful than expansion plate (removable appliance) and that treatment with quad‐helix took less time.  
For other comparisons between different types of treatments, there was no evidence to show that one worked better than another, but we had moderate to low certainty in the results, so future research may change them. 
How reliable are these results? 
Our confidence in the results is high to moderate for the main results. For the other comparisons, our confidence in the results is low. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
This review is an update. The evidence is current to April 2021.","# Plain Language Summary: Treatments for Posterior Crossbites

## What is a posterior crossbite?

A posterior crossbite is when the top back teeth bite inside the bottom back teeth instead of outside. This happens in about 4 to 17 out of every 100 children and teenagers. It can cause problems like worn-down teeth, jaw growth issues, and an unbalanced face shape.

## What was this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out which treatments work best to fix posterior crossbites. They looked at 31 different studies involving about 1,410 people of different ages.

## What treatments were tested?

The studies tested several types of devices that gently push the upper jaw wider to fix the bite:

- **Quad-helix**: A fixed wire device attached to teeth
- **Expansion plates**: A removable device that fits in the mouth
- **Hyrax**: A fixed device that expands with a special key
- **Haas**: A similar fixed device to Hyrax
- **Bone-borne expansion**: An advanced device anchored to bone

## Main findings

**For younger children (ages 7–11):**
- Quad-helix and expansion plates both worked very well compared to doing nothing
- Quad-helix worked better than expansion plates
- Quad-helix treatment took about 3 months less time than expansion plates

**For teenagers (ages 12–16):**
- Hyrax and Haas worked about the same for fixing the bite

## Safety and side effects

The studies did not report serious safety problems, but the review did not focus on side effects.

## Bottom line

For younger children, quad-helix is the most effective treatment. Expansion plates also work well if quad-helix isn't an option. For teenagers, Hyrax and Haas are equally effective choices.","### Plain Language Summary

**What is this study about?**

This study looks at different ways to fix a dental problem called posterior crossbite. This happens when the top back teeth bite inside the bottom back teeth. It often affects kids and teens in Europe and America.

**Why is it important?**

If not fixed, a posterior crossbite can cause issues like worn-down teeth and jaw problems.

**What did the study do?**

Researchers wanted to find out which treatments work best for fixing posterior crossbite. They reviewed 31 studies with about 1,410 participants, which included kids and teens. 

**What treatments were tested?**

1. **Quad-Helix:** A fixed device to expand the upper jaw.
2. **Expansion Plates:** A removable device to expand the upper jaw.
3. **Hyrax and Haas:** Other methods to expand the upper jaw.

**What did they find out?**

- For children aged 7 to 11:
  - **Quad-Helix**: Works well to correct crossbites and makes the jaw wider. It corrects faster than expansion plates.
  - **Expansion Plates**: Also help with crossbites and make both jaw and canine areas wider.
  
- For teens aged 12 to 16:
  - **Hyrax and Haas**: Both work similarly well to correct crossbites and widen the jaw.

**Safety and certainty of the results**

The study rated the evidence as moderate to high certainty, meaning they trust the results for quad-helix and expansion plates for children, and for Hyrax and Haas for teens.

**Conclusion**

Quad-helix and expansion plates help fix crossbites in kids. Quad-helix works a bit better and faster. For teens, both Hyrax and Haas are equally good options."
"Background
Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is a long term opiod replacement therapy, effective in the management of opiod dependence. Even if MMT at high dosage is recommended for reducing illicit opioid use and promoting longer retention in treatment, at present day ""the organisation and regulation of the methadone maintenance treatment varies widely"". 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy of different dosages of MMT in modifying health and social outcomes and in promoting patients' familiar, occupational and relational functioning. 
Search methods
We searched:  ‐ MEDLINE (OVID 1966‐2001)  ‐ EMBASE (1988‐2001)  ‐ ERIC (1988‐2001)  ‐ Psychinfo (1947‐2001)  ‐ Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) (1947‐2001)  ‐ Register of the Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Group (CDAG) (1947‐2001)  The CDAG search strategy was applied together with a specific MESH strategy. 
Further studies were searched through:  · letters to the authors  · check of references. 
Selection criteria
Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT) and Controlled Prospective Studies (CPS) evaluating methadone maintenance at different dosages in the management of opioid dependence. Non‐randomised trials were included when proper adjustment for confounding factors was performed at the analysis stage. 
Data collection and analysis
Data Extraction was performed separately by two reviewers. Discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer. Quality assessments of the methodology of studies were carried out using CDAG checklist. 
Main results
22 studies were excluded. 21 studies were included: 11 were RCTs (2279 participants) and 10 were CPSs (3715 participants). 
Outcomes: Retention rate ‐ RCTs: High versus low doses at shorter follow‐ups: RR=1.36 [1.13,1.63], and at longer ones: RR=1.62 [0.95,2.77].  Opioid use (self reported), times/w ‐ RCTs: high versus low doses WMD= ‐2.00 [‐4.77,0.77] high vs middle doses WMD= ‐1.89[‐3.43, ‐0.35]  Opioid abstinence, (urine based) at >3‐4 w ‐ RCTs: high versus low ones: RR=1.59 [1.16,2.18] high vs middle doses RR=1.51[0.63,3.61]  Cocaine abstinence (urine based) at >3‐4 w ‐ RCTs: high versus low doses RR=1.81 [1.15,2.85]  Overdose mortality ‐ CPSs: high dose versus low dose at 6 years follow up: RR=0.29 [0.02‐5.34] high dose vs middle dose at 6 years follow up: RR=0.38 [0.02‐9.34] middle dose vs low dose at 6 years follow up: RR=0.57 [0.06‐5.06] 
Authors' conclusions
Methadone dosages ranging from 60 to 100 mg/day are more effective than lower dosages in retaining patients and in reducing use of heroin and cocaine during treatment. To find the optimal dose is a clinical ability, but clinician must consider these conclusions in treatment strategies.","Methadone maintenance at different dosages for opioid dependence
People who are addicted to opioids have high risks of receiving an overdose of opioid, HIV, hepatitis B and C infections and criminal activity. This has led to a harm reduction treatment approach to drug addiction. Treatment is aimed at a reduction in these risks and relapses to opioid and polysubstance use and promoting psychosocial adjustment. Methadone maintenance treatment is a long‐term opioid replacement therapy that is used to manage opioid dependence, reduce illicit opioid use and promote retention in treatment. Taken by mouth and active over 24 to 36 hours, it is an opioid drug that removes the euphoric effects of heroin and reduces withdrawal symptoms as well as being compatible with normal activities at work or school. The review authors identified 21 controlled trials involving a total of 5994 opioid users. In 11 of these trials, all from the USA, 2279 participants were randomised to methadone treatment at different doses or another treatment (buprenorphine or levomethadyl). Treatment was for between seven and 53 weeks. A further 10 controlled trials did not randomly assign the total of 3715 participants to a treatment. These were from various diverse countries and followed opioid users for one to 10 years. Higher doses of methadone (60 to 100 mg/day) were more effective than lower doses (1 to 39 mg/day) in retaining opioid users in therapy and in reducing illicit use of heroin and cocaine during treatment. Side effects of methadone appeared to be similar at the different doses, in one trial only.  The organisation and regulation of methadone maintenance treatment varies widely and some countries have explicit guidelines for programme operation. Methadone maintenance treatment involves the prescription of a drug which itself causes dependence. This means that treatment is not naturally aimed at the total recovery of the individual.","# Plain Language Summary: Methadone Treatment at Different Doses

## What is this study about?

This review looked at research comparing different amounts of methadone given to people. Methadone is a long-term medicine used to help people manage opioid dependence. The researchers wanted to know if higher doses work better than lower doses.

## Who was studied?

The review included 21 studies with a total of about 5,994 people. Some studies were randomized (meaning people were randomly assigned to groups), and others were not randomized but still carefully designed.

## What did researchers test?

Researchers compared:
- **High doses** of methadone (around 60–100 mg per day)
- **Medium doses** of methadone
- **Low doses** of methadone

## What were the main findings?

**People staying in treatment:** Higher doses helped more people stay in treatment, especially over longer periods.

**Reducing drug use:** Higher doses were better at reducing how often people used heroin and cocaine during treatment. This was measured both by what people reported and by urine tests.

**Deaths from overdose:** The study found very few overdose deaths across all dose groups, so it was hard to compare.

## What do the results mean?

Methadone doses between 60–100 mg per day worked better than lower doses at helping people stay in treatment and use fewer drugs. However, doctors still need to decide the right dose for each person based on their individual needs.","### Study on Methadone Treatment for People with Opioid Challenges

**Purpose of the Study:**
This study looks at how different doses of methadone can help people stay in treatment and improve their health and social lives. Methadone is a medicine used to help people with opioid issues.

**What the Researchers Did:**
Researchers searched a lot of medical and psychology databases for studies done between 1947 and 2001. They included 21 studies involving thousands of participants to compare different methadone doses.

**Who Took Part:**
The studies included over 5,994 participants who were dealing with opioid challenges.

**What They Found:**
- **Staying in Treatment:** People taking higher doses of methadone (60-100 mg/day) stayed in treatment longer than those on lower doses.
- **Reducing Drug Use:** Those on higher doses used heroin and cocaine less often compared to those on lower doses.
- **Safety:** Over six years, the chance of overdose was lower for people on higher doses.

**What This Means:**
Higher doses of methadone seem to work better than lower ones to keep people in treatment and help them use fewer drugs. Doctors should consider these findings when deciding on methadone doses for their patients."
"Background
Ventilator‐associated pneumonia (VAP) is associated with increased mortality, prolonged length of hospital stay and increased healthcare costs in critically ill patients. Guidelines recommend a semi‐recumbent position (30º to 45º) for preventing VAP among patients requiring mechanical ventilation. However, due to methodological limitations in existing systematic reviews, uncertainty remains regarding the benefits and harms of the semi‐recumbent position for preventing VAP. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of semi‐recumbent positioning versus supine positioning to prevent ventilator‐associated pneumonia (VAP) in adults requiring mechanical ventilation. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 10), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1946 to October 2015), EMBASE (2010 to October 2015), CINAHL (1981 to October 2015) and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) (1978 to October 2015). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing semi‐recumbent versus supine positioning (0º to 10º), or RCTs comparing alternative degrees of positioning in mechanically ventilated patients. Our outcomes included clinically suspected VAP, microbiologically confirmed VAP, intensive care unit (ICU) mortality, hospital mortality, length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, duration of ventilation, antibiotic use and any adverse events. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently and in duplicate screened titles, abstracts and full texts, assessed risk of bias and extracted data using standardised forms. We calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for continuous data and the risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI for binary data. We performed meta‐analysis using the random‐effects model. We used the grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) approach to grade the quality of evidence. 
Main results
We included 10 trials involving 878 participants, among which 28 participants in two trials did not provide complete data due to loss to follow‐up. We judged all trials to be at high risk of bias. 
Semi‐recumbent position (30º to 60º) versus supine position (0° to 10°) 
A semi‐recumbent position (30º to 60º) significantly reduced the risk of clinically suspected VAP compared to a 0º to 10º supine position (eight trials, 759 participants, 14.3% versus 40.2%, RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.50; risk difference (RD) 25.7%; 95% CI 20.1% to 30.1%; GRADE: moderate quality evidence). 
There was no significant difference between the two positions in the following outcomes: microbiologically confirmed VAP (three trials, 419 participants, 12.6% versus 31.6%, RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.11 to 1.77; GRADE: very low quality evidence), ICU mortality (two trials, 307 participants, 29.8% versus 34.3%, RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.27; GRADE: low quality evidence), hospital mortality (three trials, 346 participants, 23.8% versus 27.6%, RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.20; GRADE: low quality evidence), length of ICU stay (three trials, 346 participants, MD ‐1.64 days; 95% CI ‐4.41 to 1.14 days; GRADE moderate quality evidence), length of hospital stay (two trials, 260 participants, MD ‐9.47 days; 95% CI ‐34.21 to 15.27 days; GRADE: very low quality evidence), duration of ventilation (four trials, 458 participants, MD ‐3.35 days; 95% CI ‐7.80 to 1.09 days), antibiotic use (three trials, 284 participants, 84.8% versus 84.2%, RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.03) and pressure ulcers (one trial, 221 participants, 28% versus 30%, RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.38; GRADE: low quality evidence). No other adverse events were reported. 
Semi‐recumbent position (45°) versus 25° to 30° 
We found no statistically significant differences in the following prespecified outcomes: clinically suspected VAP (two trials, 91 participants, RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.35 to 1.56; GRADE: very low quality evidence), microbiologically confirmed VAP (one trial, 30 participants, RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.20 to 1.84: GRADE: very low quality evidence), ICU mortality (one trial, 30 participants, RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.15 to 2.13; GRADE: very low quality evidence), hospital mortality (two trials, 91 participants, RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.38 to 2.65; GRADE: very low quality evidence), length of ICU stay (one trial, 30 participants, MD 1.6 days; 95% CI ‐0.88 to 4.08 days; GRADE: very low quality evidence) and antibiotic use (two trials, 91 participants, RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.47). No adverse events were reported. 
Authors' conclusions
A semi‐recumbent position (≧ 30º) may reduce clinically suspected VAP compared to a 0° to 10° supine position. However, the evidence is seriously limited with a high risk of bias. No adequate evidence is available to draw any definitive conclusion on other outcomes and the comparison of alternative semi‐recumbent positions. Adverse events, particularly venous thromboembolism, were under‐reported.","Head bed elevation versus flat bed for preventing ventilator‐associated pneumonia (VAP) in adults requiring mechanical ventilation 
Background 
Adults who are critically ill often need a machine to help maintain their breathing. One side effect of these machines is an increased risk of pneumonia. This is known as ventilator‐associated pneumonia (VAP). It is a leading cause of death in critically ill patients and can also increase the length of hospital stay and healthcare costs. The angle at which ventilated patients lie might play an important role in preventing the infection of their lungs. 
Review questions 
Head bed elevation by tilting the angle of the hospital bed might prevent the source of infection from getting into the lung. We assessed the benefit and harm of semi‐recumbent positioning for the prevention of VAP in critically ill adult patients requiring mechanical ventilation. We also investigated the best angle of head bed elevation in a semi‐recumbent position. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 10 studies involving 878 participants. Twenty‐eight participants were lost to follow‐up. The evidence is current up to 27 October 2015. All participants were recruited from intensive care units (ICUs) and received mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
Moderate quality evidence from eight studies involving 759 participants demonstrated that a semi‐recumbent (30º to 60º) position reduced clinically suspected VAP by 25.7% when compared to a 0° to 10° supine position. Based on this result, we would expect that out of 1000 critically ill adult patients who are nursed in the semi‐recumbent position (30º to 60º) for more than 48 hours, 145 patients would experience clinically suspected VAP compared to 402 patients nursed in the 0° to 10° supine position. There was no significant difference between the two positions in reducing microbiologically confirmed VAP (very low quality evidence), mortality (low quality evidence), length of ICU stay (moderate quality evidence), hospital stay (very low quality evidence), duration of ventilation or use of antibiotics. The main limitations of the evidence were the small numbers of participants contributing data to the analyses and that for some studies researchers would have known which treatment group participants were from (a risk of bias). 
Only two studies with 91 participants compared different degrees of bed head angle (45° versus 25° to 30° semi‐recumbent position). Very low quality evidence showed no statistically significant differences in the effects of VAP (clinically suspected and microbiologically confirmed), mortality (ICU and hospital), length of ICU stay or use of antibiotics. Only one study reported the adverse event of pressure ulcers and did not find a difference between the 45° semi‐recumbent and 10° supine positions. No other adverse events, such as thromboembolism, or side effects on heart rate or blood pressure were reported. 
The balance of the benefit and harm of semi‐recumbent positioning still remains uncertain due to the limited numbers of studies and the low quality of the existing evidence. More high quality evidence is required on the effects of the semi‐recumbent versus supine position and the optimal body positions.","# Plain Language Summary: Body Position to Prevent Lung Infections in Hospital Patients on Breathing Machines

## What is this study about?

This study looked at whether the position a patient lies in can help prevent a serious lung infection called ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). This infection happens in patients who are on breathing machines in the hospital.

## Why does this matter?

VAP is a serious problem for very sick patients in the hospital. It makes them stay longer, costs more money, and can be life-threatening. Doctors have suggested that patients on breathing machines should lie in a semi-recumbent position (tilted up at about 30 to 45 degrees) instead of lying flat. However, doctors weren't sure if this really works.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at 10 studies that tested whether tilting patients up (semi-recumbent position) was better than laying them flat (supine position) for preventing VAP. The studies included 878 patients total.

## What did they find?

**Main finding:** Patients tilted up at 30 to 60 degrees had fewer suspected lung infections compared to patients lying completely flat. About 14% of tilted patients got the infection versus 40% of flat-lying patients.

**Other findings:** The tilted position did NOT make a difference in:
- Confirmed lung infections (harder to prove)
- Death rates in the hospital or ICU
- How long patients stayed in the hospital
- How long patients needed the breathing machine
- Antibiotic use
- Pressure sores

## Are there any concerns?

Yes. All the studies had problems with how they were done, which makes the results less reliable. Doctors also didn't report enough information about serious side effects like blood clots.

## Bottom line

Tilting patients up may help prevent suspected lung infections, but the evidence isn't strong enough to be completely sure. More and better studies are needed.","### Plain Language Summary

**Purpose of the Study**

This study looked at different ways to position patients who need help breathing with a machine (ventilator) to see if it helps prevent a lung infection called ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

**Who Was Studied**

The study included adults who needed ventilators to breathe.

**What Was Done**

Researchers compared two positions:
1. **Semi-recumbent position**: Patients are tilted up between 30° to 60°.
2. **Supine position**: Patients lie almost flat at 0° to 10°.

They also compared different angles within the semi-recumbent position.

**What the Study Found**

- **Clinically Suspected Pneumonia**: Semi-recumbent position reduced the risk compared to lying flat (14.3% vs. 40.2%).
- **Other Effects**: The study found no clear differences in confirmed pneumonia cases, chances of dying in the ICU or hospital, length of stay, time on the ventilator, use of antibiotics, or skin sores.

**Safety**

There were no reported safety issues, but not all possible side effects were checked.

**Conclusion**

Tilting patients up may help reduce suspected lung infections, but the evidence isn't strong. More research is needed to be sure about these results and to check other outcomes."
"Background
Long term levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease is associated with the development of motor complications including abnormal involuntary movements and a shortening response to each dose (wearing off phenomenon). It is thought that dopamine agonists can reduce the duration of immobile off periods and the need for levodopa therapy whilst maintaining or improving motor impairments and only minimally increasing dopaminergic adverse events. 
Objectives
To compare the efficacy and safety of adjuvant cabergoline therapy versus placebo in patients with Parkinson's disease, already established on levodopa and suffering from motor complications. 
Search methods
Electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Handsearching of the neurology literature as part of the Cochrane Movement Disorders Group's strategy. Examination of the reference lists of identified studies and other reviews. Contact with Pharmacia Upjohn Limited. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of cabergoline versus placebo in patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and long‐term complications of levodopa therapy. 
Data collection and analysis
Data was abstracted independently by the authors and differences settled by discussion. The outcome measures used included Parkinson's disease rating scales, levodopa dosage, off time measurements and the frequency of withdrawals and adverse events. 
Main results
Cabergoline has been compared with placebo in two phase II (6 ‐ 12 weeks) and one phase III randomised controlled trials (24 weeks). These were double‐blind, parallel group, multicentre studies including 268 patients with Parkinson's disease and motor complications. The reduction of 1.14 hours (WMD; 95% CI ‐0.06, 2.33; p = 0.06) in off time in favour of cabergoline was not statistically significant. Inadequate data on dyskinesia was collected either on rating scales or as adverse event reporting to allow a conclusion to be drawn. A small but statistically significant advantage of cabergoline over placebo was seen in one study for UPDRS ADL (part II) score and UPDRS motor score. No such advantage was seen in one other study due to small numbers of patients and the comparatively low doses of cabergoline used. No significant differences in Schwab and England scale were seen in two studies. Levodopa dose reduction was significantly greater with cabergoline (WMD 149.6 mg/d; 95% CI 94.1, 205.1; p < 0.00001). There was a trend towards more dopaminergic adverse events with cabergoline but this did not reach statistical significance at the p < 0.01 level. However, there was a trend towards fewer withdrawals from cabergoline. 
Authors' conclusions
In the management of the motor complications seen in Parkinson's disease, cabergoline can be used to reduce levodopa dose and modestly improve motor impairment and disability with an acceptable adverse event profile. These conclusions are based on, at best, medium term evidence.","Cabergoline for levodopa‐induced complications in Parkinson's disease
In the later stages of Parkinson's disease, side effects occur because of the use of levodopa treatment. These consist of involuntary writhing movements (choreoathetosis), painful cramps in the legs (dystonia) and a shortened response to each dose referred to as 'end‐of‐dose deterioration' or the 'wearing‐off effect'. Dopamine agonist drugs act by mimicking levodopa in the brain, but they do not cause these long‐term treatment complications when used as initial therapy. For this reason, dopamine agonists have for some years been added once these problems develop in the hope of improving them. Cabergoline is a new dopamine agonist recently licensed in the UK for the treatment of later Parkinson's disease. In this review, we will examine the trials performed with this drug to see how effective it is and what side effects it causes. 
Cabergoline has been compared with inactive placebo in two smaller and shorter (6 ‐ 12 weeks) studies and one larger, medium term trial (24 weeks). These trials included 268 patients with Parkinson's disease and motor complications. The average reduction in the time patients spent in the immobile off state was 1.1 hours greater with cabergoline compared with placebo, although this was not statistically significant. Inadequate data on dyskinesia was collected to allow a conclusion to be drawn. A small but significant advantage of cabergoline over placebo was seen in one study for activities of daily living and physical functioning. No such advantage was seen in one other study due to small numbers of patients and the comparatively low doses of cabergoline used. Levodopa dose reduction was greater with cabergoline by 145 mg per day. There was a trend towards more side effects with cabergoline but towards fewer withdrawals from cabergoline treatment. 
In the management of the motor complications seen in Parkinson's disease, cabergoline can be used to reduce levodopa dose and modestly improve motor function and activities of daily living with an acceptable side effect profile. This is based on, at best, medium term evidence. Further long term trials are required to compare the newer with the older dopamine agonists, particularly in terms of quality of life and cost.","# Plain Language Summary: Cabergoline for Parkinson's Disease

## What is this study about?
This review looked at whether a medicine called cabergoline could help people with Parkinson's disease who have been taking levodopa (a common Parkinson's medicine) for a long time and are experiencing problems.

## The Problem
When people take levodopa for many years, two main problems can happen:
- **Involuntary movements**: The body makes unwanted, jerky movements
- **Wearing off**: Each dose of medicine stops working sooner than it used to, leaving more time when the person can't move well

## What researchers wanted to know
Could adding cabergoline to levodopa help reduce these problems better than just taking levodopa alone?

## How they studied it
Researchers looked at three previous studies that compared cabergoline to a placebo (fake medicine). These studies included 268 people with Parkinson's disease who were having motor complications. The studies lasted 6 to 24 weeks.

## Main findings
- **Off time** (time when medicine isn't working): Cabergoline reduced this by about 1 hour, but this wasn't a strong enough result to be sure it really works
- **Movement and daily activities**: Cabergoline showed small improvements in some studies but not others
- **Levodopa dose**: People taking cabergoline were able to reduce their levodopa dose by about 150 mg per day
- **Side effects**: Cabergoline had slightly more side effects than placebo, but not a lot more
- **Staying in the study**: More people stayed on cabergoline compared to placebo

## Bottom line
Cabergoline may help people with Parkinson's take less levodopa and have slightly better movement, with acceptable side effects. However, the evidence is only medium-term (a few weeks to months).","### Plain Language Summary

**Purpose of the Study**

This study looked at how well a medicine called cabergoline works for people with Parkinson’s disease who have problems with their current treatment. The goal was to see if cabergoline can help these patients move better and lower their main medicine dose without causing too many side effects.

**Who Was Involved**

The study included 268 people with Parkinson’s disease who were already taking a medicine called levodopa but still had trouble moving.

**What Happened in the Study**

Participants were divided into two groups. One group took cabergoline, and the other took a placebo (a pill with no active medicine) for up to 24 weeks. The researchers measured how much time participants spent unable to move, how much levodopa they needed, and any side effects. They used special tests to check movement abilities.

**What the Results Showed**

- **Movement Time:** On average, people taking cabergoline spent about 1.14 hours less time being unable to move, but this was not a strong result.
  
- **Levodopa Dose:** People taking cabergoline could lower their levodopa dose more than those taking the placebo.

- **Side Effects:** Some people taking cabergoline had side effects, but they weren’t significantly more than those taking the placebo. Fewer people stopped taking cabergoline compared to placebo.

**Conclusions**

Cabergoline may help people with Parkinson’s disease reduce their main medicine and improve movement issues. However, the evidence is moderate, and more research is needed to confirm these findings."
"Background
Communication is a common element in all medical consultations, affecting a range of outcomes for doctors and patients. The increasing demand for medical students to be trained to communicate effectively has seen the emergence of interpersonal communication skills as core graduate competencies in medical training around the world. Medical schools have adopted a range of approaches to develop and evaluate these competencies. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of interventions for medical students that aim to improve interpersonal communication in medical consultations. 
Search methods
We searched five electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and ERIC (Educational Resource Information Centre) in September 2020, with no language, date, or publication status restrictions. We also screened reference lists of relevant articles and contacted authors of included studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs (C‐RCTs), and non‐randomised controlled trials (quasi‐RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of interventions delivered to students in undergraduate or graduate‐entry medical programmes. We included studies of interventions aiming to improve medical students’ interpersonal communication during medical consultations. Included interventions targeted communication skills associated with empathy, relationship building, gathering information, and explanation and planning, as well as specific communication tasks such as listening, appropriate structure, and question style. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently reviewed all search results, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias of included studies, and rated the quality of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We found 91 publications relating to 76 separate studies (involving 10,124 students): 55 RCTs, 9 quasi‐RCTs, 7 C‐RCTs, and 5 quasi‐C‐RCTs. We performed meta‐analysis according to comparison and outcome. Among both effectiveness and comparative effectiveness analyses, we separated outcomes reporting on overall communication skills, empathy, rapport or relationship building, patient perceptions/satisfaction, information gathering, and explanation and planning. Overall communication skills and empathy were further divided as examiner‐ or simulated patient‐assessed. The overall quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low, and there was high, unexplained heterogeneity.Overall, interventions had positive effects on most outcomes, but generally small effect sizes and evidence quality limit the conclusions that can be drawn. Communication skills interventions in comparison to usual curricula or control may improve both overall communication skills (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 1.31; 18 studies, 1356 participants; I² = 90%; low‐quality evidence) and empathy (SMD 0.64, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.05; 6 studies, 831 participants; I² = 86%; low‐quality evidence) when assessed by experts, but not by simulated patients. Students’ skills in information gathering probably also improve with educational intervention (SMD 1.07, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.54; 5 studies, 405 participants; I² = 78%; moderate‐quality evidence), but there may be little to no effect on students' rapport (SMD 0.18, 95% CI ‐0.15 to 0.51; 9 studies, 834 participants; I² = 81%; low‐quality evidence), and effects on information giving skills are uncertain (very low‐quality evidence). 
We are uncertain whether experiential interventions improve overall communication skills in comparison to didactic approaches (SMD 0.08, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.19; 4 studies, 1578 participants; I² = 4%; very low‐quality evidence). Electronic learning approaches may have little to no effect on students’ empathy scores (SMD ‐0.13, 95% CI ‐0.68 to 0.43; 3 studies, 421 participants; I² = 82%; low‐quality evidence) or on rapport (SMD 0.02, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.38; 3 studies, 176 participants; I² = 19%; moderate‐quality evidence) compared to face‐to‐face approaches. There may be small negative effects of electronic interventions on information giving skills (low‐quality evidence), and effects on information gathering skills are uncertain (very low‐quality evidence).  
Personalised/specific feedback probably improves overall communication skills to a small degree in comparison to generic or no feedback (SMD 0.58, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.87; 6 studies, 502 participants; I² = 56%; moderate‐quality evidence). There may be small positive effects of personalised feedback on empathy and information gathering skills (low quality), but effects on rapport are uncertain (very low quality), and we found no evidence on information giving skills. 
We are uncertain whether role‐play with simulated patients outperforms peer role‐play in improving students’ overall communication skills (SMD 0.17, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.67; 4 studies, 637 participants; I² = 87%; very low‐quality evidence). There may be little to no difference between effects of simulated patient and peer role‐play on students' empathy (low‐quality evidence) with no evidence on other outcomes for this comparison. 
Descriptive syntheses of results that could not be included in meta‐analyses across outcomes and comparisons were mixed, as were effects of different interventions and comparisons on specific communication skills assessed by the included trials. Quality of evidence was downgraded due to methodological limitations across several risk of bias domains, high unexplained heterogeneity, and imprecision of results.In general, results remain consistent in sensitivity analysis based on risk of bias and adjustment for clustering. No adverse effects were reported.  
Authors' conclusions
This review represents a substantial body of evidence from which to draw, but further research is needed to strengthen the quality of the evidence base, to consider the long‐term effects of interventions on students’ behaviour as they progress through training and into practice, and to assess effects of interventions on patient outcomes. Efforts to standardise assessment and evaluation of interpersonal skills will strengthen future research efforts.","Communication skills interventions for medical students
What are the best ways to teach medical students how to talk to patients? 
Teaching interpersonal skills 
We use interpersonal skills every day when we talk and interact with other people. Interpersonal skills include communication skills such as listening, speaking, and asking questions. Good communication between doctor and patient is vital for all medical consultations. Doctors need to build relationships, show empathy, gather information, explain concepts, and plan treatment with their patients. 
Medical students need to prove they are competent in interpersonal and communication skills before they graduate. Approaches to teaching medical students these skills include face‐to‐face teaching, online courses, programmes that give students personalised or tailored feedback, and use of role‐play with peers or with actors playing the role of the patient. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
Medical schools and universities around the world use different approaches to teach interpersonal and communication skills. We wanted to find out which types of educational programmes work best. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed educational programmes to teach interpersonal and communication skills to medical students. 
Search date: we included evidence published up to September 2020. 
What we found 
We found 90 relevant studies involving 10,124 students, conducted in the USA and in countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia Pacific. These studies assessed educational programmes to teach interpersonal and communication skills, including individual role‐play and feedback, and large group demonstrations. Programmes were delivered by face‐to‐face teaching, by video, or online. In most studies, results were assessed immediately after the educational programme concluded, and up to 12 months later. 
We compared the results of studies conducted to find out how the different programmes affected: 
· overall communication skills;
· understanding of what another person is feeling (empathy);
· relationship building or understanding one another's feelings or ideas (rapport);
· gathering of information, including patients' satisfaction, understanding, or views; and 
· explaining and planning (giving of information).
What are the main results of our review? 
Comparing interpersonal programmes against the usual educational programmes or being on a waiting list for an interpersonal programme showed that these programmes: 
· may slightly improve students' overall communication skills (evidence from 18 studies, with 1356 students) and empathy (6 studies; 831 students); 
· probably improve skills in gathering information about the patient's views (5 studies, 405 students); but 
· may have little to no effect on rapport skills (9 studies, 834 students).
We are uncertain about how the interpersonal programmes affected skills in giving information (5 studies, 659 students). 
We are uncertain how online or self‐taught programmes affected students' overall communication skills (4 studies, 1578 students) or skills in gathering information (1 study, 164 students) compared with face‐to‐face teaching. 
Online or self‐directed programmes compared with face‐to‐face teaching:
· may have little to no effect on students' empathy skills (3 studies, 421 students);
· probably have little to no effect on rapport skills (3 studies, 176 students); but
· may slightly reduce skills in giving information (1 study, 122 students).
Programmes that give students personalised or tailored feedback compared with those that involve general or no feedback: 
· probably slightly improved overall communication skills (6 studies, 502 students); and 
· may slightly improve empathy skills (1 study, 66 students) and skills in gathering information (1 study, 48 students). 
We are uncertain how programmes with personalised or tailored feedback affected rapport skills (1 study, 190 students). No studies reported results for effects on skills in giving information. 
We are uncertain whether programmes involving role‐play with people acting as patients improved students' overall communication skills (4 studies, 637 students) compared with programmes involving role‐play with peers. Role‐play with people acting as patients may slightly improve empathy skills (2 studies, 213 students). No studies reported results for how role‐play with people acting as patients affected skills in rapport or gathering and giving of information. 
No studies reported any unwanted effects for any of the education programmes assessed.
How confident are we in our results? 
We are moderately confident that interpersonal education programmes and programmes involving personalised, specific feedback probably improve overall communication skills. 
We are not confident in our results for the other types of programmes. Some studies had limitations in the ways they were designed, such as how students taking part were assigned to different groups. Other studies had widely varying results, and some had short follow‐up times. Further research is likely to change our results. 
Key messages 
Interpersonal education programmes for medical students had positive effects on most of the interpersonal skills we looked at, although these effects were small and our confidence in some of our results is low. 
Programmes that include personalised feedback probably improve medical students' overall communication skills more than programmes that involve general or no feedback. 
Online or self‐directed programmes may make little to no difference in improving skills in empathy or rapport compared with face‐to‐face teaching.","# Plain Language Summary: Teaching Communication Skills to Medical Students

## What is this study about?

This review looked at different ways to teach medical students how to communicate better with patients. Good communication between doctors and patients is important and affects how well patients do. Medical schools around the world want to make sure their students learn these skills.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for studies that tested different teaching methods for communication skills. They looked at 76 separate studies involving over 10,000 medical students. The studies compared different ways of teaching communication, such as:
- Special communication training versus regular classes
- Learning online versus learning face-to-face
- Getting personalized feedback versus general feedback
- Practice with fake patients versus practice with other students

## What did they find?

**Overall, communication training helped students improve**, but the improvements were often small:

- Students who got special communication training did better at overall communication skills and showing empathy (understanding patients' feelings)
- Students improved at gathering information from patients
- Students did not improve much at building good relationships with patients
- It's unclear if online learning works as well as in-person learning
- Getting personalized feedback (specific comments about what to improve) helped more than general feedback
- Practice with fake patients worked about the same as practice with other students

## Important notes

- The quality of evidence was mixed—some studies were better than others
- No harmful effects were reported
- Researchers say more studies are needed to see if these skills help students stay better at communication as they become doctors and treat real patients","### Plain Language Summary

**Background**
Good communication is important in healthcare. Doctors need to talk well with patients. Medical schools everywhere are teaching students how to communicate better, but they use different methods.

**Objective**
The main goal was to see how well different training methods help medical students improve their communication skills with patients.

**How We Found the Information**
We looked through several big research databases in September 2020. We didn't limit by language or date and also checked references and contacted study authors.

**What We Looked At**
We included different types of studies that tested how well communication training worked for medical students. These trainings focused on skills like showing empathy, building relationships, listening, and asking the right questions.

**Study Details**
- We found 91 articles covering 76 studies with 10,124 students.
- These studies used different methods to teach communication and measured various skills.

**Key Findings**
- Most training methods had positive effects, but the improvements were usually small and the evidence wasn’t always strong.
- Training seemed to help improve general communication skills and empathy as judged by experts, but not by pretend patients.
- Students got better at gathering information, but there was little change in building relationships or explaining things to patients.

**Different Methods’ Effects**
- Learning through e-courses didn’t seem as effective for empathy and relationship skills compared to face-to-face learning.
- Personalized feedback might help communication a bit more than generic feedback.
- Practicing with pretend patients vs. classmates didn’t show much difference.

**Conclusions**
We learned a lot from these studies, but more research is needed. It will be helpful to know how these skills hold up over time and how they affect patient care. Future studies could be better if they use standard ways to measure skills. No negative effects were reported from the training."
"Background
Work participation of patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA) is important not only economically but also for physical and psychological health. There is no Cochrane Review to date on studies of non‐pharmacological interventions specifically aimed at preventing job loss in people with IA. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of non‐pharmacological interventions that aim to prevent job loss, work absenteeism or improve work functioning for employees with IA (rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), other spondylarthritis (SpA) or IA associated with connective tissue diseases, such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)). 
Search methods
We searched the following databases from inception up to 30 April 2014; The Cochrane Library (including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, i.e. CENTRAL and DARE), MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE (Embase.com), CINAHL (EbSCOhost), ClinicalTrials.gov and PsycINFO (ProQuest). We did not impose language restrictions in the search. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated interventions aimed at preventing job loss in adults of working age (18 to 65 years) diagnosed with IA, including RA, AS, PsA, SpA or other types of IA. Primary outcomes were job loss and sickness absenteeism and the secondary outcome was work functioning. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included RCTs. 
Main results
We included three RCTs with a total of 414 participants at risk of job loss. The majority of participants had IA, most with RA and to a lesser degree AS. The interventions aimed to prevent job loss and improve work functioning in several ways: firstly by evaluating work changes or adaptations and secondly by providing any person‐directed interventions including vocational counselling, advice or education. Interventions directly targeted at the work environment were minimal and included workplace visits (one trial) or any actions by an occupational physician (one trial). The duration or dose of the interventions varied from two 1.5‐hour sessions (one RCT) over five months, two consultation and multidisciplinary treatments during three months (one RCT), to six to eight individual or group sessions over six months (also one RCT). All participants were recruited through rheumatology clinics, both in or outside hospitals. Included trials investigated job loss (n = two RCTs; 382 participants), work absenteeism and work functioning (n = one RCT; 32 participants). Overall, we evaluated the two smaller trials as having a high risk of bias and the large trial as having a low risk of bias. Trials showed marked differences in how they performed on risk of bias items, particularly on performance bias. 
We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach and judged there to be very low quality evidence across the three reported outcomes. Of the two RCTs investigating job loss, the larger one (n = 242 participants) reported a large statistically significant reduction in job loss (relative risk (RR) = 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.68) and the other RCT (n = 140) reported similar effects in both groups, although the CI was very wide (RR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.06). The latter one probably suffered from performance bias and we judged it to have a high risk of bias. The one small trial investigating sickness absenteeism found uncertain results at six months' follow‐up (MD = ‐2.42 days, 95% CI ‐5.03 to 0.19). Finally, in the same small trial investigating work functioning using the Rheumatoid Arthritis‐Work Instability Scale (RA‐WIS), there was a moderate improvement of intermediate term work functioning (six months; scale range 0 to 23; mean improvement ‐4.67 points, 95% CI ‐8.43 to ‐0.91). We identified no adverse effects in the publications of the three trials. 
Authors' conclusions
This Cochrane review of three RCTs found very low quality evidence overall for job loss prevention interventions having an effect on job loss, work absenteeism and work functioning in workers with inflammatory arthritis. While this review highlights that further high quality RCTs are required, the results suggest that these strategies have potential to be effective.","Non‐drug interventions for helping workers with inflammatory arthritis stay at work
Background 
Inflammatory arthritis (IA), also called rheumatism, is a group of diseases that cause long‐lasting pain, stiffness and swelling in the joints. These symptoms make it difficult to move and make you feel tired, which in turn can make it difficult to work. The most common types of IA are: rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Worldwide about 3% of people have IA. The disease usually begins when people are between 30 to 40 years old, at a time when they still have many years of working life left. Therefore, it is important to know if there are effective ways in which we can help people with IA stay at work. This Cochrane Review focuses on non‐drug interventions. 
Trials we found 
We searched the available literature up to 30 April 2014. We included three randomised controlled trials with 414 participants who had IA and who were at risk of losing their jobs. These trials first evaluated how the work environment could be adapted and then provided counselling, advice or education for work problems. One trial gave two 1.5‐hour sessions over five months. Another trial gave two consultation and multidisciplinary treatments during three months. The third trial gave six to eight individual or group sessions over six months. The included trials compared the effects of interventions to usual care (two trials) or to written information only (one trial). Two of the included trials measured the effect of the intervention on job loss (382 participants) when the third measured effect on work absenteeism and work functioning (32 participants). 
What the research says 
When considered together, the evidence from the three trials was of very low quality. Two trials found different results on job loss measured at two years' follow‐up: one trial on job counselling found a large reduction in people who lost their job and the other trial found similar effects in both groups. Another trial did not find a considerable effect on absenteeism at six months' follow‐up but found a moderate improvement in work functioning. 
Conclusions 
Because of positive results from one RCT with long term follow‐up, we see potential for job loss prevention interventions in helping workers with inflammatory arthritis to stay at work. The certainty of these results is limited by the very low quality evidence of the three RCTs overall.","# Plain Language Summary: Work Support Programs for People with Inflammatory Arthritis

## What is this study about?

This review looked at programs designed to help people with inflammatory arthritis (a group of joint diseases) keep their jobs or work better. The researchers wanted to know if these programs actually work.

## Who was studied?

The review included three research studies with a total of 414 working adults (ages 18–65) who had inflammatory arthritis and were at risk of losing their jobs. Most had rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with some having other types like ankylosing spondylitis (AS).

## What did the programs do?

The programs tried to help people keep working in different ways:
- Giving advice and education about work
- Offering career counseling
- Suggesting changes to the job or workplace
- Having occupational doctors visit the workplace

Programs lasted anywhere from a few short sessions over a few months to six to eight sessions spread over six months.

## What were the results?

**Job loss:** One larger study found that the program reduced job loss significantly. A smaller study found similar results in both groups.

**Time off work:** One small study found unclear results about whether the program reduced sick days.

**Work ability:** One small study showed moderate improvement in how well people could do their jobs after six months.

**Safety:** No harmful effects were reported.

## What does this mean?

These programs show promise for helping people with inflammatory arthritis stay employed, but the evidence is not yet strong. More high-quality research is needed.","### Plain Language Summary

#### Purpose of the Study
This study looked at ways to help people with inflammatory arthritis (IA) keep their jobs, miss less work, and do better at work. Inflammatory arthritis includes conditions like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and others.

#### Who Was Involved?
The study included 414 adults aged 18 to 65 who were at risk of losing their jobs due to IA. Most of the participants had rheumatoid arthritis.

#### What Did They Do?
The researchers tested different non-drug methods to help people keep their jobs. These methods included:
- Making changes at work or adapting tasks.
- Providing personal support, like job counseling, advice, or education.

Some studies included workplace visits or involved an occupational doctor. The activities lasted from a few sessions over months to several individual or group meetings.

#### What Did They Find?
- Two studies looked at job loss. One study with 242 people found a significant reduction in job loss, while the other with 140 people didn’t show clear differences.
- One small study checked work absences and job performance but found uncertain results.
- Participants improved a bit in how they handled work after six months.

The overall quality of the evidence was very low, meaning more research is needed.

#### Safety
No harmful effects were reported in the studies.

#### Conclusion
The study suggests that some non-drug methods might help people with IA keep their jobs, but the proof is not strong. More research is needed to confirm these findings."
"Background
Fibromyalgia is a chronic widespread pain condition affecting millions of people worldwide. Current pharmacotherapies are often ineffective and poorly tolerated. Combining different agents could provide superior pain relief and possibly also fewer side effects. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of combination pharmacotherapy compared to monotherapy or placebo, or both, for the treatment of fibromyalgia pain in adults. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase to September 2017. We also searched reference lists of other reviews and trials registries. 
Selection criteria
Double‐blind, randomised controlled trials comparing combinations of two or more drugs to placebo or other comparators, or both, for the treatment of fibromyalgia pain. 
Data collection and analysis
From all studies, we extracted data on: participant‐reported pain relief of 30% or 50% or greater; patient global impression of clinical change (PGIC) much or very much improved or very much improved; any other pain‐related outcome of improvement; withdrawals (lack of efficacy, adverse events), participants experiencing any adverse event, serious adverse events, and specific adverse events (e.g. somnolence and dizziness). The primary comparison was between combination and one or all single‐agent comparators. We also assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table. 
Main results
We identified 16 studies with 1474 participants. Three studies combined a non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a benzodiazepine (306 participants); two combined amitriptyline with fluoxetine (89 participants); two combined amitriptyline with a different agent (92 participants); two combined melatonin with an antidepressant (164 participants); one combined carisoprodol, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and caffeine (58 participants); one combined tramadol and paracetamol (acetaminophen) (315 participants); one combined malic acid and magnesium (24 participants); one combined a monoamine oxidase inhibitor with 5‐hydroxytryptophan (200 participants); and one combined pregabalin with duloxetine (41 participants). Six studies compared the combination of multiple agents with each component alone and with inactive placebo; three studies compared combination pharmacotherapy with each individual component but did not include an inactive placebo group; two studies compared the combination of two agents with only one of the agents alone; and three studies compared the combination of two or more agents only with inactive placebo. 
Heterogeneity among studies in terms of class of agents evaluated, specific combinations used, outcomes reported, and doses given prevented any meta‐analysis. None of the combinations of drugs found provided sufficient data for analysis compared with placebo or other comparators for our preferred outcomes. We therefore provide a narrative description of results. There was no or inadequate evidence in any comparison for primary and secondary outcomes. Two studies only reported any primary outcomes of interest (patient‐reported pain relief of 30%, or 50%, or greater). For each 'Risk of bias' item, only half or fewer of studies had unequivocal low risk of bias. Small size and selective reporting were common as high risk of bias. 
Our GRADE assessment was therefore very low for primary outcomes of pain relief of 30% or 50% or greater, PGIC much or very much improved or very much improved, any pain‐related outcome, participants experiencing any adverse event, any serious adverse event, or withdrawing because of an adverse event. 
Three studies found some evidence that combination pharmacotherapy reduced pain compared to monotherapy; these trials tested three different combinations: melatonin and amitriptyline, fluoxetine and amitriptyline, and pregabalin and duloxetine. Adverse events experienced by participants were not serious, and where they were reported (in 12 out of 16 studies), all participants experienced them, regardless of treatment. Common adverse events were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, and headache. 
Authors' conclusions
There are few, large, high‐quality trials comparing combination pharmacotherapy with monotherapy for fibromyalgia, consequently limiting evidence to support or refute the use of combination pharmacotherapy for fibromyalgia.","Combinations of drugs versus single drugs to treat fibromyalgia pain in adults
Bottom line 
There is no good evidence to prove or disprove that combining drugs is better than using single drugs for fibromyalgia. 
Background 
People with fibromyalgia experience constant, widespread pain, sleep problems, and fatigue. Common drugs such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen are not usually effective. Medicines used to treat epilepsy or depression can sometimes be effective for fibromyalgia and other forms of long‐lasting pain where there may be nerve damage. Many individuals with fibromyalgia take many different drugs to deal with pain. We did this review to find the evidence about using combinations of drugs compared to single drugs. 
Study characteristics 
In September 2017 we searched for clinical trials where combinations of medicines were used for fibromyalgia pain in adults. We found 16 studies evaluating combinations of drugs versus one drug for fibromyalgia pain. 
Key results 
These studies looked at combinations of all sorts of different drugs, but did not provide enough data to draw any conclusions. Many of the studies did not directly compare a combination of drugs with each single drug. They sometimes compared a combination of medicines with only one of the medicines in the combination, or with only placebo. This limited our ability to make any conclusions. 
Most studies did not report any of the outcomes important to people with fibromyalgia. Some studies showed that a combination of drugs is better at reducing pain than one drug alone, but other studies showed that one drug alone is better than a combination of drugs. Other studies did not find any difference between combinations of drugs and single drugs. 
Side effects were not severe, and generally were not different between combination therapy and monotherapy. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low‐quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High‐quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. Overall, the quality of evidence for important outcomes was very low. None of the combinations of drugs provided enough information for our preferred outcomes. We think that new studies will be very likely to change any conclusions drawn from these studies.","# Plain Language Summary: Combination Medicines for Fibromyalgia Pain

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether taking **two or more pain medicines together** works better than taking just one medicine or a fake pill (placebo) for fibromyalgia—a condition that causes widespread pain throughout the body.

## Why is this important?

Many people with fibromyalgia don't get good pain relief from single medicines, and some have trouble with side effects. Doctors wondered if combining different medicines might help more people feel better.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for high-quality studies that tested **combinations of two or more medicines** against single medicines or placebo. They found **16 studies with 1,474 people** total.

The medicine combinations tested included:
- Pain relievers + sleep medicines
- Antidepressants + antidepressants
- Melatonin + antidepressants
- Other various combinations

## What did they find?

**The main finding:** There isn't enough strong evidence yet to say whether combining medicines works better than taking one medicine alone.

**What we do know:**
- Only 3 studies showed that some combinations might reduce pain better than single medicines
- The combinations that showed promise were: melatonin + amitriptyline, fluoxetine + amitriptyline, and pregabalin + duloxetine
- Side effects (like nausea, dizziness, sleepiness, and headaches) happened in almost all groups—whether people took combination medicines, single medicines, or placebo
- Side effects were generally not serious

## Bottom line

We need **more large, well-designed studies** to know if combining medicines really helps fibromyalgia pain better than taking one medicine.","## Plain Language Summary

### Study Purpose
This study looked at how well different combinations of medications work for treating fibromyalgia pain in adults. It also checked if these medication combinations are safe and easy to take.

### What Was Done
Researchers searched for studies up to September 2017. They looked for high-quality trials where adults with fibromyalgia were given two or more drugs together and compared them with people who received either one drug or a placebo (a fake treatment).

### Who Participated
There were 16 studies with a total of 1,474 participants. Different combinations of medications were tested, like pain relievers with antidepressants or sleep aids.

### Main Findings
- The study found that combining medications might help reduce fibromyalgia pain. 
- The combinations tested were melatonin and amitriptyline, fluoxetine and amitriptyline, and pregabalin and duloxetine.
- Some people did feel better with these combinations compared to taking one drug alone.
- Most of the side effects reported were mild, like nausea, dizziness, feeling sleepy, and headaches.

### Study Limitations
- Many studies were small or had problems that might affect the results.
- The evidence was not strong enough to say for sure if combination treatments are better than single drugs.

### Conclusion
There isn’t enough strong evidence to say for sure if using combinations of medications is better than using one medication at a time for fibromyalgia. More large, high-quality studies are needed."
"Background
Across the developed world, an estimated 150,000 to 300,000 people are treated annually with pelvic radiotherapy and 80% will develop gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms during treatment. Acute GI symptoms are associated with a greater risk of chronic, often debilitating, GI symptoms. Up to one‐third of patients are malnourished before pelvic radiotherapy and up to four‐fifths of patients lose weight during treatment. Malnutrition is linked to a higher risk of GI toxicity, which can lead to breaks in radiotherapy and early cessation of chemotherapy, thus compromising the efficacy of the primary cancer treatment. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of nutritional interventions for reducing GI toxicity in adults undergoing radical pelvic radiotherapy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Issue 4, 2012, MEDLINE and EMBASE to May 2012. We handsearched the citation lists of included studies and previous systematic reviews identified to identify further relevant trials. 
Selection criteria
We included studies if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or non‐randomised studies with concurrent comparison groups including quasi‐randomised trials, cluster RCTs, non‐randomised trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and case series of 30 or more patients. We only included studies if they assessed the effect of a nutritional intervention in adults aged 18 years or over undergoing radical pelvic radiotherapy as part of anticancer treatment for a primary pelvic malignancy. We excluded patients with stomas and a previous history of inflammatory bowel disease. Nutritional support interventions could be provided at any stage before or during pelvic radiotherapy and included dietary counselling; dietary modification of fibre, lactose or fat; supplementary foods or drinks or fortified foods; standard oral nutrition supplements including polymeric‐, peptide‐ or amino acid‐based supplements and those where novel substrates have been added; enteral tube feeds; or parenteral nutrition (partial or total). We excluded probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors to obtain missing data. We assessed bias for each of the included studies using the bias assessment tables in the Cochrane software Review Manager5. We performed meta‐analysis, when indicated, using the Mantel‐Haenszel fixed‐effect method or inverse variance fixed‐effect method displayed with heterogeneity. We undertook meta‐analyses on trials evaluating dietary modification against standard treatment for diarrhoea at the end of radiotherapy and for change in weight from baseline to end of radiotherapy. 
Main results
The searches identified 7558 titles, and we excluded 7513 during title and abstract searches. We reviewed 45 papers in full, and excluded 39. We identified four studies on handsearching of the references, which, along with the six eligible papers from the database search, led to 10 studies being included. Four studies, three of which were RCTs and one prospective study, investigated the effect of elemental diet on GI symptoms; one RCT investigated the effect of dietary modification and elemental diet; and five RCTs investigated dietary modification. Studies were varied in terms of risk of bias. Data were dichotomised for presence and absence of diarrhoea at the end of radiotherapy for four trials evaluating dietary modification comprising modified fat, lactose, fibre or combinations of these dietary changes. A reduction in diarrhoea was demonstrated with nutritional intervention (risk ratio (RR) 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.87, four studies, 413 participants, moderate quality of evidence) with low heterogeneity (Chi2 = 3.50, I2 = 14%). Two trials evaluating dietary modification on weight change (comparing baseline and end of radiotherapy) showed no difference between intervention or control (mean difference (MD) ‐0.57 kg; 95% CI ‐1.22 to 0.09) with low heterogeneity (Chi2 = 1.41, I2 = 29%). Generally adverse effects were poorly reported in included studies. Elemental diet in particular was poorly tolerated. GI symptoms or toxicity > 6 months after radiotherapy was not reported in included studies 
Authors' conclusions
There have been benefits demonstrated with dietary modification during pelvic radiotherapy to reduce diarrhoea. Those diets included single interventions or combinations of modified fat, lactose‐restriction, fat‐restriction and fibre supplementation. We were unable to meta‐analyse elemental diet, as data were not available. We considered some of the studies to be at high risk of bias. There have been recent advances in novel, more targeted radiotherapy techniques, such that the findings of older studies need to be interpreted with caution. In addition, there were problems with compliance and palatability with some of the interventions, particularly elemental diet, which limits its usefulness in clinical practice.","Do nutritional interventions reduce gastrointestinal toxicity in adults undergoing radical pelvic radiotherapy? 
Background 
Research has shown that nutrition and radiotherapy have effects on each other. People with malnutrition tend to get more bowel side effects during radiotherapy. It has also been shown that many people lose weight during radiotherapy due to the treatment side effects. These side effects can lead to some people needing gaps in their radiotherapy and sometimes they even need to stop it entirely. This can reduce the chance of cancer cure. This review looked at the literature for providing extra nourishment or changes in diet to patients before or during radiotherapy, to determine whether this is of benefit in terms of reducing bowel symptoms, improving nutritional status and quality of life. 
Study characteristics 
Searches of all relevant sources of medical information identified 7558 articles, and, after initial screening of all these articles, we selected 45 as being suitable for this review. On reading the summaries of these 45 trials, 10 were suitable to be included in this review. We included trials that looked at the effects of a nutritional intervention in adults aged 18 years or over having radical pelvic radiotherapy as part of anticancer treatment for a primary pelvic cancer. We excluded patients with stomas and a previous history of inflammatory bowel disease. 
Key results 
Results showed that studies evaluating dietary changes, including changes in dietary fat, fibre and lactose, during radiotherapy reduced diarrhoea at the end of treatment. However, these dietary changes did not seem to improve patients' weights. 
Quality of the evidence 
While some changes to diet during radiotherapy may benefit patients by reducing diarrhoea, it is important to recognise that some of the studies reviewed were dated and there have been changes in radiotherapy technique since then that may give patients less diarrhoea anyway. In addition, many studies were of poor quality and, therefore, only a small number were able to be included in this review. Some interventions described, for example, having to take a liquid diet, were not acceptable as many patients found them difficult to tolerate and were unable to take them completely.","# Plain Language Summary: Nutritional Help During Pelvic Radiation Treatment

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether special diets and nutrition support can help reduce stomach and bowel problems in adults getting radiation treatment to the pelvic area (lower belly) for cancer.

## Why does this matter?

Each year, about 150,000 to 300,000 people in developed countries receive pelvic radiation. About 8 out of 10 people get stomach and bowel problems during treatment, like diarrhea. These problems can cause weight loss and make it hard for patients to finish their cancer treatment. The researchers wanted to know if changing what people eat could help.

## What did they do?

The researchers searched for studies that tested different types of nutritional help, such as:
- Advice about what to eat
- Changing diet (less fat, less lactose, more or less fiber)
- Nutrition drinks and supplements
- Tube feeding

They looked for studies comparing these approaches to regular treatment.

## What did they find?

The researchers reviewed 10 studies involving 413 participants. The main finding was:

**Dietary changes helped reduce diarrhea.** People who followed modified diets (with changes to fat, lactose, or fiber) had fewer cases of diarrhea at the end of radiation compared to those on regular diets.

**Weight loss was similar in both groups.** Changing diet didn't prevent weight loss during treatment.

## Important notes

- Some diets were hard for people to follow and didn't taste good
- Many studies didn't clearly report side effects
- Older studies may not apply to newer radiation techniques
- Long-term stomach and bowel problems (after 6 months) weren't studied","### Plain Language Summary

Every year, many people get pelvic radiotherapy for cancer treatment. However, 80% of them experience stomach and digestion problems. These problems can get worse and lead to issues like weight loss and malnutrition, which can affect their cancer treatment.

**What Was Studied?**
This study looked at how changing a person's diet might help reduce these stomach problems for adults getting pelvic radiotherapy.

**Who Was Included?**
The study included adults over 18 who were getting pelvic radiotherapy for cancer. It did not include people with certain digestive conditions.

**What Did They Do?**
Researchers explored different ways of changing diets, such as adjusting fat, lactose, and fiber intake, or providing special nutrient-rich foods and drinks. They also gave advice on eating and used other nutritional supplements, but did not include options like probiotics.

**What Were the Findings?**
The study found that changing diets could help reduce stomach problems like diarrhea. However, the special diets were sometimes hard for people to stick to, especially the ""elemental diet,"" which wasn't well tolerated. 

**Conclusion**
Adjusting the diet during pelvic radiotherapy can reduce some digestive problems, but some diet changes are tough to follow. Future studies might consider using newer radiotherapy methods.

**Safety and Challenges**
Some diet changes were hard to follow or not enjoyable, which made them less useful in real life. Safety info wasn't always clear in the studies.

**Important Note**
While dietary changes can help, new and better ways to give radiotherapy might also make a difference, so it's important to update findings with current practices."
"Background
In primary care between 10% and 35% of all visits concern patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS). MUPS are associated with high medical consumption, significant disabilities and psychiatric morbidity. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of consultation letters (CLs) to assist primary care physicians or occupational health physicians in the treatment of patients with MUPS and diagnostic subgroups. 
Search methods
We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Controlled Trials Registers, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE  (1966‐2009), MEDLINE In Process (2009‐08‐17), EMBASE (1974‐2009), PSYCINFO (1980‐2009) and CINAHL (1982‐2009). We screened the references lists of selected studies and consulted experts in the field to identify any additional, eligible RCTs. 
Selection criteria
RCTs of CLs for patients with MUPS being treated in primary care settings.
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened the abstracts of the studies identified through the searches and independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We resolved any disagreement by discussion with a third review author. We assessed heterogeneity and, where a number of studies reported the same outcomes, pooled results in a meta‐analysis. 
Main results
We included six RCTs, with a total of 449 patients. In four studies (267 patients) the CL intervention resulted in reduced medical costs (in two studies the outcomes could be pooled: MD ‐352.55 US Dollars (95% CI ‐522.32 to ‐182.78)) and improved physical functioning (three studies, MD 5.71 (95% CI 4.11 to 7.31)). In two studies (182 patients) the intervention was a joint consultation with a psychiatrist in presence of the physician, and resulted in reduced severity of somatization symptoms, reduced medical consumption and improved social functioning. 
Authors' conclusions
There is limited evidence that a CL is effective in terms of medical costs and improvement of physical functioning for patients with MUPS in primary care. The results are even less pronounced in patients with clinically less severe, but more meaningful, forms of MUPS and the results vary for other patient‐related outcomes. All studies, except one, were performed in the United States and therefore the results can not be generalized directly to countries with other healthcare systems. Furthermore all studies were small and of only moderate quality. There is very limited evidence that a joint consultation with the patient by a psychiatrist in the presence of the physician, together with the provision of a CL, reduces severity of somatization symptoms and medical consumption.","Consultation letters for use by primary care physicians in their care of patients with physical symptoms for which no organic cause can be found 
In 10% to 35% of all consultations in primary care, no organic cause can be found for the physical symptoms of the patient. Patients may present with symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, dizziness, non‐specific low back pain and chest pain. Such symptoms can lead to frequent consultations with the physician and high medical costs as well as causing considerable worry and disability for the patient. Patients suffering from MUPS are more likely than the average patient to experience depressive and anxiety disorders. Studies have reported positive effects of screening by a psychiatrist in the treatment of MUPS in primary care. After screening, the psychiatrist sends the primary care physician a 'consultation letter' (CL) which states the diagnosis and that patients are best helped by: 1) having their symptoms taken seriously; 2) not being told their symptoms are 'all in your head'; 3) not being referred for further investigation unless there is a clear indication of a somatic disorder; 4) undergoing a physical examination at each visit; and 5) being seen at regular intervals. 
In our review we found six studies, with a total of 449 patients, in which one of two interventions were applied. One intervention (four studies, 267 patients) was a CL following a consultation between the patient and the psychiatrist; the other (two studies, 182 patients) was a CL following a joint consultation between patient, psychiatrist and primary care physician. In each case comparison was against care as usual, provided by the primary care physician. The first intervention resulted in reduced medical costs (three studies) and improved physical functioning (three studies). We found evidence for a slight reduction in the severity of the MUPS, reduced medical consumption and improved social functioning following the second intervention, although in only one of two studies assessed. There are serious limitations in generalizability of the results to modern healthcare: most trials reported doctor‐related outcomes with patient‐related outcomes varying in results; the intervention appears to be far more effective for the most serious but rare disorders, and less so in the more common forms of MUPS; five of the six studies were performed in the United States and four studies before 1995. Furthermore the studied populations were small and five of the six studies were of moderate quality. 
Our final conclusion is that CLs may be helpful for physicians who treat patients with MUPS (based on the provider‐related outcomes). However, until further studies are conducted to find out if the intervention results in improved patient‐related outcomes, the overall effectiveness of CLs cannot be demonstrated.","# Plain Language Summary: Consultation Letters for Patients with Physical Symptoms

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether special letters from doctors can help patients who have physical symptoms that doctors cannot explain with medical tests. These patients often visit the doctor many times and use a lot of medical care.

## Who was studied?

The review included 449 patients from six different studies. All patients had unexplained physical symptoms and were being treated by primary care doctors (regular doctors who see patients for general health care).

## What was tested?

Researchers tested whether consultation letters—written messages from specialists to primary care doctors—could help treat these patients better. In some studies, a psychiatrist (a doctor who treats mental health) also met with the patient and the primary care doctor together.

## What were the results?

**The consultation letters helped in these ways:**
- Patients had lower medical costs (they spent less money on doctor visits and medical care)
- Patients' physical functioning improved (they could do more activities)

**When a psychiatrist met with the patient and doctor together:**
- Patients' symptoms got better
- Medical costs went down
- Patients' social life improved (they got along better with others)

## Important limitations

- All studies were small and not very high quality
- Most studies were done in the United States, so results may not apply to other countries
- The benefits were modest overall","### Plain Language Summary

**Purpose of the Study**

This study looked at how helpful certain letters from doctors, called consultation letters (CLs), are for treating patients with health problems that don't have a clear medical cause. These types of health issues often lead to many doctor visits and can impact daily life.

**Who Was Involved?**

The study checked six research trials with a total of 449 patients from primary care settings. Most of these studies were done in the United States.

**What Was Done?**

Researchers tested if sending consultation letters to doctors could help them care for patients with unexplained symptoms. Some studies also included meetings with a psychiatrist and the doctor together with the patient.

**Results**

- **Consultation Letters:** In four studies involving 267 patients, using consultation letters lowered medical costs and helped patients feel better physically.
- **Joint Consultations:** In two studies with 182 patients, having both a psychiatrist and doctor meet with patients reduced their symptoms and doctor visits, and improved social life.

**Conclusions**

The study found some proof that consultation letters might help lower costs and improve physical health for these patients. However, the benefits were not as clear for certain other symptoms and results. Since most studies were small and held in the U.S., the findings may not apply everywhere. Using both consultation letters and joint meetings might slightly help in reducing symptoms and doctor visits."
"Background
People with severe mental illness are twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes as those without severe mental illness. Treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes recommend that structured education should be integrated into routine care and should be offered to all. However, for people with severe mental illness, physical health may be a low priority, and motivation to change may be limited. These additional challenges mean that the findings reported in previous systematic reviews of diabetes self management interventions may not be generalised to those with severe mental illness, and that tailored approaches to effective diabetes education may be required for this population. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of diabetes self management interventions specifically tailored for people with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, ClinicalTrials.gov and grey literature. The date of the last search of all databases was 07 March 2016. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of diabetes self management interventions for people with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full‐text articles, extracted data and conducted the risk of bias assessment. We used a taxonomy of behaviour change techniques and the framework for behaviour change theory to describe the theoretical basis of the interventions and active ingredients. We used the GRADE method (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) to assess trials for overall quality of evidence. 
Main results
We included one randomised controlled trial involving 64 participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The average age of participants was 54 years; participants had been living with type 2 diabetes for on average nine years, and with their psychiatric diagnosis since they were on average 28 years of age. Investigators evaluated the 24‐week Diabetes Awareness and Rehabilitation Training (DART) programme in comparison with usual care plus information (UCI). Follow‐up after trial completion was six months. Risk of bias was mostly unclear but was high for selective reporting. Trial authors did not report on diabetes‐related complications, all‐cause mortality, adverse events, health‐related quality of life nor socioeconomic effects. Twelve months of data on self care behaviours as measured by total energy expenditure showed a mean of 2148 kcal for DART and 1496 kcal for UCI (52 participants; very low‐quality evidence), indicating no substantial improvement. The intervention did not have a substantial effect on glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 6 or 12 months of follow‐up (12‐month HbA1c data 7.9% for DART vs 6.9% for UCI; 52 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Researchers noted small improvements in body mass index immediately after the intervention was provided and at six months, along with improved weight post intervention. Diabetes knowledge and self efficacy improved immediately following receipt of the intervention, and knowledge also at six months. The intervention did not improve blood pressure. 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence is insufficient to show whether type 2 diabetes self management interventions for people with severe mental illness are effective in improving outcomes. Researchers must conduct additional trials to establish efficacy, and to identify the active ingredients in these interventions and the people most likely to benefit from them.","Self management interventions for type 2 diabetes in adults with severe mental illness
Review question 
What are the effects of diabetes self management interventions specifically tailored for adults with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness? 
Background 
Diabetes is one of the most common long‐term conditions, affecting around 415 million people worldwide. People with severe mental illness are twice as likely to develop diabetes as those without mental health problems because of many factors, including antipsychotic medication side effects and inadequate 'lifestyle' such as poor diet and low levels of physical activity. Once diagnosed, type 2 diabetes is managed through a combination of medication and behavioural changes. When diabetes is poorly managed, people can develop severe and life‐threatening complications. Healthcare providers have developed patient education programmes to help people to self manage their diabetes, and to reduce the likelihood of these complications. Although many programmes for type 2 diabetes have been found to be effective, little is known about programmes that have been specifically tailored to meet the needs of people with severe mental illness. 
Study characteristics 
We identified one study, which recruited 64 adults with type 2 diabetes and schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Researchers compared usual care plus information leaflets with a 24‐week education programme delivered once a week for 90 minutes (Diabetes Awareness and Rehabilitation Training). This programme provided basic diabetes education and information about nutrition and exercise. The average age of participants was 54 years; participants had been living with type 2 diabetes for on average nine years and with their psychiatric diagnosis since they were on average 28 years old. People in the included study were monitored for six months after the programme ended. 
This evidence is up to date as of 07 March 2016.
Key results 
In summary, few studies have evaluated the effects of diabetes self management programmes for adults with severe mental illness. Study authors of the single included study did not report diabetes‐related complications, all‐cause mortality, adverse events, health‐related quality of life nor socioeconomic effects. They described small improvements in body mass index and body weight, as well as in diabetes knowledge and self efficacy. Current evidence is insufficient to show that these types of programmes can help people with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness to better manage their diabetes and its consequences. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the overall quality of the evidence as very low, mainly because of the small numbers of included studies and participants, and because reported study results showed inconsistency.","# Plain Language Summary: Diabetes Education for People with Serious Mental Illness

## What is this study about?

People with serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia are twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes as other people. Doctors recommend that all people with diabetes should get education to help them manage their condition. However, people with serious mental illness may face extra challenges in learning about and managing their diabetes. This review looked at whether special diabetes education programs work for people who have both type 2 diabetes and serious mental illness.

## Who was studied?

The review found only one study to examine. That study included 64 people who had schizophrenia or a related condition and also had type 2 diabetes. The average age was 54 years old.

## What was tested?

Researchers compared a 24-week diabetes education program called DART (Diabetes Awareness and Rehabilitation Training) to usual care plus general information. They followed participants for 6 months after the program ended.

## What were the results?

The study looked at several things:

- **Activity levels**: The DART group and regular care group showed similar activity levels after 12 months.
- **Blood sugar control**: Both groups had similar blood sugar levels at 6 and 12 months.
- **Weight and body size**: The DART group had small improvements in weight right after the program and at 6 months.
- **Knowledge and confidence**: People in the DART group learned more about diabetes and felt more confident managing it right after the program. Knowledge improvements lasted at least 6 months.
- **Blood pressure**: The program did not improve blood pressure.

## What does this mean?

There is not enough evidence yet to say whether special diabetes education programs work well for people with serious mental illness. More research is needed to find out what works best for this group.","### Plain Language Summary

**Background**
People with severe mental illness often face more challenges and might be twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes compared to others. While everyone with type 2 diabetes should get special education as part of their care, those with severe mental illness might find it harder to focus on their physical health. Traditional methods might not work, so new ways to teach them how to manage their diabetes are needed.

**Objective**
The study wanted to find out if diabetes management programs specifically designed for individuals with both type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness are helpful.

**Method**
Researchers looked for studies in several medical databases, searching up to March 2016. They focused on studies where people were randomly assigned to different treatments to see what works best.

**Study Details**
Only one study fit their criteria. It involved 64 people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, who were around 54 years old on average. They had diabetes for about nine years and their mental health condition since they were about 28. The study compared a special program called Diabetes Awareness and Rehabilitation Training (DART) with regular care plus some information.

**Results**
- The study lasted 24 weeks, with a six-month follow-up.
- The quality of the study was mostly unclear, and some important information was missing.
- After the study, energy use, weight, and knowledge about diabetes showed small improvements.
- There was no significant change in long-term blood sugar control (HbA1c) or blood pressure.
- No information was provided about complications or overall health impact.

**Conclusion**
We don’t have enough evidence to say if these diabetes programs work well for people with severe mental illness. More research is needed to figure out what parts of the programs help the most and who benefits most from them."
"Background
High altitude illness (HAI) is a term used to describe a group of cerebral and pulmonary syndromes that can occur during travel to elevations above 2500 metres ( ˜ 8200 feet ). Acute hypoxia, acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude cerebral oedema (HACE) and high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) are reported as potential medical problems associated with high altitude. In this review, the first in a series of three about preventive strategies for HAI, we assess the effectiveness of six of the most recommended classes of pharmacological interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical effectiveness and adverse events of commonly‐used pharmacological interventions for preventing acute HAI. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), LILACS and trial registries in January 2017. We adapted the MEDLINE strategy for searching the other databases. We used a combination of thesaurus‐based and free‐text terms to search. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized‐controlled and cross‐over trials conducted in any setting where commonly‐used classes of drugs were used to prevent acute HAI. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 64 studies (78 references) and 4547 participants in this review, and classified 12 additional studies as ongoing. A further 12 studies await classification, as we were unable to obtain the full texts. Most of the studies were conducted in high altitude mountain areas, while the rest used low pressure (hypobaric) chambers to simulate altitude exposure. Twenty‐four trials provided the intervention between three and five days prior to the ascent, and 23 trials, between one and two days beforehand. Most of the included studies reached a final altitude of between 4001 and 5000 metres above sea level. Risks of bias were unclear for several domains, and a considerable number of studies did not report adverse events of the evaluated interventions. We found 26 comparisons, 15 of them comparing commonly‐used drugs versus placebo. We report results for the three most important comparisons: 
Acetazolamide versus placebo (28 parallel studies; 2345 participants) 
The risk of AMS was reduced with acetazolamide (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.56; I2 = 0%; 16 studies; 2301 participants; moderate quality of evidence). No events of HAPE were reported and only one event of HACE (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.48; 6 parallel studies; 1126 participants; moderate quality of evidence). Few studies reported side effects for this comparison, and they showed an increase in the risk of paraesthesia with the intake of acetazolamide (RR 5.53, 95% CI 2.81 to 10.88, I2 = 60%; 5 studies, 789 participants; low quality of evidence). 
Budenoside versus placebo (2 parallel studies; 132 participants) 
Data on budenoside showed a reduction in the incidence of AMS compared with placebo (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.61; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 132 participants; low quality of evidence). Studies included did not report events of HAPE or HACE, and they did not find side effects (low quality of evidence). 
Dexamethasone versus placebo (7 parallel studies; 205 participants) 
For dexamethasone, the data did not show benefits at any dosage (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.00; I2 = 39%; 4 trials, 176 participants; low quality of evidence). Included studies did not report events of HAPE or HACE, and we rated the evidence about adverse events as of very low quality. 
Authors' conclusions
Our assessment of the most commonly‐used pharmacological interventions suggests that acetazolamide is an effective pharmacological agent to prevent acute HAI in dosages of 250 to 750 mg/day. This information is based on evidence of moderate quality. Acetazolamide is associated with an increased risk of paraesthesia, although there are few reports about other adverse events from the available evidence. The clinical benefits and harms of other pharmacological interventions such as ibuprofen, budenoside and dexamethasone are unclear. Large multicentre studies are needed for most of the pharmacological agents evaluated in this review, to evaluate their effectiveness and safety.","Drugs commonly‐used for preventing high altitude illness
Background 
High altitude illness (HAI) is a term used to describe a group of brain and breathing conditions that can occur while travelling to altitudes above 2500 metres ( ˜ 8200 feet ). HAI is generally characterized by headache, nausea, vomiting and tiredness (often called acute mountain sickness), but may affect the brain or the lungs in different individuals. In this review, we assessed the most commonly‐used drugs to prevent the onset of this illness. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to January 2017. We included 64 studies related to six different types of drugs recommended for HAI prevention. Most of the studies were conducted in high altitude mountain areas, while the rest used low pressure (hypobaric) chambers to simulate altitude exposure. The participants' ages ranged between 16 and 65 years. Eleven studies included people at a high risk of this condition due to their history of HAI or other illnesses such as asthma. Twenty‐four trials provided the intervention between three and five days prior to the ascent, and 23 trials, between one and two days beforehand. Most of the included studies reached a final altitude of between 4001 and 5000 metres above sea level. In 23 of the included studies, the source of funding was unclear. Only 18 studies declared their possible conflicts of interests. We classed 24 more studies as still ongoing or waiting for assessment. 
Key results 
Our findings suggest that acetazolamide is an effective treatment for the prevention of acute HAI in dosages of 250 to 750 mg/day, when this drug is compared to a placebo (i.e. a pill with no active agent). Most of the available information relates to the prevention of uncomplicated HAI (headache, nausea, vomiting and tiredness) rather than to more serious brain or lung problems. We also found that acetazolamide is associated with an increased risk of paraesthesia in the fingers (i.e. a sensation of tingling, tickling, pricking, or burning of the skin), although this outcome is not well reported in the available evidence. The benefits and harms of other drugs such as ibuprofen, budenoside and dexamethasone are unclear, due to the small number of studies. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the evidence as moderate to very low. Several studies had quality shortcomings, including their use of small numbers of participants and a lack of reporting of important outcomes such as side effects. For most of the drugs covered by the studies, additional research is required to clarify their effectiveness and safety.","# Plain Language Summary: Medicines to Prevent High Altitude Illness

## What is this study about?

This study looked at medicines that might help prevent high altitude illness. High altitude illness happens when people travel to very high elevations (above 8,200 feet) where there is less oxygen in the air. The illness can cause headaches, swelling in the brain, or fluid in the lungs.

## Who was studied?

The researchers looked at 64 different studies that included 4,547 people total. Most studies took place in high mountain areas, though some used special chambers that simulate high altitude. Most people in the studies climbed to elevations between 13,100 and 16,400 feet.

## What did they test?

The researchers tested six types of medicines that doctors commonly recommend to prevent high altitude illness. They focused on three main medicines:

- **Acetazolamide** (a water pill)
- **Budenoside** (a steroid spray)
- **Dexamethasone** (a steroid medicine)

## What did they find?

**Acetazolamide worked best.** It reduced the chance of getting high altitude illness by about half compared to a fake pill. However, it caused tingling and numbness in fingers, toes, and lips in some people.

**Budenoside showed promise** but was only tested in 2 small studies, so researchers need more information.

**Dexamethasone did not clearly help** prevent high altitude illness.

## Bottom line

Acetazolamide is the most effective medicine tested, but researchers say more large studies are needed to better understand all these medicines and their side effects.","### Plain Language Summary: Preventing Sickness at High Altitudes

**Background**
When people travel to places higher than 8,200 feet, they might get sick because of the thin air. This can affect the brain and lungs. We're looking into medicines that might help prevent this sickness.

**Objective**
To see how well some medicines work to stop people from getting sick at high altitudes and check if they have any bad side effects.

**How We Researched**
We looked at many scientific studies up to January 2017. We searched for tests where people took these medicines before going to high places.

**What We Found**
We reviewed 64 studies with 4,547 people. These studies were done mostly in high mountains or special low-pressure rooms that mimic high-altitude conditions. People took medicines either a few days before or right before going up high.

**Key Comparisons**

1. **Acetazolamide vs. Placebo**
    - This medicine reduced the risk of altitude sickness compared to a fake pill (placebo).
    - No lung issues were reported and only one brain issue was noticed.
    - A side effect was tingling feelings in some people.

2. **Budenoside vs. Placebo**
    - Showed some reduction in altitude sickness.
    - No serious side effects were found.

3. **Dexamethasone vs. Placebo**
    - Did not show clear benefits.
    - No serious side effects reported either.

**Conclusions**
Acetazolamide seems to help prevent altitude sickness and is usually taken in doses of 250 to 750 mg a day. It might cause some tingling feelings. For other medicines like ibuprofen, budenoside, and dexamethasone, we need more research to see if they work well and are safe."
"Background
Cataract and age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) are common causes of decreased vision that often occur simultaneously in people over age 50. Although cataract surgery is an effective treatment for cataract‐induced visual loss, some clinicians suspect that such an intervention may increase the risk of worsening of underlying AMD and thus have deleterious effects on vision. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of cataract surgery compared with no surgery in eyes with AMD. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 11), Ovid MEDLINE, Epub Ahead of Print, In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily (January 1946 to December 2016), Embase (January 1980 to December 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to December 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 2 December 2016. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomized trials that enrolled participants whose eyes were affected by both cataract and AMD in which cataract surgery was compared with no surgery. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently evaluated the search results against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias for included studies, and graded the certainty of evidence. We followed methods as recommended by Cochrane. 
Main results
We included two RCTs with a total of 114 participants (114 study eyes) with visually significant cataract and AMD. We identified no ongoing trials. Participants in each RCT were randomized to immediate cataract surgery (within two weeks of enrollment) or delayed cataract surgery (six months after enrollment). The risk of bias was unclear for most domains in each study; one study was registered prospectively. 
In one study conducted in Australia outcomes were reported only at six months (before participants in the delayed‐surgery group had cataract surgery). At six months, the immediate‐surgery group showed mean improvement in best‐corrected visual acuity (BCVA) compared with the delayed‐surgery group (mean difference (MD) ‐0.15 LogMAR, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.28 to ‐0.02; 56 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). In the other study, conducted in Austria, outcomes were reported only at 12 months (12 months after participants in the immediate‐surgery group and six months after participants in the delayed‐surgery group had cataract surgery). There was uncertainty as to which treatment group had better improvement in distance visual acuity at 12 months (unit of measure not reported; very low‐certainty evidence). 
At 12 months, the mean change from baseline between groups in cumulated drusen or geographic atrophy area size was small and there was uncertainty which, if either, of the groups was favored (MD 0.76, 95% CI ‐8.49 to 10.00; 49 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No participant in one study had exudative AMD develop in the study eye during 12 months of follow‐up; in the other study, choroidal neovascularization developed in the study eye of 1 of 27 participants in the immediate‐surgery group versus 0 of 29 participants in the delayed‐surgery group at six months (risk ratio 3.21, 95% CI 0.14 to 75.68; 56 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Quality of life was measured using two different questionnaires. Scores on the Impact of Vision Impairment (IVI) questionnaire suggested that the immediate‐surgery group fared better regarding vision‐related quality of life than the delayed‐surgery group at six months (MD in IVI logit scores 1.60, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.59; low‐certainty evidence). However, we could not analyze scores from the Visual Function‐14 (VF‐14) questionnaire from the other study due to insufficient data. No postoperative complication was reported from either study. 
Authors' conclusions
At this time, it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions from the available data as to whether cataract surgery is beneficial or harmful in people with AMD after 12 months. Although cataract surgery provides short‐term (six months) improvement in BCVA in eyes with AMD compared with no surgery, it is unclear whether the timing of surgery has an effect on long‐term outcomes. Physicians must make recommendations to their AMD patients regarding cataract surgery based on experience and clinical judgment until large controlled trials are conducted and their findings published. 
There is a need for prospective RCTs in which cataract surgery is compared with no surgery in people with AMD to better evaluate whether cataract surgery is beneficial or harmful in all or a subset of AMD patients. However, ethical considerations preclude withholding surgery, or delaying it for several years, if it may be a potentially beneficial treatment. Designers of future trials are encouraged to utilize existing standardized systems for grading cataract and AMD and for measuring key outcomes: visual acuity, change in visual acuity, worsening of AMD, quality of life measures, and adverse events.","Cataract surgery in people with age‐related macular degeneration
What is the aim of this review?  The aim of this Cochrane Review was to determine whether cataract surgery is safe and improves vision in eyes with age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) compared with no surgery. Cochrane researchers collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question and included two studies. 
Key messages  Although data from two small studies suggest that surgery to remove cataracts in eyes with AMD may improve vision without worsening of AMD, it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions from the available data at this time. Physicians must decide whether to recommend cataract surgery to their AMD patients based on clinical judgment until larger studies have been conducted and their findings published. 
What was studied in this review?  Both cataract and AMD are common causes of poor vision; they often occur together in people over age 50. Cataract occurs when the clear lens in the front of the eye becomes cloudy. Removing the cloudy lens (cataract surgery) restores good vision for many eyes that do not have other eye conditions. AMD is disease in which the macula (the area in the back of the eye that is responsible for central vision) deteriorates. Some physicians believe that cataract surgery may put eyes that have AMD at higher risk of more vision loss than leaving the cloudy lens in the eye. 
What are the main results of this review?  This review included two studies comparing immediate cataract surgery (within two weeks) with delayed cataract surgery (at six months) for people who had both cataract and AMD. In one study, the group that received immediate surgery had better vision at six months than the group scheduled for delayed surgery. In the other study, it was unclear which group had better vision improvements at 12 months. No participant in one study had the AMD get worse; AMD got worse in only one person in the immediate‐surgery group in the other study. Two studies measured quality of life: one study suggested that the immediate‐surgery group had a better quality of life than the delayed‐surgery group, and the second study did not report enough information to allow us to analyze the data. Neither study reported adverse events. 
How up‐to‐date is the review?  Cochrane researchers searched for studies that had been published up to 2 December 2016.","# Plain Language Summary: Cataract Surgery in People with Age-Related Macular Degeneration

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether cataract surgery is safe and helpful for people who have both cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD)—two common eye conditions that affect older adults. Some doctors worry that cataract surgery might make AMD worse, so researchers wanted to find out if that's true.

## Who was studied?

The review included two research studies with a total of 114 people who had both cataracts and AMD. In both studies, some people had cataract surgery right away, while others waited six months before having surgery.

## What did they find?

**Short-term results (6 months):**
- People who had surgery right away saw better improvement in their vision compared to those who waited.

**Long-term results (12 months):**
- It was unclear which group had better vision results.
- The AMD did not get noticeably worse in either group.
- Very few serious eye problems developed in either group during the study.
- People who had surgery right away reported better quality of life related to their vision.
- No serious surgery complications were reported.

## Main takeaway

Cataract surgery appears to help vision in the short term for people with AMD, but researchers don't have enough information yet to say whether it's better or worse in the long run. Doctors should talk with their patients about the benefits and risks based on what they know from their experience.

## What's next?

More research is needed to give clearer answers about cataract surgery in AMD patients.","### Plain Language Summary: Cataract Surgery and Eye Health

#### What was studied?
This study looked at whether cataract surgery affects people with both cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Both conditions can make it harder to see, especially for people over 50. 

#### What was the purpose?
The goal was to find out if cataract surgery is safe and helpful for people with AMD compared to not having the surgery.

#### How was it researched?
Researchers looked at previous studies where people with both cataracts and AMD either had immediate cataract surgery or delayed surgery. They compared the vision changes in these groups. 

#### Who participated?
The study involved 114 people who had both cataracts and AMD.

#### What did the researchers find?
1. **Short-term Vision Improvement:** People who had cataract surgery right away showed better vision after six months compared to those who waited.
2. **Long-term Vision Uncertainty:** After a year, it wasn't clear if having surgery sooner or later was better for vision.
3. **AMD Changes:** There wasn't enough clear evidence if cataract surgery worsens AMD or not.
4. **Quality of Life:** Early surgery seemed to improve the quality of life related to vision in the short term.
5. **Safety:** No serious problems were found from the surgery in the studies.

#### What conclusions were made?
It's still unclear whether cataract surgery helps or harms eyes with AMD in the long run. More large studies are needed to give better answers. Doctors need to make decisions based on their experiences until more information is available.

#### What should future studies do?
Future research should carefully plan how to measure changes in vision, the impact on AMD, and check for any problems after surgery. They should use standard methods to make sure results are reliable."
"Background
Neuropathic pain is thought to arise from damage to the somatosensory nervous system. Its prevalence is increasing in line with many chronic disorders such as diabetes. All treatments have limited effectiveness. Given the evidence regarding psychological treatment for distress and disability in people with various chronic pain conditions, we were interested to investigate whether psychological treatments have any effects for those with chronic neuropathic pain. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of psychological treatments on pain experience, disability, mood, and health‐care use in adults with chronic neuropathic pain. 
Search methods
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in any language in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO, from database inception to March 2015. 
Selection criteria
Full publications of RCTs on psychological interventions for neuropathic pain. Trials had to have lasted at least three months, had at least 20 participants in each arm at the end of treatment, and compared a psychological intervention with any active or inactive intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
Two small studies (enrolling a total of 105 participants) met the inclusion criteria. One was a standard cognitive behavioural treatment (CBT) programme for 61 people with pain from spinal cord injury, followed up for three months, and compared with a waiting list. The other was weekly group psychotherapy for 44 people with burning mouth syndrome, compared with a daily placebo tablet. The overall risk of bias was high in both trials. 
The CBT study assessed participants for pain, disability, mood, and quality of life, with improvement in treatment and control groups. However, there was no more improvement in the treatment group than in the control for any outcome, either post‐treatment or at follow‐up. The group psychotherapy study only assessed pain, classifying participants by pain severity. There is a lack of evidence on the efficacy and safety of psychological interventions for people with neuropathic pain. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence of the efficacy and safety of psychological interventions for chronic neuropathic pain. The two available studies show no benefit of treatment over either waiting list or placebo control groups.","Psychological treatments for chronic pain involving damage or disease to nerves responsible for pain 
Many people experience pain from an injury or disease that goes away within three months, but for some people the pain continues. When the pain involves changes to nerves we call the pain 'neuropathic'. Although the condition is increasingly common, the treatments we have help only a few people. Following unsuccessful surgical or pharmacological treatment, people with chronic pain may be offered psychologically‐based rehabilitation to improve their quality of life. While we know that this can help people with other types of chronic pain, this treatment for neuropathic pain alone has received less research attention. 
In this review, we were interested in finding out whether psychological treatments improve pain, distress, and disability in people with chronic neuropathic pain. We searched the academic literature to March 2015 and identified two randomised controlled trials (the gold standard design for clinical trials) on psychological interventions for chronic neuropathic pain. The two studies included 105 participants: one trial of 61 people with pain from spinal cord injury and the other of 44 people with burning mouth syndrome. 
Our confidence in the results of the individual trials was limited by several potential biases in how they were conducted. We were not able to analyse the results of the two trials together because the experiences of people with spinal cord injury or burning mouth are too different from each other. On their own, the trials were too small for us to undertake any statistical analysis. However, neither trial found any clear benefit of treatment. We conclude that there is currently no evidence that will help practitioners and patients to decide whether to use these treatments. We discuss what studies are needed.","# Plain Language Summary: Psychological Treatments for Nerve Pain

## What is this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if talking therapies (like counseling) could help people with chronic nerve pain feel better. Nerve pain happens when the nerves that carry pain signals get damaged. This type of pain is becoming more common, especially in people with diabetes.

## Why does this matter?

Current medicines for nerve pain don't work very well for most people. Scientists thought that psychological treatments—which help people cope with stress and disability from other chronic pain conditions—might also help with nerve pain.

## What did researchers do?

The researchers looked for studies that tested psychological treatments for nerve pain. They searched medical databases from the beginning through March 2015. They were looking for studies that:
- Lasted at least 3 months
- Had at least 20 people in each group at the end
- Compared a psychological treatment to another type of treatment or placebo

## What did they find?

Only 2 small studies met the requirements, with a total of 105 people:

1. **First study**: 61 people with pain from spinal cord injury received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT—a type of talk therapy) or waited on a waiting list. They were checked 3 months later.

2. **Second study**: 44 people with burning mouth syndrome attended group therapy sessions weekly or took a placebo pill daily.

**Results**: Neither treatment worked better than the comparison groups. Both groups improved somewhat, but the psychological treatment didn't help more than doing nothing or taking a placebo.

## Bottom line

There isn't enough evidence yet to know if psychological treatments help people with chronic nerve pain. More research is needed.","### Plain Language Summary

#### What Was the Study About?
This study looked at whether psychological treatments could help adults who have long-lasting nerve pain.

#### Why Is This Important?
Nerve pain can be hard to treat, and many people who have it, like those with diabetes, don’t find much relief with current treatments. We wanted to see if talking therapies could make a difference in how people feel and cope with their pain.

#### What Did Researchers Do?
- They looked at past studies from different databases up to March 2015.
- They focused on studies that included adults with nerve pain who received some form of psychological treatment.
- Each study needed to have at least 20 people in each group (treatment and comparison) and last at least three months.

#### What Did They Find?
- Only two small studies fit the criteria, involving 105 people in total.
- One study tested how well cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helped people with spinal cord injury pain. It compared those who had CBT with those on a waiting list for three months.
- The other study tested group therapy for people with burning mouth syndrome, comparing it to a fake pill.

#### What Were the Results?
- In both studies, there wasn’t much difference in improvement between those who got the psychological treatment and those who did not.
- Both studies had a high chance of errors, making the results less reliable.

#### Conclusion
Right now, there’s not enough evidence to prove that psychological treatments work or are safe for people with long-lasting nerve pain. More research is needed to better understand if these treatments can help."
"Background
A large proportion of people with advanced cancer will experience moderate to severe pain. Tapentadol is a novel, centrally acting analgesic medicine acting at the μ‐opioid receptor and inhibiting noradrenaline reuptake. The efficacy of tapentadol is stated to be comparable to morphine and oxycodone. 
Objectives
To assess the analgesic efficacy of tapentadol for the relief of cancer pain in adults, and the adverse events associated with its use in clinical trials. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE from January 2005 to July 2015, together with reference lists of retrieved papers and review articles, and two clinical trial registries. Searches started from 2005 because this covered the period during which clinical trials were conducted. We contacted the manufacturer of tapentadol in the UK to find additional trials not identified by electronic searches. We did not restrict searches by language. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of tapentadol compared with placebo or active controls in adults with moderate to severe cancer pain. Pain had to be measured using a validated assessment tool, and studies had to include at least 10 participants per treatment arm. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data using a standard form and assessed risk of bias. We extracted available data on study design, participant details, interventions, and outcomes, including analgesic outcome measures, withdrawals, and adverse events. 
Main results
We included four studies with 1029 participants. All the studies used a parallel‐group design, and included an initial titration phase to determine the maximum effective and tolerated dose, followed by a maintenance phase. Tapentadol medication was taken twice daily and doses ranged from 50 to 500 mg per day. Rescue medication (morphine or oxycodone immediate‐release) was available to participants in all studies. 
Overall, 440 participants were randomised in classically designed RCTs, and 589 participants were enrolled in enriched‐enrolment, randomised‐withdrawal (EERW) trials. A total of 476 participants were randomised to titration with tapentadol and 338 participants took tapentadol throughout the maintenance phase of their trial. 
All studies used numerical rating scores, Patient Global Impression of Change scores, and use of rescue medication as measures of efficacy, and all reported on adverse events and withdrawals. 
All studies enrolled fewer than 200 participants per treatment arm and were therefore at risk of overestimating efficacy. One study was terminated early due to problems with supply of rescue medication, with fewer than 20 participants enrolled per treatment arm in the maintenance phase of the trial. We judged another study at high risk of bias due to an open‐label design. 
There were insufficient data for pooling and statistical analysis. Response rates for pain intensity were comparable across treatment groups in each study. In one EERW study, response rates were high across both treatment and placebo arms during the maintenance phase (62% tapentadol, 69% morphine, 50% placebo). For pain relief, tapentadol is no more and no less effective than oxycodone or morphine (low quality evidence). 
Treatment emergent adverse event rates were high, approximately 50% to 90%. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, constipation) (low quality evidence). There was no advantage of tapentadol over morphine or oxycodone in terms of serious adverse events. The number of people experiencing effects on consciousness, appetite, or thirst was low. 
Authors' conclusions
Information from RCTs on the effectiveness and tolerability of tapentadol was limited. The available studies were of moderate or small size and used different designs, which prevented pooling of data. Pain relief and adverse events were comparable between the tapentadol and morphine and oxycodone groups.","Oral tapentadol for cancer pain
Tapentadol taken by mouth produced good pain relief for people with moderate to severe cancer pain, similar to morphine or oxycodone. 
One person in two or three who gets cancer will experience moderate to severe pain. As the cancer advances, the pain may get worse. Morphine has been used since the 1950s for controlling cancer pain. Since then, a number of medications with morphine‐like actions have been developed for controlling pain, one of which is tapentadol. Tapentadol has been studied in clinical trials since 2005, but has only been used in the UK since 2011. It is available in tablets of different strengths, and is normally taken twice a day. In this review, we set out to estimate how well tapentadol worked and how many people had side effects, including serious effects or those that stopped people from taking the medication. 
We searched medical databases for clinical trials in adults with moderate to severe cancer pain that compared tapentadol with placebo (dummy medicine) or other pain‐relieving medicines, and measured pain using recognised assessment methods. 
We found four studies with 1029 participants. All four studies compared participants taking tapentadol to participants taking similar medicine, such as morphine or oxycodone. All studies gave participants a period of time to find the best dose to take, before continuing on the medication and comparing their pain levels. 
All the studies were small or medium sized, so the results are at risk of being influenced by random fluctuations rather than real differences, and they may also overestimate any effects. One trial allowed participants to know what medication they were taking, and one trial was stopped early due administrative problems, so they did not have enough people in the study. We have to be cautious interpreting results from these studies. 
Because the studies all used different designs, we could not compare the results from one with another. However, each study showed that there was not much difference between the pain levels of people taking tapentadol and people taking morphine and oxycodone. Pain levels were generally well controlled. The studies also showed there was no measurable difference in how many adverse effects people had while taking tapentadol, morphine, or oxycodone. 
Therefore, we can conclude only that the studies to date show tapentadol was no more or less effective and no more or less well tolerated than morphine and oxycodone.","# Plain Language Summary: Tapentadol for Cancer Pain

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether a pain medicine called tapentadol works well for adults with advanced cancer who have moderate to severe pain. Researchers wanted to know if tapentadol is as good as other common pain medicines and what side effects it causes.

## Who was studied?

The review included four research studies with a total of 1,029 adults who had moderate to severe cancer pain.

## What was tested?

Researchers compared tapentadol to other pain medicines (morphine and oxycodone) and to placebo (a fake medicine with no active ingredient). Participants took their medicine twice a day. Doses ranged from 50 to 500 mg per day. Everyone could also get extra rescue medicine if their pain wasn't controlled.

## How long did the studies last?

The studies had two phases:
- **Titration phase**: Finding the right dose for each person
- **Maintenance phase**: Keeping people on their best dose

## What were the results?

**Pain relief:** Tapentadol worked about the same as morphine and oxycodone. It was no better and no worse.

**Side effects:** Between 50% to 90% of people had side effects. The most common ones were stomach problems like nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Tapentadol had similar side effects compared to morphine and oxycodone. Serious side effects were rare in all groups.

## Important limitations

The studies were small and used different designs, making it hard to combine the results. More research is needed to fully understand how well tapentadol works.","### Plain Language Summary

#### Purpose of the Study
The study looked at how well a medicine called tapentadol works for relieving pain in adults with advanced cancer. It also checked for any side effects from using tapentadol.

#### Who Was Involved
The study included adults with cancer pain that was moderate to severe. There were four studies with a total of 1,029 participants.

#### What Was Done
Participants received tapentadol, a different pain medicine, or a placebo (a pill with no medicine). Tapentadol doses ranged from 50 to 500 mg twice a day. If the pain wasn’t controlled, patients could take extra medicine like morphine or oxycodone.

#### How the Study Was Done
Researchers measured pain relief by asking patients to rate their pain and say how much better they felt overall. They also noted any side effects or if anyone stopped taking the medicine because of problems.

#### Main Findings
- **Pain Relief:** Tapentadol worked about the same as morphine and oxycodone for relieving pain. 
- **Side Effects:** Many people (50% to 90%) had side effects like nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Serious side effects were similar for all medicines.
- One study had fewer people than planned because of medication supply issues.

#### Conclusion
The study found that tapentadol is similar in effectiveness to morphine and oxycodone for cancer pain relief, but both have similar risks of side effects. The available studies were small, so results should be interpreted with caution."
"Background
Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a distressing condition, which is often treated with psychological therapies. Earlier versions of this review, and other meta‐analyses, have found these to be effective, with trauma‐focused treatments being more effective than non‐trauma‐focused treatments. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005 and updated in 2007. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of psychological therapies for the treatment of adults with chronic post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
Search methods
For this update, we searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References) all years to 12th April 2013. This register contains relevant randomised controlled trials from: The Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). In addition, we handsearched the Journal of Traumatic Stress, contacted experts in the field, searched bibliographies of included studies, and performed citation searches of identified articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of individual trauma‐focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TFCBT), eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR), non‐trauma‐focused CBT (non‐TFCBT), other therapies (supportive therapy, non‐directive counselling, psychodynamic therapy and present‐centred therapy), group TFCBT, or group non‐TFCBT, compared to one another or to a waitlist or usual care group for the treatment of chronic PTSD. The primary outcome measure was the severity of clinician‐rated traumatic‐stress symptoms. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data and entered them into Review Manager 5 software. We contacted authors to obtain missing data. Two review authors independently performed 'Risk of bias' assessments. We pooled the data where appropriate, and analysed for summary effects. 
Main results
We include 70 studies involving a total of 4761 participants in the review. The first primary outcome for this review was reduction in the severity of PTSD symptoms, using a standardised measure rated by a clinician. For this outcome, individual TFCBT and EMDR were more effective than waitlist/usual care (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐1.62; 95% CI ‐2.03 to ‐1.21; 28 studies; n = 1256 and SMD ‐1.17; 95% CI ‐2.04 to ‐0.30; 6 studies; n = 183 respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between individual TFCBT, EMDR and Stress Management (SM) immediately post‐treatment although there was some evidence that individual TFCBT and EMDR were superior to non‐TFCBT at follow‐up, and that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non‐TFCBT were more effective than other therapies. Non‐TFCBT was more effective than waitlist/usual care and other therapies. Other therapies were superior to waitlist/usual care control as was group TFCBT. There was some evidence of greater drop‐out (the second primary outcome for this review) in active treatment groups. Many of the studies were rated as being at 'high' or 'unclear' risk of bias in multiple domains, and there was considerable unexplained heterogeneity; in addition, we assessed the quality of the evidence for each comparison as very low. As such, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence for each of the comparisons made in this review was assessed as very low quality. This evidence showed that individual TFCBT and EMDR did better than waitlist/usual care in reducing clinician‐assessed PTSD symptoms. There was evidence that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non‐TFCBT are equally effective immediately post‐treatment in the treatment of PTSD. There was some evidence that TFCBT and EMDR are superior to non‐TFCBT between one to four months following treatment, and also that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non‐TFCBT are more effective than other therapies. There was evidence of greater drop‐out in active treatment groups. Although a substantial number of studies were included in the review, the conclusions are compromised by methodological issues evident in some. Sample sizes were small, and it is apparent that many of the studies were underpowered. There were limited follow‐up data, which compromises conclusions regarding the long‐term effects of psychological treatment.","Psychological therapies for chronic post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults
Background: Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can occur following a traumatic event. It is characterised by symptoms of re‐experiencing the trauma (in the form of nightmares, flashbacks and distressing thoughts), avoiding reminders of the traumatic event, negative alterations in thoughts and mood, and symptoms of hyper‐arousal (feeling on edge, being easily startled, feeling angry, having difficulties sleeping, and problems concentrating). 
Previous reviews have supported the use of individual trauma‐focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TFCBT) and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) in the treatment of PTSD. TFCBT is a variant of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which includes a number of techniques to help a person overcome a traumatic event. It is a combination of cognitive therapy aimed at changing the way a person thinks, and behavioural therapy, which aims to change the way a person acts. TFCBT helps an individual come to terms with a trauma through exposure to memories of the event. EMDR is a psychological therapy, which aims to help a person reprocess their memories of a traumatic event. The therapy involves bringing distressing trauma‐related images, beliefs, and bodily sensations to mind, whilst the therapist guides eye movements from side to side. More positive views of the trauma memories are identified, with the aim of replacing the ones that are causing problems. 
TFCBT and EMDR are currently recommended as the treatments of choice by guidelines such as those published by the United Kingdom's National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). 
Study characteristics: This review draws together up‐to‐date evidence from 70 studies including a total of 4761 people. 
Key findings: There is continued support for the efficacy of individual TFCBT, EMDR, non‐TFCBT and group TFCBT in the treatment of chronic PTSD in adults. Other non‐trauma‐focused psychological therapies did not reduce PTSD symptoms as significantly. There was evidence that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non‐TFCBT are equally effective immediately post‐treatment in the treatment of PTSD. There was some evidence that TFCBT and EMDR are superior to non‐TFCBT between one to four months following treatment, and also that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non‐TFCBT are more effective than other therapies. No specific conflicts of interest were identified. 
Quality of the evidence: Although we included a substantial number of studies in this review, each only included small numbers of people and some were poorly designed. We assessed the overall quality of the studies as very low and so the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. There is insufficient evidence to show whether or not psychological therapy is harmful.","# Plain Language Summary: Psychological Therapies for PTSD

## What is this study about?

This review looked at different types of talk therapy (psychological treatments) used to help adults with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a serious condition that can develop after someone experiences a traumatic event. Researchers wanted to find out which types of therapy work best.

## What did researchers do?

Scientists searched for studies comparing different therapies. They looked at 70 different studies involving 4,761 people total. They compared several types of therapy:
- Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TFCBT)
- Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)
- Other types of therapy that don't focus on the trauma
- Supportive counseling and other approaches

## What did they find?

**Main results:**
- TFCBT and EMDR worked better than no treatment (waiting list or regular care)
- Right after treatment ended, TFCBT, EMDR, and other therapies worked about equally well
- Several months after treatment, TFCBT and EMDR seemed to work better than other types of therapy
- More people quit the active treatment groups than expected

## Important limitations

The researchers noted that:
- The quality of evidence was very low
- Many studies had small numbers of participants
- There wasn't much information about how long the benefits lasted
- The studies had various problems with how they were designed

## Bottom line

While TFCBT and EMDR showed promise compared to no treatment, the researchers say these findings should be interpreted carefully due to study quality issues.","**Plain Language Summary**

**What Was Studied?**

This study looked at how well different psychological therapies help adults with long-lasting stress after a traumatic event, called PTSD. 

**Study Goals**

The goal was to find out how effective these therapies are in reducing PTSD symptoms.

**How Was the Study Done?**

- Researchers collected information from many studies up to April 12, 2013.
- They searched several medical databases and asked experts for their input.
- They looked at studies where people were randomly assigned to different therapy groups.

**Who Was Involved?**

The study included 70 different studies with a total of 4,761 people.

**What Did They Find?**

1. **Effective Therapies**: Individual trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TFCBT) and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) were better than doing nothing or usual care in reducing PTSD symptoms.

2. **Comparisons**: 
   - Both TFCBT and EMDR worked right after treatment.
   - TFCBT and EMDR were slightly better than other types of non-trauma-focused CBT later on.
   - Group TFCBT was also better than just waiting or usual care.

3. **Dropouts**: More people stopped participating in active therapy groups compared to those on waitlists or usual care.

**Research Quality**

The overall quality of the evidence was considered very low, so the findings should be viewed with caution.

**Conclusion**

This study suggests that certain therapies like TFCBT and EMDR can help reduce PTSD symptoms, but because of some problems in the studies, these results aren't completely reliable. More research is needed to better understand these therapies' long-term effects."
"Background
Raised intraocular pressure is a risk factor for glaucoma. One treatment option is glaucoma drainage surgery (trabeculectomy). Antimetabolites are used during surgery to reduce postoperative scarring during wound healing. Two agents in common use are mitomycin C (MMC) and 5‐Fluorouracil (5‐FU). 
Objectives
To assess the effects of MMC compared to 5‐FU as an antimetabolite adjunct in trabeculectomy surgery. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2015 Issue 9), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to October 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to October 2015), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 2 October 2015. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials where wound healing had been modified with MMC compared to 5‐FU. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials and collected data. The primary outcome was failure of a functioning trabeculectomy one year after surgery. Secondary outcomes included mean intraocular pressure at one year. We considered three subgroups: high risk of trabeculectomy failure (people with previous glaucoma surgery, extracapsular cataract surgery, African origin and people with secondary glaucoma or congenital glaucoma); medium risk of trabeculectomy failure (people undergoing trabeculectomy with extracapsular cataract surgery) and low risk of trabeculectomy failure (people who have received no previous surgical eye intervention). 
Main results
We identified 11 trials that enrolled 687 eyes of 679 participants. The studies were conducted in the United States, Europe, Asia and Africa. Five studies enrolled participants at low risk of trabeculectomy failure, five studies enrolled participants at high risk of failure, and one study enrolled people with both high and low risk of failure. None of the included trials enrolled participants with combined trabeculectomy/cataract surgery. 
We considered one study to be at low risk of bias in all domains, six studies to be at high risk of bias in one or more domains, and the remaining four studies to be at an unclear risk of bias in all domains. 
The risk of failure of trabeculectomy at one year after surgery was less in those participants who received MMC compared to those who received 5‐FU, however the confidence intervals were wide and are compatible with no effect (risk ratio (RR) 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 1.00; studies = 11; I2 = 40%). There was no evidence for any difference between groups at high and low risk of failure (test for subgroup differences P = 0.69). 
On average, people treated with MMC had lower intraocular pressure at one year (mean difference (MD) ‐3.05 mmHg, 95% CI ‐4.60 to ‐1.50), but the studies were inconsistent (I2 = 52%). The size of the effect was greater in the high‐risk group (MD ‐4.18 mmHg, 95% CI ‐6.73 to ‐1.64) compared to the low‐risk group (MD ‐1.72 mmHg, 95% CI ‐3.28 to ‐0.16), but again the test for interaction was not statistically significant (P = 0.11). 
Similar proportions of eyes treated with MMC lost 2 or more lines of visual acuity one year after surgery compared to 5‐FU, but the confidence intervals were wide (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.06). 
Adverse events occurred relatively rarely, and estimates of effect were generally imprecise. There was some evidence for less epitheliopathy in the MMC group (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.47) and less hyphaema in the MMC group (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.91). 
None of the studies reported quality of life.
Overall, we graded the quality of the evidence as low largely because of risk of bias in the included studies and imprecision in the estimate of effect. 
Authors' conclusions
We found low‐quality evidence that MMC may be more effective in achieving long‐term lower intraocular pressure than 5‐FU. Further comparative research on MMC and 5‐FU is needed to enhance reliability and validity of the results shown in this review. Furthermore, the development of new agents that control postoperative scar tissue formation without side effects would be valuable and is justified by the results of this review.","Mitomycin C versus 5‐Fluorouracil for wound healing in glaucoma surgery
Review question  Does mitomycin C (MMC) offer any advantage in comparison to 5‐Fluorouracil (5‐FU) as the antimetabolite used to augment glaucoma surgery (trabeculectomy)? Does MMC help to achieve lower rates of trabeculectomy failure than 5‐FU at one year postoperatively? 
Background  Raised intraocular pressure is a risk factor for glaucoma. One treatment option is glaucoma drainage surgery (trabeculectomy) to help lower intraocular pressure. Antimetabolites are medicines used during surgery to help reduce scarring after surgery during wound healing. If scarring occurs it can lead to treatment failure because the drainage channel no longer works. Two agents in common use are MMC and 5‐FU. 
Search date  The evidence is up to date to October 2015. 
Study characteristics  We included 11 randomised controlled trials conducted in the United States, Europe, Asia and Africa in this review. In total, 687 eyes of 679 participants underwent routine trabeculectomy for glaucoma control. Some participants were at a higher risk of failure than others, for example if they had had previous glaucoma surgery, were of African origin, or if they had secondary glaucoma. Five studies enrolled participants at low risk of trabeculectomy failure, five studies enrolled participants at high risk of failure, and one study enrolled people with both high and low risk of failure. None of the included trials enrolled participants with combined trabeculectomy/cataract surgery. 
Key results  Our review showed that the risk of failure of trabeculectomy at one year after surgery was slightly less in those participants treated with MMC compared to 5‐FU. All of the included randomised controlled trials contributed to this result, with a mixed study population of high‐ and low‐risk participants and varied methodology of antimetabolite application. We did not detect any significant differences between the subgroups of participants at low and high risk of failure, but the power of this analysis was low. 
We identified no difference between the visual outcomes of the group that received MMC and the group that received 5‐FU at one year postoperatively nor in the number of drops used postoperatively. However, we found evidence to suggest that MMC was more effective at lowering intraocular pressure than 5‐FU in both high‐ and low‐risk participants, achieving a lower mean intraocular pressure postoperatively than in those who were treated with 5‐FU at one year. This effect seemed to be greater in the high‐risk populations. 
Evaluating the overall complications across all studies revealed a slight favour toward using MMC, particularly with the incidence of epitheliopathy and hyphaema. There was a trend towards bleb leaks, wound leaks, late hypotony and cataract formation in the MMC‐treated group. 
None of the studies reported quality of life.
Quality of the evidence  We graded the quality of the evidence as low, mostly due to the risk of bias in the included studies. One bias we commonly encountered came from the different techniques of antimetabolite administration, making it difficult to conceal which medicine was being used. Furthermore, most studies only had a few complications to report, which meant that there were low numbers overall to include in the analysis of complications.","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Two Medicines Used During Glaucoma Surgery

## What is this study about?

This study compared two medicines—mitomycin C (MMC) and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)—that doctors use during glaucoma surgery. Both medicines help prevent scarring after surgery, which can affect how well the surgery works.

## Why does this matter?

High eye pressure can lead to glaucoma, a serious eye condition. One treatment is surgery called trabeculectomy, which helps lower eye pressure. During this surgery, doctors apply one of these two medicines to help the surgical wound heal properly and prevent scarring that could make the surgery fail.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at 11 studies that included 687 eyes from 679 people. They compared how well MMC and 5-FU worked at preventing surgery failure and lowering eye pressure one year after surgery.

## What did they find?

**Surgery success:** Eyes treated with MMC had fewer failures one year after surgery compared to 5-FU, but the difference was small and not completely certain.

**Eye pressure:** People who received MMC had lower eye pressure on average (about 3 points lower) compared to those who received 5-FU.

**Vision:** Both groups had similar amounts of vision loss after surgery.

**Side effects:** Both medicines caused few side effects. MMC caused less surface eye irritation and less bleeding inside the eye.

## What does this mean?

MMC may work slightly better than 5-FU for keeping eye pressure low after glaucoma surgery. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be completely certain. Doctors need more research to know which medicine is truly better.","### Plain Language Summary

#### What Was The Study About?

This study looked at two medicines, MMC and 5-FU, used during eye surgery for glaucoma. The surgery helps to lower pressure in the eye, and these medicines try to stop scar tissue from forming after surgery.

#### What Did The Researchers Want To Find Out?

The researchers wanted to see which medicine, MMC or 5-FU, worked better to keep the eye pressure low after surgery.

#### Who Was Involved?

The study included 687 eyes from 679 people. Participants were from different parts of the world, like the United States, Europe, Asia, and Africa. They were divided into groups based on their risk of surgery not working well: high risk and low risk.

#### What Did They Do?

Researchers looked at 11 different trials. They compared how well each medicine worked one year after surgery by checking if the surgery was still successful and by measuring eye pressure.

#### What Did They Find?

- **Success Rate:** Surgery worked better overall in people who got MMC compared to those who got 5-FU, but the difference wasn’t always clear.
- **Eye Pressure:** On average, MMC lowered eye pressure more than 5-FU, especially in the high-risk group.
- **Visual Changes:** Both MMC and 5-FU had similar results in how vision changed one year after surgery.
- **Side Effects:** Side effects were rare. However, MMC had fewer cases of certain issues like eye irritation and bleeding inside the eye.

#### Were There Any Problems?

The study had some problems with the quality of information and not all results were clear. So, the overall confidence in the results is low.

#### What Did The Researchers Conclude?

MMC might be better at keeping eye pressure low long-term, but more research is needed to be sure. Researchers also think finding new medicines to prevent scar formation without side effects would be helpful."
"Background
The use of anaesthetics in the elderly surgical population (more than 60 years of age) is increasing. Postoperative delirium, an acute condition characterized by reduced awareness of the environment and a disturbance in attention, typically occurs between 24 and 72 hours after surgery and can affect up to 60% of elderly surgical patients. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a new‐onset of cognitive impairment which may persist for weeks or months after surgery. 
Traditionally, surgical anaesthesia has been maintained with inhalational agents. End‐tidal concentrations require adjustment to balance the risks of accidental awareness and excessive dosing in elderly people. As an alternative, propofol‐based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) offers a more rapid recovery and reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting. Using TIVA with a target controlled infusion (TCI) allows plasma and effect‐site concentrations to be calculated using an algorithm based on age, gender, weight and height of the patient. 
TIVA is a viable alternative to inhalational maintenance agents for surgical anaesthesia in elderly people. However, in terms of postoperative cognitive outcomes, the optimal technique is unknown. 
Objectives
To compare maintenance of general anaesthesia for elderly people undergoing non‐cardiac surgery using propofol‐based TIVA or inhalational anaesthesia on postoperative cognitive function, mortality, risk of hypotension, length of stay in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU), and hospital stay. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2017), Embase (1974 to November 2017), PsycINFO (1887 to November 2017). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with participants over 60 years of age scheduled for non‐cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia. We planned to also include quasi‐randomized trials. We compared maintenance of anaesthesia with propofol‐based TIVA versus inhalational maintenance of anaesthesia. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and synthesized findings. 
Main results
We included 28 RCTs with 4507 randomized participants undergoing different types of surgery (predominantly cardiovascular, laparoscopic, abdominal, orthopaedic and ophthalmic procedures). We found no quasi‐randomized trials. Four studies are awaiting classification because we had insufficient information to assess eligibility. 
All studies compared maintenance with propofol‐based TIVA versus inhalational maintenance of anaesthesia. Six studies were multi‐arm and included additional TIVA groups, additional inhalational maintenance or both. Inhalational maintenance agents included sevoflurane (19 studies), isoflurane (eight studies), and desflurane (three studies), and was not specified in one study (reported as an abstract). Some studies also reported use of epidural analgesia/anaesthesia, fentanyl and remifentanil. 
We found insufficient reporting of randomization methods in many studies and all studies were at high risk of performance bias because it was not feasible to blind anaesthetists to study groups. Thirteen studies described blinding of outcome assessors. Three studies had a high of risk of attrition bias, and we noted differences in the use of analgesics between groups in six studies, and differences in baseline characteristics in five studies. Few studies reported clinical trials registration, which prevented assessment of risk of selective reporting bias. 
We found no evidence of a difference in incidences of postoperative delirium according to type of anaesthetic maintenance agents (odds ratio (OR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 2.26; 321 participants; five studies; very low‐certainty evidence); we noted during sensitivity analysis that using different time points in one study may influence direction of this result. Thirteen studies (3215 participants) reported POCD, and of these, six studies reported data that could not be pooled; we noted no difference in scores of POCD in four of these and in one study, data were at a time point incomparable to other studies. We excluded one large study from meta‐analysis because study investigators had used non‐standard anaesthetic management and this study was not methodologically comparable to other studies. We combined data for seven studies and found low‐certainty evidence that TIVA may reduce POCD (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87; 869 participants). 
We found no evidence of a difference in mortality at 30 days (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.33 to 4.45; 271 participants; three studies; very low‐certainty evidence). Twelve studies reported intraoperative hypotension. We did not perform meta‐analysis for 11 studies for this outcome. We noted visual inconsistencies in these data, which may be explained by possible variation in clinical management and medication used to manage hypotension in each study (downgraded to low‐certainty evidence); one study reported data in a format that could not be combined and we noted little or no difference between groups in intraoperative hypotension for this study. Eight studies reported length of stay in the PACU, and we did not perform meta‐analysis for seven studies. We noted visual inconsistencies in these data, which may be explained by possible differences in definition of time points for this outcome (downgraded to very low‐certainty evidence); data were unclearly reported in one study. We found no evidence of a difference in length of hospital stay according to type of anaesthetic maintenance agent (mean difference (MD) 0 days, 95% CI ‐1.32 to 1.32; 175 participants; four studies; very low‐certainty evidence). 
We used the GRADE approach to downgrade the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Reasons for downgrading included: study limitations, because some included studies insufficiently reported randomization methods, had high attrition bias, or high risk of selective reporting bias; imprecision, because we found few studies; inconsistency, because we noted heterogeneity across studies. 
Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain whether maintenance with propofol‐based TIVA or with inhalational agents affect incidences of postoperative delirium, mortality, or length of hospital stay because certainty of the evidence was very low. We found low‐certainty evidence that maintenance with propofol‐based TIVA may reduce POCD. We were unable to perform meta‐analysis for intraoperative hypotension or length of stay in the PACU because of heterogeneity between studies. We identified 11 ongoing studies from clinical trials register searches; inclusion of these studies in future review updates may provide more certainty for the review outcomes.","Injected versus inhaled medicines to maintain general anaesthesia during non‐cardiac surgery for cognitive outcomes in elderly people 
Background 
Anaesthesia during surgery in elderly people (more than 60 years of age) is increasing.
Traditionally, general anaesthesia is maintained with an inhaled drug (a vapour which the patient breathes in) which needs to be adjusted to ensure that the patient remains unconscious during surgery without receiving too much anaesthetic. An alternative method is to use propofol which is injected into a vein throughout the anaesthetic procedure; this is called total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA). 
Elderly people are more likely to experience confusion or problems with thinking following surgery, which can occur up to several days postoperatively. These cognitive problems can last for weeks or months, and can affect the patients' ability to plan, focus, remember, or undertake activities of daily living. We looked at two types of postoperative confusion: delirium (a problem with awareness and attention which is often temporary) and cognitive dysfunction (a persistent problem with brain function). 
TIVA with propofol may be a good alternative to inhaled drugs, and it is known that patients who have TIVA experience less nausea and vomiting, and wake up more quickly after anaesthesia. However, it is unknown which is the better anaesthetic technique in terms of postoperative cognitive outcomes. 
Review question 
To compare maintenance of general anaesthesia for elderly people undergoing non‐cardiac surgery using TIVA or inhalational anaesthesia on postoperative cognitive function, number of deaths, risk of low blood pressure during the operation, length of stay in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU), and hospital stay. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to November 2017. We included 28 randomized studies with 4507 participants in the review. We are awaiting sufficient information for the classification of four studies. 
All studies included elderly people undergoing non‐cardiac surgery and compared use of propofol‐based TIVA versus inhalational agents during maintenance of general anaesthesia. 
Key results 
We found little or no difference in postoperative delirium according to the type of anaesthetic maintenance agents from five studies (321 participants). We found that fewer people experienced postoperative cognitive dysfunction when TIVA with propofol was used in seven studies (869 participants). We excluded one study from analysis of this outcome because study authors had used methods to anaesthetize people which were not standard. 
We found little or no difference in the number of deaths from three studies (271 participants). We did not combine data for low blood pressure during the operation or length of stay in the PACU because we noted differences in studies, which may be explained by differences in patient management (for low blood pressure), and differences in how length of stay in the PACU is defined in each study . We found little or no difference in length of hospital stay from four studies (175 participants). 
Quality of the evidence 
Many studies did not report randomization methods adequately and all studies were at high risk of bias from anaesthetists, who needed to be aware of which anaesthetic agent they used. Outcome assessors in some studies were aware of which study group participants were in. We noted a large loss of participants in three studies, and some studies had differences between groups in the types of drugs used for pain, the types of monitors used to assess how deeply‐unconscious the patients were, and participant characteristics at the start of the studies; these factors may have influenced the results. Few studies had reported clinical trials registration. We found few studies for two outcomes (mortality and length of hospital stay), which made the results less precise. We judged evidence for postoperative delirium, number of deaths, length of stay in the PACU, and length of hospital stay to be very low certainty, and evidence for postoperative cognitive dysfunction, and low blood pressure during the operation to be low certainty. 
TIVA with propofol may reduce postoperative cognitive dysfunction. We are uncertain whether the choice of anaesthetic agents (TIVA with propofol, or inhalational agents) affects postoperative delirium, mortality and length of hospital stay. We found 11 ongoing studies in database and clinical trials register searches. Inclusion of these studies in future review updates will provide more certainty for the review outcomes.","# Plain Language Summary: Anesthesia Methods for Older Adults Having Surgery

## What is this study about?

This study compared two ways of giving anesthesia (sleep medicine) to people over 60 years old during surgery. Researchers wanted to know which method is safer and better for the brain after surgery.

## The Two Anesthesia Methods

**Method 1: Inhalational anesthesia** — A gas you breathe in through a mask to stay asleep during surgery.

**Method 2: TIVA (propofol-based)** — Medicine given through an IV (needle in the arm) to keep you asleep. A computer helps control the right amount based on your age, weight, and height.

## Why This Matters

After surgery, some older adults have problems with their thinking and memory. Two common problems are:
- **Delirium** — confusion and trouble paying attention that happens 1–3 days after surgery
- **Cognitive dysfunction** — trouble thinking clearly that can last weeks or months

Doctors want to know which anesthesia method causes fewer of these problems.

## What the Researchers Did

They looked at 28 studies involving 4,507 older adults who had different types of surgery. They compared how many people had thinking problems after surgery with each anesthesia method.

## Main Findings

- **Thinking problems after surgery**: TIVA *may* cause fewer thinking problems than gas anesthesia, but the evidence is not very strong.
- **Confusion after surgery**: No clear difference between the two methods.
- **Death within 30 days**: No difference between the two methods.
- **Low blood pressure during surgery**: Results were unclear because studies measured this differently.
- **Hospital stay**: No difference between the two methods.

## Bottom Line

The study found weak evidence that TIVA *might* be slightly better for brain function after surgery in older adults, but more research is needed to be sure.","### Plain Language Summary

**Purpose of the Study:**
This study looks at two types of anesthesia methods for people over 60 who are having surgery (not heart surgery) to see which one is better for brain function, safety, and recovery.

**Who Was Involved:**
The study included over 4,500 people aged 60 and older having different types of surgeries.

**What Was Tested:**
Two types of anesthesia were compared:
1. **Inhalational Anesthesia:** This is the traditional method using gases like sevoflurane, isoflurane, or desflurane.
2. **Propofol-Based TIVA (Total Intravenous Anesthesia):** This newer method uses a medicine called propofol, given through an IV.

**Key Questions:**
- Which method is better for brain function after surgery?
- Is one method safer than the other?
- Does the type of anesthesia affect how long people stay in the hospital?

**Main Findings:**
- **Postoperative Delirium:** No clear difference was found between the two methods.
- **Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD):** TIVA might help reduce this brain issue.
- **Mortality and Hospital Stay:** No clear difference found in the number of deaths or the length of hospital stays between the two methods.

**Other Considerations:**
- There were some differences in how the studies were done and reported. This makes it hard to say for sure which method is best.
- More studies are ongoing, which may help provide clearer answers in the future.

**Conclusion:**
We don't have strong evidence to say which anesthesia method is better overall for older patients. TIVA might help with reducing new cognitive problems, but more research is needed."
"Background
Cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions. They commonly affect people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND) at all stages of the disease. To date, the treatment of muscle cramps in ALS has been largely empirical without any evidence from randomised controlled trials. 
Objectives
To systematically assess the effect of interventions on muscle cramps as a primary or secondary endpoint or adverse event in people with ALS/MND. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (14 February 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 1, 2011 in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2011) and EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2011) and reference lists of articles searched using the terms motor neuron disease, motor neurone disease, motoneuron disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We contacted authors of trials for further information. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised and quasi‐randomised trials of oral medications in people with ALS which assessed cramps as a primary or secondary outcome measure or as an adverse event. We also included trials using subcutaneous or intravenous medications or physical therapy. 
Data collection and analysis
All authors applied the selection criteria and assessed study quality independently, and all authors performed independent data extraction. 
Main results
Twenty studies including 4789 participants were identified. Only one trial, of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), assessed cramps as the primary endpoint. Thirteen studies assessed cramps as a secondary endpoint. The medications comprised vitamin E, baclofen, riluzole, L‐threonine, xaliproden, indinavir, and memantine. Six studies assessed cramps as an adverse event. The medications comprised creatine, gabapentin, dextromethorphan, quinidine, and lithium. In all 20 studies no favourable effect for the treatment of cramps in ALS/MND could be demonstrated, but many studies were underpowered to draw a definite conclusion. A meta‐analysis of two small studies showed a statistically nonsignificant result for the amino acid L‐threonine for the treatment of cramps in ALS/MND. No study was identified using physical therapy as a therapeutic intervention for cramps. 
Authors' conclusions
There is no evidence to support the use of any intervention for muscle cramps in ALS/MND. More and larger randomised controlled trials evaluating treatments for muscle cramps in ALS/MND are needed.","Treatment for cramps in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease
A cramp is a sudden, involuntary painful contraction of a muscle. Many people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), experience cramps during the course of the disease. These range from mild cramps that do not affect daily activities and sleep, through to very severe, painful cramps. Some medications that are used to treat cramps in people with no medical condition or with conditions other than ALS have been tested in ALS clinical trials. These medicines include vitamin E, creatine, quinidine, and gabapentin. Other medications such as quinine sulfate, magnesium, lioresal, dantrolene, clonazepam, diphenylhydantoin, and gabapentin have been used to treat cramps in people with ALS but their effectiveness is unknown. In 2006 and 2010 the US Food and Drugs Administration issued warnings concerning the use of quinine sulfate, which was the previously most widely prescribed medication for cramps in the US. This review sought to find out how effective medications and physical treatments for cramps are for people with ALS. The reviewers identified 20 randomised controlled trials in people with ALS comprising a total of 4789 participants. Only one trial, of the drug tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), directly investigated the effectiveness of an intervention for cramps. Thirteen randomised controlled ALS trials investigated cramps secondarily among other variables. The medications comprised vitamin E, baclofen, riluzole, L‐threonine, xaliproden, indinavir, and memantine. Six randomised controlled ALS trials investigated cramps as adverse events. The medications comprised creatine, gabapentin, dextromethorphan, quinidine and lithium. None of the 20 studies could demonstrate any benefit, but the studies were small. Current evidence on the treatment of cramps in ALS is lacking and more research is needed.","# Plain Language Summary: Muscle Cramps in ALS/MND

## What is this study about?

Researchers looked at studies testing different treatments for muscle cramps in people with ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), also called motor neuron disease. Muscle cramps are sudden, painful tightening of muscles that people cannot control. Many people with ALS get cramps, but doctors don't have proven treatments for them.

## What did researchers do?

The team searched for all studies that tested medicines or physical therapy to treat cramps in ALS patients. They looked at studies from 1966 through early 2011. They found 20 studies that included almost 4,800 people total.

## What did they test?

The studies tested many different medicines, including:
- Vitamin E
- Baclofen
- Riluzole
- L-threonine (an amino acid)
- Creatine
- Gabapentin
- And several others

Only one study mainly focused on cramps. The others looked at cramps as a side effect or secondary concern.

## What did they find?

**None of the medicines tested showed they could help treat muscle cramps in ALS.** Most studies were too small to give a clear answer. No studies tested physical therapy for cramps.

## What do researchers recommend?

More research is needed. Scientists need to do larger, better-designed studies to find treatments that actually work for muscle cramps in ALS.","### Plain Language Summary

"Background
Thalassaemia is a hereditary anaemia due to ineffective erythropoiesis. In particular, people with thalassaemia major develop secondary iron overload resulting from regular red blood cell transfusions. Iron chelation therapy is needed to prevent long‐term complications. 
Both deferoxamine and deferiprone are effective; however, a review of the effectiveness and safety of the newer oral chelator deferasirox in people with thalassaemia is needed. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of oral deferasirox in people with thalassaemia and iron overload. 
Search methods
We searched the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 12 August 2016. 
We also searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Biosis Previews, Web of Science Core Collection and three trial registries: ClinicalTrials.gov; the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and the Internet Portal of the German Clinical Trials Register: 06 and 07 August 2015. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled studies comparing deferasirox with no therapy or placebo or with another iron‐chelating treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. 
Main results
Sixteen studies involving 1807 randomised participants (range 23 to 586 participants) were included. Twelve two‐arm studies compared deferasirox to placebo (two studies) or deferoxamine (seven studies) or deferiprone (one study) or the combination of deferasirox and deferoxamine to deferoxamine alone (one study). One study compared the combination of deferasirox and deferiprone to deferiprone in combination with deferoxamine. Three three‐arm studies compared deferasirox to deferoxamine and deferiprone (two studies) or the combination of deferasirox and deferiprone to deferiprone and deferasirox monotherapy respectively (one study). One four‐arm study compared two different doses of deferasirox to matching placebo groups. 
The two studies (a pharmacokinetic and a dose‐escalation study) comparing deferasirox to placebo (n = 47) in people with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia showed that deferasirox leads to net iron excretion. In these studies, safety was acceptable and further investigation in phase II and phase III studies was warranted. 
Nine studies (1251 participants) provided data for deferasirox versus standard treatment with deferoxamine. Data suggest that a similar efficacy can be achieved depending on the ratio of doses of deferoxamine and deferasirox being compared. In the phase III study, similar or superior efficacy for the intermediate markers ferritin and liver iron concentration (LIC) could only be achieved in the highly iron‐overloaded subgroup at a mean ratio of 1 mg of deferasirox to 1.8 mg of deferoxamine corresponding to a mean dose of 28.2 mg per day and 51.6 mg per day respectively. The pooled effects across the different dosing ratios are: serum ferritin, mean difference (MD) 454.42 ng/mL (95% confidence interval (CI) 337.13 to 571.71) (moderate quality evidence); LIC evaluated by biopsy or SQUID, MD 2.37 mg Fe/g dry weight (95% CI 1.68 to 3.07) (moderate quality evidence) and responder analysis, LIC 1 to < 7 mg Fe/g dry weight, risk ratio (RR) 0.80 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.92) (moderate quality evidence). The substantial heterogeneity observed could be explained by the different dosing ratios. Data on mortality (low quality evidence) and on safety at the presumably required doses for effective chelation therapy are limited. Patient satisfaction was better with deferasirox among those who had previously received deferoxamine treatment, RR 2.20 (95% CI 1.89 to 2.57) (moderate quality evidence). The rate of discontinuations was similar for both drugs (low quality evidence). 
For the remaining comparisons in people with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia, the quality of the evidence for outcomes assessed was low to very low, mainly due to the very small number of participants included. Four studies (205 participants) compared deferasirox to deferiprone; one of which (41 participants) revealed a higher number of participants experiencing arthralgia in the deferiprone group, but due to the large number of different types of adverse events reported and compared this result is uncertain. One study (96 participants) compared deferasirox combined with deferiprone to deferiprone with deferoxamine. Participants treated with the combination of the oral iron chelators had a higher adherence compared to those treated with deferiprone and deferoxamine, but no participants discontinued the study. In the comparisons of deferasirox versus combined deferasirox and deferiprone and that of deferiprone versus combined deferasirox and deferiprone (one study, 40 participants), and deferasirox and deferoxamine versus deferoxamine alone (one study, 94 participants), only a few patient‐relevant outcomes were reported and no significant differences were observed. 
One study (166 participants) included people with non‐transfusion dependent thalassaemia and compared two different doses of deferasirox to placebo. Deferasirox treatment reduced serum ferritin, MD ‐306.74 ng/mL (95% CI ‐398.23 to ‐215.24) (moderate quality evidence) and LIC, MD ‐3.27 mg Fe/g dry weight (95% CI ‐4.44 to ‐2.09) (moderate quality evidence), while the number of participants experiencing adverse events and rate of discontinuations (low quality evidence) was similar in both groups. No participant died, but data on mortality were limited due to a follow‐up period of only one year (moderate quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Deferasirox offers an important treatment option for people with thalassaemia and secondary iron overload. Based on the available data, deferasirox does not seem to be superior to deferoxamine at the usually recommended ratio of 1 mg of deferasirox to 2 mg of deferoxamine. However, similar efficacy seems to be achievable depending on the dose and ratio of deferasirox compared to deferoxamine. Whether this will result in similar efficacy and will translate to similar benefits in the long term, as has been shown for deferoxamine, needs to be confirmed. Data from randomised controlled trials on rare toxicities and long‐term safety are still limited. However, after a detailed discussion of the potential benefits and risks, deferasirox could be offered as the first‐line option to individuals who show a strong preference for deferasirox, and may be a reasonable treatment option for people showing an intolerance or poor adherence to deferoxamine.","Deferasirox for managing iron overload in people with thalassaemia
Background 
Thalassaemia is a hereditary anaemia due to a defect in the production of haemoglobin. Regular red blood cell transfusions are needed, particularly for the severe form of the disease, thalassaemia major. This results in iron overload. Since the human body has no means of actively getting rid of excessive iron, drug treatment (iron‐chelating drugs) is needed. Several years ago, a newer oral iron chelator, deferasirox, was introduced. 
Review question 
Does deferasirox offer advantages compared to placebo or to the other iron chelators deferoxamine or deferiprone in people with thalassaemia with regard to effectiveness and safety? 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to 12 August 2016. This updated review includes 16 randomised controlled studies (1807 participants) containing 20 comparisons of deferasirox versus another treatment. 
In people with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia, two studies compared deferasirox with placebo and nine studies (1251 participants) compared deferasirox with standard treatment of deferoxamine. Four studies (205 participants) compared deferasirox to deferiprone. One study each compared deferasirox and deferiprone respectively to deferasirox and deferiprone combination therapy (40 participants), deferasirox and deferoxamine combination therapy to deferoxamine alone (94 participants) and deferasirox and deferiprone combination therapy to deferiprone and deferoxamine combination therapy (96 participants). 
In people with non‐transfusion dependent thalassemia (individuals not requiring regular blood transfusions), one study (166 participants) compared deferasirox to placebo. The duration of the included studies ranged from 12 days to two years. 
Key results 
Two studies comparing deferasirox with placebo in people with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia showed that deferasirox was effective at removing iron. Nine other studies compared deferasirox with standard treatment of deferoxamine. Similar effectiveness seems possible, depending of the doses of the two drugs compared. It needs to be confirmed whether this leads to similar improvements in patient‐important outcomes in the long run. The safety of deferasirox was acceptable; however, rarer adverse events or long‐term side effects could not be adequately investigated due to the limited number of participants and the relatively short duration of the studies. Patient satisfaction was significantly better with deferasirox among those who had previously been treated with deferoxamine. The rate of discontinuations was similar for both drugs. Deferasirox may be an alternative for those individuals who do not tolerate, or have poor adherence with, deferoxamine. In people with a strong preference to deferasirox, potential benefits and risks should be discussed. 
One study (41 participants) reported that more individuals with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia experienced joint pain when treated with deferiprone than with deferasirox, but due to the large number of different types of adverse events reported and compared, this result may be due to chance. One study revealed that adherence to treatment was higher when both oral iron chelators, deferasirox and deferiprone are used than the combination of deferiprone and deferoxamine, but no participant discontinued the study. We found no evidence for any differences comparing deferasirox or deferiprone alone to combined deferasirox and deferiprone treatment or deferasirox and deferoxamine combination to deferoxamine alone, but the numbers of people in the studies were small and available data were very limited. 
One study in people with non‐transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia found deferasirox was better at reducing serum ferritin and liver iron concentration compared to placebo. However, there is no evidence on the impact on patient‐important outcomes or long‐term safety data in this population. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of included studies comparing deferasirox to deferoxamine in people with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia was moderate to low, mainly due fact that the investigators and participants knew which interventions had been assigned to which participants, the small number of participants included in the studies and the use of a surrogate markers (measures used in place of a hard clinical end point) instead of patient‐important outcomes. For the comparison of deferasirox to placebo in people with non‐transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia, the quality of the evidence was moderate to very low based on only one small study. For the other comparisons, the quality of the evidence was low to very low, mainly due to the inclusion of even fewer participants. Ideally, further randomised studies looking at patient‐important, long‐term outcomes and rarer adverse events, should be conducted.","# Plain Language Summary: Deferasirox for Thalassaemia and Iron Overload

## What is this study about?

Thalassaemia is an inherited blood condition. People with severe thalassaemia need regular blood transfusions, which causes too much iron to build up in their bodies. This extra iron can damage organs over time. Doctors use special medicines called iron chelators to remove extra iron from the body.

This review looked at studies testing a newer iron-removal medicine called deferasirox to see if it works well and is safe.

## Who was studied?

The review included 16 studies with 1,807 people who had thalassaemia and iron overload. Some people needed regular blood transfusions; others did not.

## What was tested?

Researchers compared deferasirox to:
- Placebo (fake medicine)
- Deferoxamine (an older iron-removal medicine)
- Deferiprone (another iron-removal medicine)
- Combinations of these medicines

## What did they find?

**Deferasirox vs. placebo:** Deferasirox successfully removed extra iron from the body and was safe.

**Deferasirox vs. deferoxamine:** Both medicines worked similarly at the right doses. Deferasirox was easier to take (it's a pill instead of an injection), and patients liked it better. However, it wasn't clearly better than deferoxamine.

**Deferasirox vs. other medicines:** There wasn't enough information to say which worked best.

**Side effects:** The safety information was limited, especially for long-term use.

## Bottom line

Deferasirox is a good treatment option for people with thalassaemia and iron overload. It may be especially helpful for people who prefer pills over injections or who have trouble with other medicines.","### Plain Language Summary

**Purpose of the Study**
This study looked at a medicine called deferasirox, used to help people with thalassemia who have too much iron in their bodies. Thalassemia is a condition where people need lots of blood transfusions, which can cause iron to build up. Too much iron can be harmful, so medicines, called iron chelators, help remove it. The study compared deferasirox with two other medicines, deferoxamine and deferiprone, to see how well it works and how safe it is.

**Who Took Part?**
The study included 16 different research projects with a total of 1807 participants. These were people with thalassemia who needed regular blood transfusions.

**What Did They Do?**
Researchers compared deferasirox to:
- A fake treatment (placebo)
- Other medicines like deferoxamine and deferiprone
- Different combinations of these medicines

**What Did They Find?**
- **Iron Levels:** Deferasirox helped reduce iron levels in the body, similar to the other treatments, depending on the doses used.
- **Safety:** Most people tolerated deferasirox well, with safety being okay in studies.
- **Satisfaction:** Some people preferred deferasirox over other treatments because it's easier to take as a pill rather than an injection.
- **Side Effects:** Some experienced side effects, but they were similar across the different medicines.

**Important Information**
- The study suggests that deferasirox is a good option for those who find other treatments hard to use or tolerate.
- Data on very rare side effects and long-term safety is limited, so more research is needed.

**Conclusion**
Deferasirox is an important treatment choice for managing extra iron in people with thalassemia. While it works similarly to other medicines, more research will help understand its long-term benefits and any rare side effects. It's a good option for people who prefer taking a pill or have trouble with other treatments."
"Background
Crowns for primary molars are preformed and come in a variety of sizes and materials to be placed over decayed or developmentally defective teeth. They can be made completely of stainless steel (know as 'preformed metal crowns' or PMCs), or to give better aesthetics, may be made of stainless steel with a white veneer cover or made wholly of a white ceramic material. In most cases, teeth are trimmed for the crowns to be fitted conventionally using a local anaesthetic. However, in the case of the Hall Technique, PMCs are pushed over the tooth with no local anaesthetic, carious tissue removal or tooth preparation. Crowns are recommended for restoring primary molar teeth that have had a pulp treatment, are very decayed or are badly broken down. However, few dental practitioners use them in clinical practice. This review updates the original review published in 2007. 
Objectives
Primary objective 
To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of all types of preformed crowns for restoring primary teeth compared with conventional filling materials (such as amalgam, composite, glass ionomer, resin modified glass ionomer and compomers), other types of crowns or methods of crown placement, non‐restorative caries treatment or no treatment. 
Secondary objective 
To explore whether the extent of decay has an effect on the clinical outcome of primary teeth restored with all types of preformed crowns compared with those restored with conventional filling materials. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 21 January 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library, 2014, Issue 12), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 21 January 2015) and EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 21 January 2015). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials and Open Grey for grey literature (to 21 January 2015). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the databases. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effectiveness of crowns compared with fillings, other types of crowns, non‐restorative approaches or no treatment in children with untreated tooth decay in one or more primary molar teeth. We would also have included trials comparing different methods of fitting crowns. 
For trials to be considered for this review, the success or failure of the interventions and other clinical outcomes had to be reported at least six months after intervention (with the exception of 'pain/discomfort during treatment and immediately postoperatively'). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the title and abstracts for each article from the search results. and independently assessed the full text for each potentially relevant study. At least two authors assessed risk of bias and extracted data using a piloted data extraction form. 
Main results
We included five studies that evaluated three comparisons. Four studies compared crowns with fillings; two of them compared conventional PMCs with open sandwich restorations, and two compared PMCs fitted using the Hall Technique with fillings. One of these studies included a third arm, which allowed the comparison of PMCs (fitted using the Hall Technique) versus non‐restorative caries treatment. In the two studies using crowns fitted using the conventional method, all teeth had undergone pulpotomy prior to the crown being placed. The final study compared two different types of crowns: PMCs versus aesthetic stainless steel crowns with white veneers. No RCT evidence was found that compared different methods of fitting preformed metal crowns (i.e. Hall Technique versus conventional technique). 
We considered outcomes reported at the dental appointment or within 24 hours of it, and in the short term (less than 12 months) or long term (12 months or more). Some of our outcomes of interest were not measured in the studies: time to restoration failure or retreatment, patient satisfaction and costs. 
Crowns versus fillings 
All studies in this comparison used PMCs. One study reported outcomes in the short term and found no reports of major failure or pain in either group. There was moderate quality evidence that the risk of major failure was lower in the crowns group in the long term (risk ratio (RR) 0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.56; 346 teeth in three studies, one conventional and two using Hall Technique). Similarly, there was moderate quality evidence that the risk of pain was lower in the long term for the crown group (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.67; 312 teeth in two studies). 
Discomfort associated with the procedure was lower for crowns fitted using the Hall Technique than for fillings (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87; 381 teeth) (moderate quality evidence). 
It is uncertain whether there is a clinically important difference in the risk of gingival bleeding when using crowns rather than fillings, either in the short term (RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.66; 226 teeth) or long term (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.06; 195 teeth, two studies using PMCs with conventional technique at 12 months) (low quality evidence). 
Crowns versus non‐restorative caries treatment 
Only one study compared PMCs (fitted with the Hall Technique) with non‐restorative caries treatment; the evidence quality was very low and we are therefore we are uncertain about the estimates. 
Metal crowns versus aesthetic crowns 
One split‐mouth study (11 participants) compared PMCs versus aesthetic crowns (stainless steel with white veneers). It provided very low quality evidence so no conclusions could be drawn. 
Authors' conclusions
Crowns placed on primary molar teeth with carious lesions, or following pulp treatment, are likely to reduce the risk of major failure or pain in the long term compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique may reduce discomfort at the time of treatment compared to fillings. The amount and quality of evidence for crowns compared to non‐restorative caries, and for metal compared with aesthetic crowns, is very low. There are no RCTs comparing crowns fitted conventionally versus using the Hall Technique.","Preformed crowns for managing decayed primary molar teeth in children
Background 
To stop further damage and restore function of primary molar teeth that are decayed or malformed, a dentist will usually use a filling (a soft material that is placed in the cavity and hardened) to restore the tooth to its original shape. Alternatively the dentist may place a crown over the tooth to cover it. This usually requires an injection in the gum to numb the tooth before trimming it down (conventional technique). These crowns are pre‐made (i.e. preformed) in a variety of sizes and can be metal or white, with the correct size being chosen to fit the trimmed down tooth. The Hall Technique is an alternative method for fitting metal crowns, where there is no need for an injection or tooth trimming as the crown is simply pushed over the tooth. Preformed crowns are recommended by specialists in children's dentistry for the management of baby back teeth (molars) when they are affected by moderate to advanced tooth decay, or where the enamel has malformed during development or the tooth has had to have root canal treatment. 
Review question 
This Cochrane review asked whether crowns are better than other ways of managing decay in children's baby teeth for reducing 'major failure' (an outcome that includes aspects such as toothache and dental abscess), pain during treatment and harm, and for improving satisfaction with treatment. It also asked whether metal or white crowns were better and whether a new fitting method called the Hall Technique was better than the conventional fitting technique. The review updates one originally published in 2007. 
Study characteristics 
We searched medical and dental sources for studies up to 21 January 2015. We identified five relevant studies. They were at high risk of bias because the participants knew which treatment they received and so did the people who treated them. 
Four studies compared crowns with fillings. Two of them compared metal crowns fitted using the conventional method with fillings and two compared metal crowns fitted using the Hall Technique with fillings. One of the studies also compared the Hall Technique with 'non‐restorative caries treatment' (not using either a filling or crown but opening the cavity to make it possible to clean with a toothbrush, sealing with fluoride varnish and encouraging toothbrushing). The final study compared crowns made of two different materials (stainless steel versus stainless steel with a white covering). We looked at what happened for each treatment at the time of the dental appointment or within 24 hours of treatment, in the short term (less than 12 months) and long term (12 months to 48 months). 
Key results 
Teeth restored with preformed crowns are less likely to develop problems (e.g. abscess) or cause pain in the long term, compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique (no injections or tooth trimming) gave less discomfort at the time of the appointment, when compared with fillings. Crowns may increase the risk of gingival bleeding but this result was unclear. Only one small study compared crowns with non‐restorative caries treatment and one small study compared metal and white crowns, and we could draw no reliable conclusions from these. Some of our outcomes of interest were not measured in any of the studies: these included time to restoration failure or retreatment, patient satisfaction and costs. 
Quality of the evidence 
There is moderate quality evidence that crowns are more effective than fillings for managing decay in primary molar teeth. There is moderate quality evidence that crowns fitted using the Hall Technique are less likely to cause abscesses and pain than fillings. The evidence comparing preformed crowns with non‐restorative caries management, and comparing preformed metal crowns with preformed white crowns, is very low quality so we do not know which is better. 
Author's conclusion 
Crowns placed on primary molar teeth with decay, or that have had pulp treatment, are likely to reduce the risk of major failure or pain in the long term compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique may reduce discomfort at the time of treatment compared to fillings.","# Plain Language Summary: Crowns for Baby Teeth

## What is this study about?

This review looks at whether crowns (caps that cover teeth) work better than fillings for fixing decayed baby molars (back teeth). Researchers wanted to know which treatment works best and is safest.

## What are crowns and fillings?

**Crowns** are tooth-shaped caps made of metal or white ceramic that cover a damaged tooth completely. They can be placed two ways:
- The regular way: the tooth is trimmed down and numbed first
- The Hall Technique: the crown is pushed over the tooth without numbing, trimming, or removing decay

**Fillings** are materials (like metal or white composite) placed directly into the cavity to fill the hole.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for studies comparing crowns to fillings and other treatments for baby molars with cavities. They looked at studies published through January 2015 and included only high-quality research studies.

## What did they find?

**Crowns vs. Fillings:**
- Crowns were much better at preventing major failure (tooth breaking down again) over time
- Crowns reduced pain over time
- The Hall Technique caused less discomfort during treatment than fillings
- Gum bleeding was similar between both treatments

**Crowns vs. Other Treatments:**
- Very little research compared crowns to other methods, so no clear conclusions

## Bottom Line

Crowns appear to work better than fillings for fixing decayed baby molars, especially over the long term. The Hall Technique may be more comfortable during treatment. However, more research is needed comparing different crown methods.","### Plain Language Summary

#### What is the Study About?
This study looks at how well preformed crowns work to fix baby teeth that are decayed or damaged. These crowns can be made of metal or metal with a white covering to look nicer.

#### Who is Involved?
The study focuses on young children with decayed baby molar teeth.

#### What Are They Testing?
1. **Crowns vs. Fillings**: They compare crowns to regular fillings to see which is better at preventing decay and pain.
2. **Different Crown Methods**: They also look at two ways to put on crowns - with and without tooth preparation.
3. **Crowns vs. No Treatment**: They compare crowns to not fixing the teeth at all.
4. **Different Crown Types**: They look at metal crowns versus crowns with a white covering.

#### What Will Happen in the Study?
- They'll check how well each treatment works by looking at how long the fix lasts, how much it costs, and if it causes pain or discomfort.
- They will compare results immediately after treatment and then again after several months.

#### What Did They Find?
- **Crowns vs. Fillings**: Crowns, especially those put on using the Hall Technique, might cause less pain and are more likely to last longer than fillings.
- **Comfort**: Crowns put on with the Hall Technique can be more comfortable than fillings.
- **Other Comparisons**: There isn't enough strong evidence to clearly say if crowns are better than no treatment or if metal crowns are better than disguised ones.

#### What About Safety?
The study checked for side effects like pain or bleeding. Crowns seem to have fewer problems in the long run compared to fillings.

#### Conclusion
Using crowns can help protect baby molars better and cause less pain than fillings, especially when the Hall Technique is used. However, more research is needed for other comparisons."
"Background
Collaborative care for severe mental illness (SMI) is a community‐based intervention, which typically consists of a number of components. The intervention aims to improve the physical and/or mental health care of individuals with SMI. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of collaborative care approaches in comparison with standard care for people with SMI who are living in the community. The primary outcome of interest was psychiatric admissions. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Specialised register in April 2011. The register is compiled from systematic searches of major databases, handsearches of relevant journals and conference proceedings. We also contacted 51 experts in the field of SMI and collaborative care. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) described as collaborative care by the trialists comparing any form of collaborative care with 'standard care' for adults (18+ years) living in the community with a diagnosis of SMI, defined as schizophrenia or other types of schizophrenia‐like psychosis (e.g. schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorders), bipolar affective disorder or other types of psychosis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors worked independently to extract and quality assess data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and we calculated mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs for continuous data. Risk of bias was assessed. 
Main results
We included one RCT (306 participants; US veterans with bipolar disorder I or II) in this review. We did not find any trials meeting our inclusion criteria that included people with schizophrenia. The trial provided data for one comparison: collaborative care versus standard care. All results are 'low or very low quality evidence'. 
Data indicated that collaborative care reduced psychiatric admissions at year two in comparison to standard care (n = 306, 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.99). 
The sensitivity analysis showed that the proportion of participants psychiatrically hospitalised was lower in the intervention group than the standard care group in year three: 28% compared to 38% (n = 330, 1 RCT, RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.99). 
In comparison to the standard care group, collaborative care significantly improved the Mental Health Component (MHC) of quality of life at the three‐year follow‐up, (n = 306, 1 RCT, MD 3.50, 95% CI 1.80 to 5.20). The Physical Health Component (PHC) of the quality of life measure at the three‐year follow‐up did not differ significantly between groups (n = 306, 1 RCT, MD 0.50, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.91). 
Direct intervention (all‐treatment) costs of collaborative care at the three‐year follow‐up did not differ significantly from standard care (n = 306, 1 RCT, MD ‐$2981.00, 95% CI $16934.93 to $10972.93). The proportion of participants leaving the study early did not differ significantly between groups (n = 306, 1 RCT, RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.79). There is no trial‐based information regarding the effect of collaborative care for people with schizophrenia. 
No statistically significant differences were found between groups for number of deaths by suicide at three years (n = 330, 1 RCT, RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.32), or the number of participants that died from all other causes at three years (n = 330, 1 RCT, RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.66). 
Authors' conclusions
The review did not identify any studies relevant to care of people with schizophrenia and hence there is no evidence available to determine if collaborative care is effective for people suffering from schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorders. There was however one trial at high risk of bias that suggests that collaborative care for US veterans with bipolar disorder may reduce psychiatric admissions at two years and improves quality of life (mental health component) at three years, however, on its own it is not sufficient for us to make any recommendations regarding its effectiveness. More large, well designed, conducted and reported trials are required before any clinical or policy making decisions can be made.","Collaborative care approaches for people with severe mental illness
Collaborative care aims to improve the physical and mental health of people with severe mental illness (SMI). Common to all definitions is that collaborative care aims to develop closer working relationships between primary care (family doctors or GPs and practice nurses) and specialist health care (such as Community Mental Health Teams). There are different ways in which this can be achieved, making collaborative care very complex. Integrating or joining‐up primary care and mental health services, so that they work better together, is intended to increase communication and joint working between health professionals (e.g. GPs, psychiatrists, nurses, pharmacists, psychologists). This is meant to provide a person with severe mental illness with better care, based in the community, which is often a less stigmatised setting than hospital, and that promotion of good practice helps consumers maintain contact with services. A major issue is that many GPs still feel that physical health problems (such as diabetes, heart disease, smoking cessation) are more their concern and see treatment of severe mental illness as the job of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals. Collaborative care aims to improve overall quality of care by ensuring that healthcare professionals work together, trying to meet the physical and mental health needs of people. The aim of the review was to assess the effectiveness of collaborative care in comparison to standard or usual care. An electronic search for trials was carried out in April 2011. The primary focus of interest was admissions to hospital. According to the one included study in this review, collaborative care may be effective in reducing going into hospital (less psychiatric admissions and other admissions). It also helps improve people’s quality of life and mental health. However, all evidence was either low or very low quality and further research is needed to determine whether collaborative care is good for people with SMI in terms of clinical outcomes or helping people feel better as well as its cost effectiveness.

## What is this study about?
This review looked at whether a team-based approach to mental health care (called ""collaborative care"") works better than regular care for adults living in the community with serious mental illnesses like bipolar disorder.

## Who was studied?
The review found only one study that met their requirements. That study included 306 U.S. military veterans with bipolar disorder (types I or II). **Important note:** The researchers found no studies about collaborative care for people with schizophrenia, so they couldn't draw any conclusions about that condition.

## What is collaborative care?
Collaborative care means different doctors and mental health workers (like psychiatrists, counselors, and nurses) work together as a team to help patients. The goal is to improve both mental and physical health care.

## What did they find?

**Hospital stays:** People who received collaborative care spent less time in the hospital for mental health reasons compared to those getting regular care.

**Quality of life:** Collaborative care improved how people felt mentally after three years. However, it didn't change their physical health or well-being.

**Cost:** The cost of collaborative care was about the same as regular care.

**Safety:** There were no major differences in deaths between the two groups.

## Bottom line
The researchers say more studies are needed before doctors can recommend collaborative care for serious mental illness. They especially need studies about people with schizophrenia.","### Plain Language Summary

**What Was the Study About?**
This study looked at a type of community help called ""collaborative care"" for people with mental health challenges who live outside of hospitals. The goal was to see if this care is better than regular care at reducing hospital visits and improving quality of life.

**Who Was In the Study?**
The study focused on U.S. veterans with bipolar disorder, a mental health condition. It did not include anyone with schizophrenia because no studies were found for that group.

**What Did They Do?**
Researchers compared two groups: 
1. People receiving collaborative care.
2. People receiving standard care.

**What Were They Looking For?**
They wanted to see if fewer people in the collaborative care group needed hospital care and if their quality of life improved.

**What Were the Results?**
- **Fewer Hospital Visits:** Those in the collaborative care group had fewer hospital visits after two years.
- **Improved Quality of Life:** After three years, people in the collaborative care group felt better about their mental health.
- **Cost and Physical Health:** Costs and physical health were about the same for both groups.
- **Other Findings:** No big difference was found in dropout rates or death rates between the two groups.

**What Do the Results Mean?**
The study suggests that collaborative care might help reduce hospital visits and improve mental health quality of life for veterans with bipolar disorder. However, because only one study was done, more research is needed to make strong recommendations.

**What's Next?**
More research is needed, especially for people with schizophrenia, to better understand if collaborative care can help them too."

A frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycle is when one or more embryos (frozen during a previous treatment cycle) are thawed and transferred to the uterus. Some women undergo fresh embryo transfer (ET) cycles with embryos derived from donated oocytes. In both situations, the endometrium is primed with oestrogen and progestogen in different doses and routes of administration. 
Objectives
To evaluate the most effective endometrial preparation for women undergoing transfer with frozen embryos or embryos from donor oocytes with regard to the subsequent live birth rate (LBR). 
Search methods
The Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, LILACS, trials registers and abstracts of reproductive societies' meetings were searched in June 2020 together with reference checking and contact with study authors and experts in the field to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating endometrial preparation in women undergoing fresh donor cycles and frozen embryo transfers. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. We analysed all available interventions versus placebo, no treatment, or between each other. The primary review outcome was live birth rate. Secondary outcomes were clinical and multiple pregnancy, miscarriage, cycle cancellation, endometrial thickness and adverse effects. 
Main results
Thirty‐one RCTs (5426 women) were included. Evidence was moderate to very low‐quality: the main limitations were serious risk of bias due to poor reporting of methods, and serious imprecision. 
Stimulated versus programmed cycle 
We are uncertain whether a letrozole‐stimulated cycle compared to a programmed cycle, for endometrial preparation, improves LBR (odds ratio (OR) 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 3.26; 100 participants; one study; very low‐quality evidence). 
Stimulating with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), letrozole or clomiphene citrate may improve clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.38; 656 participants; five studies; I2 = 11%; low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain if they reduce miscarriage rate (MR) (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.71; 355 participants; three studies; I2 = 0%; very low‐quality evidence). Endometrial thickness (ET) may be reduced with clomiphene citrate (mean difference(MD) ‐1.04, 95% CI ‐1.59 to ‐0.49; 92 participants; one study; low‐quality evidence). Other outcomes were not reported. 
Natural versus programmed cycle 
We are uncertain of the effect from a natural versus programmed cycle for LBR (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.28; 1285 participants; four studies; I2 = 0%; very low‐quality evidence) and CPR (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.01; 1249 participants; five studies; I2 = 60%; very low‐quality evidence), while a natural cycle probably reduces the cycle cancellation rate (CCR) (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.82; 734 participants; one study; moderate‐quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect on MR and ET. No study reported other outcomes. 
Transdermal versus oral oestrogens 
From low‐quality evidence we are uncertain of the effect transdermal compared to oral oestrogens has on CPR (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.25; 504 participants; three studies; I2 = 58%) or MR (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.09; 414 participants; two studies; I2 = 0%). Other outcomes were not reported. 
Day of starting administration of progestogen 
When doing a fresh ET using donated oocytes in a synchronised cycle starting progestogen on the day of oocyte pick‐up (OPU) or the day after OPU, in comparison with recipients that start progestogen the day prior to OPU, probably increases the CPR (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.08; 282 participants; one study, moderate‐quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect on multiple pregnancy rate (MPR) or MR. It probably reduces the CCR (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.74; 282 participants; one study; moderate‐quality evidence). No study reported other outcomes. 
Gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist versus control 
A cycle with GnRH agonist compared to without may improve LBR (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.19 to 5.78; 234 participants; one study; low‐quality evidence). From low‐quality evidence we are uncertain of the effect on CPR (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.43; 1289 participants; eight studies; I2 = 20%), MR (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.00; 828 participants; four studies; I2 = 0%), CCR (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.17; 530 participants; two studies; I2 = 0%) and ET (MD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.16; 697 participants; four studies; I2 = 4%). No study reported other outcomes. 
Among different GnRH agonists 
From very low‐quality evidence we are uncertain if cycles among different GnRH agonists improves CPR or MR. No study reported other outcomes. 
GnRH agonists versus GnRH antagonists 
GnRH antagonists compared to agonists probably improves CPR (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.90; 473 participants; one study; moderate‐quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect on MR and MPR. No study reported other outcomes. 
Aspirin versus control 
From very low‐quality evidence we are uncertain whether a cycle with aspirin versus without improves LBR, CPR, or ET. 
Steroids versus control 
From very low‐quality evidence we are uncertain whether a cycle with steroids compared to without improves LBR, CPR or MR. No study reported other outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence on the use of any particular intervention for endometrial preparation in women undergoing fresh donor cycles and frozen embryo transfers. In frozen embryo transfers, low‐quality evidence showed that clinical pregnancy rates may be improved in a stimulated cycle compared to a programmed one, and we are uncertain of the effect when comparing a programmed cycle to a natural cycle. Cycle cancellation rates are probably reduced in a natural cycle. Although administering a GnRH agonist, compared to without, may improve live birth rates, clinical pregnancy rates will probably be improved in a GnRH antagonist cycle over an agonist cycle. 
In fresh synchronised oocyte donor cycles, the clinical pregnancy rate is probably improved and cycle cancellation rates are probably reduced when starting progestogen the day of or day after donor oocyte retrieval. 
Adequately powered studies are needed to evaluate each treatment more accurately.","Endometrial preparation for egg donor recipients or for frozen embryo transfers
Review question 
What is the most effective method for endometrial preparation in women undergoing embryo transfers with frozen embryos or embryos derived from donor oocytes? 
Background 
Couples undergo infertility treatments due to male factor, female factors or unexplained infertility. After an unsuccessful fresh embryo transfer cycle, a frozen‐thawed embryo transfer can be performed when frozen embryos are available. Adequate hormonal preparation of the endometrium is of utmost importance for both egg donor and frozen embryo replacement cycles to provide the optimal chances of pregnancy. Many drugs and various modes of administration have been tried by several investigators in order to optimise implantation rates and consequently improve the success rates of the embryo transfer procedures: stimulated cycles (to generate endogenous oestradiol), programmed cycles (administering exogenous oestradiol) or natural cycles (allowing the ovaries to produce oestradiol without stimulation) are some of the options; avoiding spontaneous ovulation with gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and antagonists could have some impact; or using some other drugs such as aspirin or steroids that could potentially enhance the endometrial receptivity were also evaluated. 
Study characteristics 
We found 31 randomised controlled trials comparing different interventions such as the dose and route of administration of oestrogens and progestogen, the use of drugs that stop the patient from ovulating prematurely (GnRH agonists), and the use of other medications to improve the endometrium in a total of 5426 women. The evidence is current to June 2020. 
Key results 
We are uncertain whether a stimulated cycle (with letrozole) compared to a programmed cycle, for endometrial preparation, improves live birth. The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth following a programmed cycle is assumed to be 24%, the chance following a stimulated cycle would be between 13% and 51%. We are also uncertain of the impact on miscarriage rate and endometrial thickness. A stimulated cycle may improve clinical pregnancy rate. Data were lacking on multiple pregnancy, cycle cancellation and other adverse effects. 
We are uncertain whether a natural cycle improves the live birth rate, pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and endometrial thickness in comparison with a programmed cycle. Data were lacking for all other outcomes. 
We are uncertain if transdermal (delivered via the skin) oestrogens compared with oral (by mouth) oestrogens improve clinical pregnancy rate and miscarriage rate. Data were lacking for all other outcomes in this comparison. 
Starting progestogen on the day of the donor oocyte retrieval or the day after probably increases the clinical pregnancy rate and probably reduces the cycle cancellation rate. We are uncertain if it reduces the miscarriage rate. Data were lacking for all other outcomes. 
A cycle with GnRH agonist compared to without may improve live birth rate. We are uncertain of the effect of a GnRH cycle compared to no GnRH for the outcomes of clinical pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, and endometrial thickness. No study reported on the other outcomes for this comparison. 
We are uncertain if any GnRH agonist is better than other: a cycle with daily leuprolide or with deposit tryptorelin improves clinical pregnancy rate, or if daily acetate leuprolide or daily nafarelin reduces the miscarriage rate. Other outcomes were not reported. 
GnRH antagonists compared to agonists probably improve clinical pregnancy rate. We are uncertain of the effect on miscarriage rate and multiple pregnancy rate. No study reported the other outcomes. 
We are uncertain whether a cycle with aspirin compared to a cycle without improves live birth, clinical pregnancy rate or endometrial thickness. Data were lacking for all other outcomes. 
We are also uncertain whether a cycle with steroids compared to a cycle without steroids improves live birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate or miscarriage rate. No study reported on the other outcomes. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of moderate to very low‐quality. The main limitations in the evidence were poor reporting of study methods, and lack of precision in the findings for live birth.","# Plain Language Summary: Endometrial Preparation for Embryo Transfer

## What is this study about?

This review looked at different ways to prepare the uterus (womb) for embryo transfer. Embryo transfer is a procedure where an embryo is placed into a woman's uterus to try to achieve pregnancy. This can happen with frozen embryos from a previous cycle or with embryos created from donated eggs.

## Why does this matter?

Before an embryo is transferred, doctors give women hormones (estrogen and progesterone) to prepare the uterus. Researchers wanted to find out which preparation method works best to help women get pregnant and have a baby.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers reviewed 31 studies involving 5,426 women. They compared different ways of preparing the uterus, including:
- Using medicines to stimulate the ovaries versus not stimulating them
- Using natural cycles versus programmed cycles (with hormones)
- Different types and routes of hormone delivery
- Adding other medicines like aspirin or steroids

## What did they find?

**For frozen embryos:**
- Using stimulating medicines *may* help increase pregnancy rates compared to programmed cycles, but the evidence is weak
- Natural cycles probably reduce the need to cancel cycles
- Different hormone delivery methods (patches versus pills) showed unclear results

**For fresh donor egg cycles:**
- Starting progesterone on the day of or day after egg retrieval probably increases pregnancy rates and reduces cycle cancellations

**Other findings:**
- Using a GnRH agonist (a type of hormone medicine) *may* improve live birth rates
- Using a GnRH antagonist (a different hormone medicine) probably improves pregnancy rates better than agonists
- Aspirin and steroids showed unclear results

## What does this mean?

There is **not enough strong evidence** to say that one preparation method is clearly better than others. Doctors and patients should discuss which approach might work best for their situation. More research is needed to find the best way to prepare the uterus for embryo transfer.","**Plain Language Summary of a Clinical Trial on Embryo Transfers**

**Purpose of the Study:**
This study wants to find the best way to prepare the uterus for women getting frozen or donor egg embryo transfers, aiming to increase the chance of having a baby.

**What is Being Studied:**
- Different ways to prepare the uterus lining using hormones like estrogen and progestogen.
- Both frozen and fresh embryo transfers with donor eggs are included.

**Methods:**
- Researchers looked at various studies from medical databases and experts.
- They analyzed 31 studies with a total of 5,426 women.

**Key Findings:**
1. **Stimulated vs. Programmed Cycles:**
   - Using certain medicines like letrozole might help with pregnancy rates, but results are unclear about its effect on having a baby.
   
2. **Natural vs. Programmed Cycles:**
   - Unsure if one is better for pregnancy, but natural cycles may lower the chance of needing to cancel the procedure.

3. **Transdermal vs. Oral Estrogens:**
   - Not enough evidence to know which is better for pregnancy rates.

4. **Timing of Hormone Use:**
   - For fresh donor egg cycles, starting hormones right after egg retrieval might help with pregnancy rates and reduce cancellations.

5. **Other Treatments:**
   - Using a type of hormone called GnRH antagonists may be better for pregnancy rates than others. 
   - Not enough evidence on the effects of aspirin or steroids.

**Safety:**
The study found some limitations due to poor reporting and unclear methods, so results should be interpreted with caution.

**Conclusions:**
- There isn't enough evidence to choose a best method for preparing the uterus for embryo transfer.
- More detailed studies are needed to understand the effects better."
"Background
Vitamin D deficiency is common worldwide, contributing to nutritional rickets and osteomalacia which have a major impact on health, growth, and development of infants, children and adolescents. Vitamin D levels are low in breast milk and exclusively breastfed infants are at risk of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency. 
Objectives
To determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation given to infants, or lactating mothers, on vitamin D deficiency, bone density and growth in healthy term breastfed infants. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to 29 May 2020 supplemented by searches of clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and citations. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in breastfeeding mother‐infant pairs comparing vitamin D supplementation given to infants or lactating mothers compared to placebo or no intervention, or sunlight, or that compare vitamin D supplementation of infants to supplementation of mothers. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and independently extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We included 19 studies with 2837 mother‐infant pairs assessing vitamin D given to infants (nine studies), to lactating mothers (eight studies), and to infants versus lactating mothers (six studies). No studies compared vitamin D given to infants versus periods of infant sun exposure. 
Vitamin D supplementation given to infants: vitamin D at 400 IU/day may increase 25‐OH vitamin D levels (MD 22.63 nmol/L, 95% CI 17.05 to 28.21; participants = 334; studies = 6; low‐certainty) and may reduce the incidence of vitamin D insufficiency (25‐OH vitamin D < 50 nmol/L) (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.80; participants = 274; studies = 4; low‐certainty). However, there was insufficient evidence to determine if vitamin D given to the infant reduces the risk of vitamin D deficiency (25‐OH vitamin D < 30 nmol/L) up till six months of age (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.05; participants = 122; studies = 2), affects bone mineral content (BMC), or the incidence of biochemical or radiological rickets (all very‐low certainty). We are uncertain about adverse effects including hypercalcaemia. There were no studies of higher doses of infant vitamin D (> 400 IU/day) compared to placebo. 
Vitamin D supplementation given to lactating mothers: vitamin D supplementation given to lactating mothers may increase infant 25‐OH vitamin D levels (MD 24.60 nmol/L, 95% CI 21.59 to 27.60; participants = 597; studies = 7; low‐certainty), may reduce the incidences of vitamin D insufficiency (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.57; participants = 512; studies = 5; low‐certainty), vitamin D deficiency (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.24; participants = 512; studies = 5; low‐certainty) and biochemical rickets (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.44; participants = 229; studies = 2; low‐certainty). The two studies that reported biochemical rickets used maternal dosages of oral D3 60,000 IU/day for 10 days and oral D3 60,000 IU postpartum and at 6, 10, and 14 weeks. However, infant BMC was not reported and there was insufficient evidence to determine if maternal supplementation has an effect on radiological rickets (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.31; participants = 536; studies = 3; very low‐certainty). All studies of maternal supplementation enrolled populations at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. We are uncertain of the effects of maternal supplementation on infant growth and adverse effects including hypercalcaemia. 
Vitamin D supplementation given to infants compared with supplementation given to lactating mothers: infant vitamin D supplementation compared to lactating mother supplementation may increase infant 25‐OH vitamin D levels (MD 14.35 nmol/L, 95% CI 9.64 to 19.06; participants = 269; studies = 4; low‐certainty). Infant vitamin D supplementation may reduce the incidence of vitamin D insufficiency (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.94; participants = 334; studies = 4) and may reduce vitamin D deficiency (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.72; participants = 334; studies = 4) but the evidence is very uncertain. Infant BMC and radiological rickets were not reported and there was insufficient evidence to determine if maternal supplementation has an effect on infant biochemical rickets. All studies enrolled patient populations at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. Studies compared an infant dose of vitamin D 400 IU/day with varying maternal vitamin D doses from 400 IU/day to > 4000 IU/day. We are uncertain about adverse effects including hypercalcaemia. 
Authors' conclusions
For breastfed infants, vitamin D supplementation 400 IU/day for up to six months increases 25‐OH vitamin D levels and reduces vitamin D insufficiency, but there was insufficient evidence to assess its effect on vitamin D deficiency and bone health. For higher‐risk infants who are breastfeeding, maternal vitamin D supplementation reduces vitamin D insufficiency and vitamin D deficiency, but there was insufficient evidence to determine an effect on bone health. In populations at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplementation of infants led to greater increases in infant 25‐OH vitamin D levels, reductions in vitamin D insufficiency and vitamin D deficiency compared to supplementation of lactating mothers. However, the evidence is very uncertain for markers of bone health. Maternal higher dose supplementation (≥ 4000 IU/day) produced similar infant 25‐OH vitamin D levels as infant supplementation of 400 IU/day. The certainty of evidence was graded as low to very low for all outcomes.","Vitamin D supplementation for term breastfed infants to prevent vitamin D deficiency and improve bone health 
Review question: do vitamin D supplements for breastfed infants or their mothers prevent vitamin D deficiency and improve bone health? 
Background: vitamin D deficiency is common worldwide with infants at higher risk due to pigmentation, covering, avoidance of sun exposure or the latitude of where they live. Vitamin D is important for bone health, helping prevent nutritional rickets and fractures. Vitamin D levels are low in breast milk and exclusively breastfed infants are at risk of low vitamin D levels. 
Study characteristics: evidence is up‐to‐date as of May 2020. We identified 19 studies with 2837 mother‐infant pairs assessing vitamin D given to infants (nine studies), to breastfeeding mothers (eight studies), and to infants versus breastfeeding mothers (six studies). No studies compared vitamin D given to infants versus periods of infant sun exposure. 
Key results: for breastfed infants, vitamin D supplements may increase vitamin D levels and reduce the incidence of mildly low vitamin D levels, but there was insufficient information to determine if there was a reduction in vitamin D deficiency or in signs of poor bone health (low bone mineral content, nutritional rickets or fractures). For breastfed infants at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplementation for the mother may increase infant vitamin D levels and may prevent vitamin D deficiency. There was not enough information to determine if there are benefits for bone health. In populations at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplementation of infants may be better than vitamin D supplementation of the mother whilst breastfeeding for preventing vitamin D deficiency. However, the evidence is very uncertain for markers of bone health. High‐dose maternal supplementation (≥ 4000 IU per day) achieved similar infant vitamin D levels as infant supplementation with 400 IU per day. 
Certainty of evidence: the evidence is currently very uncertain for supplementation of vitamin D for breastfeeding mothers or supplementation of their infants in populations at low risk of vitamin D deficiency. In populations at high risk of vitamin D deficiency, there is low‐certainty evidence that vitamin D 400 IU per day given to the infant or higher doses given to the breastfeeding mother may prevent vitamin D deficiency, although effects on bone health are unclear.","# Plain Language Summary: Vitamin D for Breastfed Babies

## What is this study about?

This review looked at 19 research studies involving 2,837 mothers and babies to see if giving vitamin D helps breastfed infants stay healthy. Vitamin D is important for strong bones and growth, but breast milk doesn't have much of it.

## Who was studied?

Healthy, full-term babies who were breastfed and their mothers.

## What did researchers test?

Three different ways to give vitamin D:
1. **Directly to babies** (9 studies)
2. **To breastfeeding mothers** (8 studies)
3. **Comparing baby supplements to mother supplements** (6 studies)

## Main findings

**Giving vitamin D directly to babies (400 IU per day):**
- Likely increased vitamin D levels in babies' blood
- Likely reduced the number of babies with low vitamin D
- Not enough information to know if it prevented serious vitamin D deficiency or bone problems

**Giving vitamin D to mothers:**
- Likely increased vitamin D levels in their babies' blood
- Likely reduced low vitamin D in babies
- Likely reduced a bone condition called rickets in babies
- Not enough information about effects on baby growth or bone strength

**Comparing both methods:**
- Giving vitamin D directly to babies worked slightly better than giving it to mothers
- When mothers took higher doses (4,000+ IU per day), babies got similar vitamin D levels as babies who received direct supplements

## Safety

Researchers were unsure about possible side effects in all groups.

## Bottom line

For breastfed babies, vitamin D supplements appear helpful, but more research is needed to fully understand long-term bone health effects.","**Plain Language Summary**

**Why We Did This Study**

We looked at how giving vitamin D to either babies or their breastfeeding moms can help with vitamin D levels, bone health, and growth in healthy breastfed babies. Vitamin D is important for strong bones, but breastfed babies might not get enough from breast milk alone.

**Who Was in the Study**

The study involved 2,837 moms and their babies who were breastfeeding. We wanted to see if giving vitamin D to babies or their moms made a difference compared to not giving it.

**What We Found**

- **Vitamin D for Babies:** Giving babies 400 IU of vitamin D each day might raise their vitamin D levels and lower the chance of them not having enough vitamin D.

- **Vitamin D for Moms:** When breastfeeding moms took vitamin D, their babies also had higher vitamin D levels and a lower chance of being deficient.

- **Comparing Both:** Giving vitamin D directly to babies seemed to work better for increasing their vitamin D levels than giving it to moms. But both methods were helpful.

**Safety and Other Findings**

We need more information to know if vitamin D helps with bone health and if there are any side effects. The amount of evidence we have is not very strong, so more research is needed.

**Conclusion**

Giving 400 IU of vitamin D a day to breastfed babies can help their vitamin D levels. For moms at high risk of deficiency, taking vitamin D also helps. However, we are not sure how much it helps with bone strength, and we need more studies to say for sure."
"Background
Beta‐blockers are an essential part of standard therapy in adult congestive heart failure and therefore, are expected to be beneficial in children. However, congestive heart failure in children differs from that in adults in terms of characteristics, aetiology, and drug clearance. Therefore, paediatric needs must be specifically investigated. This is an update of a Cochrane review previously published in 2009. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of beta‐adrenoceptor‐blockers (beta‐blockers) in children with congestive heart failure. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS up to November 2015. Bibliographies of identified studies were checked. No language restrictions were applied. 
Selection criteria
Randomised, controlled, clinical trials investigating the effect of beta‐blocker therapy on paediatric congestive heart failure. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted and assessed data from the included trials.
Main results
We identified four new studies for the review update; the review now includes seven studies with 420 participants. Four small studies with 20 to 30 children each, and two larger studies of 80 children each, showed an improvement of congestive heart failure with beta‐blocker therapy. A larger study with 161 participants showed no evidence of benefit over placebo in a composite measure of heart failure outcomes. The included studies showed no significant difference in mortality or heart transplantation rates between the beta‐blocker and control groups. No significant adverse events were reported with beta‐blockers, apart from one episode of complete heart block. A meta‐analysis of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and fractional shortening (LVFS) data showed a very small improvement with beta‐blockers. 
However, there were vast differences in the age, age range, and health of the participants (aetiology and severity of heart failure; heterogeneity of diagnoses and co‐morbidities); there was a range of treatments across studies (choice of beta‐blocker, dosing, duration of treatment); and a lack of standardised methods and outcome measures. Therefore, the primary outcomes could not be pooled in meta‐analyses. 
Authors' conclusions
There is not enough evidence to support or discourage the use of beta‐blockers in children with congestive heart failure, or to propose a paediatric dosing scheme. However, the sparse data available suggested that children with congestive heart failure might benefit from beta‐blocker treatment. Further investigations in clearly defined populations with standardised methodology are required to establish guidelines for therapy. Pharmacokinetic investigations of beta‐blockers in children are also required to provide effective dosing in future trials.","Beta‐blockers for children with congestive heart failure
Background 
The term congestive heart failure describes a disorder in which the heart is unable to sufficiently and efficiently pump blood through the body. Depending on the severity of the condition, this causes breathlessness and fatigue due to insufficient oxygen supply, and an accumulation of fluids in tissues and organs. 
In children, congestive heart failure is mainly due to congenital heart defects. Drug treatment, depending on the specific condition, may be used for long‐term control of heart failure, or to bridge the time until corrective surgery. For dilated or restrictive cardiomyopathy, a disorder with high mortality, heart transplantation remains the only option when drug treatment fails. 
Beta‐blockers have proven beneficial and even life‐saving in adults with congestive heart failure and therefore, are part of the standard treatment. For children, similar benefits could be expected, but beta‐blockers are used, if at all, off‐label (i.e. they are not recommended for children). Since the causes for heart failure are different in children than they are in adults, the main effect and adverse events may differ. Dosing might also have to be specifically adapted for different age groups. 
Study characteristics 
This review summarises and discusses the available information on the use of beta‐blockers in children with congestive heart failure. Seven studies, with a total of 420 children were included in the review. 
Key results 
Beta‐blocker therapy improved heart failure in four small studies with less than 30 participants each, and two larger studies with 80 participants each. However, the largest trial, with 161 participants, did not show a significant effect of the investigated beta‐blocker over placebo. 
None of the studies reported any severe beta‐blocker‐related adverse events, apart from one child who had a heart rhythm disturbance.  
Conclusions 
There were not enough data to recommend or discourage the use of beta‐blockers in children with congestive heart failure. However, the current available data suggest that children with heart failure might benefit from beta‐blocker treatment. Further investigations are required to establish guidelines for therapy.","# Plain Language Summary: Beta-Blockers for Heart Problems in Children

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether a type of heart medicine called beta-blockers helps children whose hearts don't pump blood well. These medicines are commonly used in adults with this problem, but doctors aren't sure if they work the same way in children.

## Who was studied?

The review included 7 different studies with a total of 420 children. The children had heart problems that made it hard for their hearts to pump blood to their bodies.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for studies that compared children taking beta-blockers to children taking a fake medicine (placebo). They looked at whether the medicine helped the children's hearts work better and whether it caused any problems.

## What did they find?

**The good news:**
- Some smaller studies showed that beta-blockers seemed to help children's hearts work better
- The medicine didn't cause serious side effects in most children
- No more children died or needed heart transplants in the beta-blocker group compared to the placebo group

**The problem:**
- One larger study didn't show that beta-blockers helped
- The studies were very different from each other (different ages of children, different types of heart problems, different amounts of medicine)
- Because the studies were so different, researchers couldn't combine all the results

## What does this mean?

Right now, there isn't enough proof that beta-blockers definitely help or don't help children with heart problems. More research is needed with similar groups of children and the same methods to figure out if these medicines work and what dose is best for kids.","### Plain Language Summary

**What is the study about?**  
This study looks at the use of a type of medicine called beta-blockers in kids with a heart problem called congestive heart failure. Doctors already use these medicines for adults, but we need to learn more about how they work for children.

**What was the goal?**  
The goal was to see if beta-blockers help children with this heart problem.

**How was the study done?**  
Researchers searched for past studies on this topic by looking at medical databases. They focused on studies where kids were randomly given either beta-blockers or a placebo (a fake treatment).

**What did they find?**  
They found seven studies with a total of 420 kids. In some smaller studies, beta-blockers seemed to help improve the heart condition in kids. However, a bigger study showed no real difference between beta-blockers and the placebo for overall heart health. There weren’t any major safety issues with beta-blockers, except for one serious heart issue in a child.

**Were there any problems with the studies?**  
Yes, there were differences in ages and health conditions of the kids, the types of beta-blockers used, and how the results were measured. This made it hard to combine all the findings.

**What do the authors think?**  
Right now, there isn't enough proof to say if kids with this heart problem should use beta-blockers or not. More research is needed with set rules and similar groups of children to find out the best way to use these medicines for kids."

We updated the searches of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Specialized Register (24 May 2010), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 2, 2010), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2010), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2010), AMED (January 1985 to May 2010), LILACS (from January 1982 to May 2010) and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System (January 1978 to May 2010) for randomised controlled trials using 'Bell's palsy' and its synonyms, 'idiopathic facial paralysis' or 'facial palsy' as well as search terms including 'acupuncture'. Chinese journals in which we thought we might find randomised controlled trials relevant to our study were handsearched. We reviewed the bibliographies of the randomised trials and contacted the authors and known experts in the field to identify additional published or unpublished data. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials involving acupuncture by needle insertion in the treatment of Bell's palsy irrespective of any language restrictions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors identified potential articles from the literature search, extracted data and assessed quality of each trial independently. All disagreements were resolved by discussion between the review authors. 
Main results
The literature search and handsearching identified 49 potentially relevant articles. Of these, six RCTs were included involving 537 participants with Bell's palsy. Two more possible trials were identified in the update than the previous version of this systematic review, but both were excluded because they were not real RCTs. Of the six included trials, five used acupuncture while the other one used acupuncture combined with drugs. No trial reported on the outcomes specified for this review. Harmful side effects were not reported in any of the trials. Poor quality caused by flaws in study design or reporting (including uncertain method of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding) and clinical differences between trials prevented reliable conclusions about the efficacy of acupuncture. 
Authors' conclusions
The quality of the included trials was inadequate to allow any conclusion about the efficacy of acupuncture. More research with high quality trials is needed.","Acupuncture for Bell's palsy
Bell's palsy or idiopathic facial palsy is the most common disorder affecting the facial nerves and results in weakness or paralysis on one side of the face. The paralysis causes distortion of the face and interferes with normal functions, such as closing the eye and eating. It is thought to be caused by inflammation of the facial nerve. 
According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, facial paralysis is known as 'deviated mouth'. It was attributed to 'wind' by past dynasties. 'Qi' refers to the vital substances comprising the human body and the physiological functions of viscera and bowels, channels and collaterals. It maintains life activities and reflects the resistance of the human body. Deficiency of 'qi' allows the invasion of exogenous pathogenic wind. Acupuncture is part of Traditional Chinese Medicine and dates back thousands of years. It involves inserting fine needles into specific points on the skin or applying various other techniques to the acupuncture points to bring about healing. In Bell's palsy, acupuncture treatment might have numerous beneficial effects. This review aimed to review systematically all randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials, which examined the effectiveness of acupuncture by needle insertion for Bell's palsy. Six studies including a total of 537 participants met the inclusion criteria. Five studies used acupuncture while the other used acupuncture combined with drugs. No trials reported on the outcomes specified for this review. Harmful side effects were not reported in any of the trials. Poor quality caused by flaws in study design or reporting (including uncertain method of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding) and clinical differences between trials prevented reliable conclusions about the efficacy of acupuncture. More research with high quality trials is needed.","# Plain Language Summary: Acupuncture for Bell's Palsy

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether acupuncture (using thin needles placed in the skin) can help people recover faster from Bell's palsy, a condition where one side of the face suddenly becomes weak or paralyzed.

## Why does this matter?

Bell's palsy happens when the nerve that controls facial muscles becomes swollen. Some studies from China suggested acupuncture might help people get better. Researchers wanted to find out if this was true.

## What did researchers do?

The team searched for high-quality studies that tested acupuncture as a treatment for Bell's palsy. They looked through medical databases and Chinese medical journals from the 1960s through 2010. They found 49 articles that might be relevant.

## What did they find?

Only 6 studies were good enough to include in the review. These studies involved 537 people with Bell's palsy. Five studies used acupuncture alone, and one combined acupuncture with medicine.

**The problem:** The studies had serious quality issues. They didn't clearly explain how they picked participants, didn't use proper blinding (where people don't know if they got the real treatment), and didn't measure the right outcomes. Because of these problems, researchers couldn't tell if acupuncture actually works.

**The good news:** No harmful side effects were reported.

## What's the bottom line?

There isn't enough good evidence yet to say whether acupuncture helps Bell's palsy. Better-quality studies are needed.","**Plain Language Summary: Acupuncture for Bell's Palsy**

**Background**
Bell's palsy is when one side of your face suddenly becomes weak. Some studies in China say acupuncture can help.

**Objective**
The goal was to see if acupuncture helps people with Bell's palsy get better faster and have fewer problems later on.

**How We Did the Study**
Researchers looked through many medical records and articles up to May 2010 to find studies that tested acupuncture on Bell's palsy. They checked places like MEDLINE and other databases. They also searched Chinese journals by hand and talked to experts to make sure they found all the studies.

**Criteria for Studies**
They looked for studies where acupuncture was done with needles on people with Bell's palsy. It didn’t matter what language the study was in.

**Gathering Data**
Two researchers went through the studies, picked out the useful data, and checked the quality of each one. If they disagreed, they talked it over until they agreed.

**Results**
- 49 articles were found, but only 6 studies worked for this research.
- Total of 537 people with Bell's palsy were in these studies.
- 5 studies used only acupuncture; 1 study used acupuncture with medicine.
- No study gave the specific results this review wanted.
- No harmful side effects from acupuncture were reported.

**Quality of Studies**
There were problems with how the studies were done, making it hard to trust the results. Issues included unclear ways the studies were set up and differences between them.

**Conclusion**
We can't say if acupuncture works for Bell's palsy because the studies aren't strong enough. We need better research to find out."
"Background
Foot wounds in people with diabetes mellitus (DM) are a common and serious global health issue. People with DM are prone to developing foot ulcers and, if these do not heal, they may also undergo foot amputation surgery resulting in postoperative wounds. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a technology that is currently used widely in wound care. NPWT involves the application of a wound dressing attached to a vacuum suction machine. A carefully controlled negative pressure (or vacuum) sucks wound and tissue fluid away from the treated area into a canister. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision‐making regarding its use. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of negative pressure wound therapy compared with standard care or other therapies in the treatment of foot wounds in people with DM in any care setting. 
Search methods
In January 2018, for this first update of this review, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies, reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. We identified six additional studies for inclusion in the review. 
Selection criteria
Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of any brand of NPWT in the treatment of foot wounds in people with DM, irrespective of date or language of publication. Particular effort was made to identify unpublished studies. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Initial disagreements were resolved by discussion, or by including a third review author when necessary. We presented and analysed data separately for foot ulcers and postoperative wounds. 
Main results
Eleven RCTs (972 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Study sample sizes ranged from 15 to 341 participants. One study had three arms, which were all included in the review. The remaining 10 studies had two arms. Two studies focused on postamputation wounds and all other studies included foot ulcers in people with DM. Ten studies compared NPWT with dressings; and one study compared NPWT delivered at 75 mmHg with NPWT delivered at 125 mmHg. Our primary outcome measures were the number of wounds healed and time to wound healing. 
NPWT compared with dressings for postoperative wounds 
Two studies (292 participants) compared NPWT with moist wound dressings in postoperative wounds (postamputation wounds). Only one study specified a follow‐up time, which was 16 weeks. This study (162 participants) reported an increased number of healed wounds in the NPWT group compared with the dressings group (risk ratio (RR) 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 2.01; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision). This study also reported that median time to healing was 21 days shorter with NPWT compared with moist dressings (hazard ratio (HR) calculated by review authors 1.91, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.99; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision). Data from the two studies suggest that it is uncertain whether there is a difference between groups in amputation risk (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.02; 292 participants; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision). 
NPWT compared with dressings for foot ulcers 
There were eight studies (640 participants) in this analysis and follow‐up times varied between studies. Six studies (513 participants) reported the proportion of wounds healed and data could be pooled for five studies. Pooled data (486 participants) suggest that NPWT may increase the number of healed wounds compared with dressings (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.72; I² = 0%; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). Three studies assessed time to healing, but only one study reported usable data. This study reported that NPWT reduced the time to healing compared with dressings (hazard ratio (HR) calculated by review authors 1.82, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.60; 341 participants; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). 
Data from three studies (441 participants) suggest that people allocated to NPWT may be at reduced risk of amputation compared with people allocated to dressings (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.70; I² = 0%; low‐certainty evidence; downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). 
Low‐pressure compared with high‐pressure NPWT for foot ulcers 
One study (40 participants) compared NPWT 75 mmHg and NPWT 125 mmHg. Follow‐up time was four weeks. There were no data on primary outcomes. There was no clear difference in the number of wounds closed or covered with surgery between groups (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.47; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for serious imprecision) and adverse events (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 8.04; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for serious imprecision). 
Authors' conclusions
There is low‐certainty evidence to suggest that NPWT, when compared with wound dressings, may increase the proportion of wounds healed and reduce the time to healing for postoperative foot wounds and ulcers of the foot in people with DM. For the comparisons of different pressures of NPWT for treating foot ulcers in people with DM, it is uncertain whether there is a difference in the number of wounds closed or covered with surgery, and adverse events. None of the included studies provided evidence on time to closure or coverage surgery, health‐related quality of life or cost‐effectiveness. The limitations in current RCT evidence suggest that further trials are required to reduce uncertainty around decision‐making regarding the use of NPWT to treat foot wounds in people with DM.","Negative pressure wound therapy for treating foot wounds in people with diabetes mellitus
What was the aim of this review? 
We reviewed the evidence about whether or not negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is effective in treating foot wounds in people with diabetes. Researchers from Cochrane collected and analysed all relevant studies (randomised controlled trials; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) to answer this question and found 11 relevant studies. 
Key messages 
We cannot be certain whether NPWT is effective for treating foot wounds in people with diabetes. There is some low‐certainty evidence that NPWT increases the number of wounds healed compared with dressings, and may reduce the time it takes wounds to heal. We are uncertain about the effectiveness of different pressures of NPWT on wound healing. Overall, the reliability of the evidence provided by the trials is too low for us to be certain of the benefits and harms of NPWT for treating foot wounds in people with diabetes. 
What did the review study? 
Diabetes mellitus is a common condition that leads to high blood glucose (blood sugar) concentrations, with around 2.8 million people affected in the UK (approximately 4.3% of the population). Some people with diabetes can develop ulcers on their feet. These wounds can take a long time to heal, they can be painful and become infected. Ulceration of the foot in people with diabetes can also lead to a higher risk of amputation of parts of the foot or leg. Generally, people with diabetes are at a higher risk of lower‐limb amputation than people without diabetes. 
NPWT is a treatment currently being used for wounds including leg ulcers. NPWT involves the application of a wound dressing attached to a vacuum suction machine which sucks any wound and tissue fluid away from the treated area into a canister. Worldwide, the use of NPWT is increasing. However, it is expensive compared with wound treatments such as dressings. 
We wanted to find out if NPWT could help foot wounds in people with diabetes to heal more quickly and effectively. We wanted to know if people treated with NPWT experienced any side effects. We were also interested in the impact of NPWT on people's quality of life. 
What were the main results of the review? 
In January 2018, we searched for randomised controlled trials that compared NPWT with other treatments for foot ulcers or other open wounds of the foot in people with diabetes. We found 11 trials involving 972 adults. Participant numbers in each trial ranged from 15 to 341 and trial follow‐up (observation) times ranged from four weeks to 16 weeks where specified. Not all the studies stated how they were funded. Two were funded by an NPWT manufacturer. 
There is low‐certainty evidence to suggest that NPWT may be effective in healing postoperative foot wounds and ulcers of the foot in people with diabetes compared with wound dressings, in terms of the proportion of wounds healed and time to healing. For the comparison of different pressures of NPWT for foot ulcers in people with diabetes, we are uncertain whether there is a difference in the number of wounds closed or covered with surgery, and side effects. There was no evidence available on time to closure or coverage surgery, health‐related quality of life and cost‐effectiveness. 
How up to date was this review? 
We searched for studies that had been published up to January 2018.","# Plain Language Summary: Negative Pressure Wound Therapy for Foot Wounds in People with Diabetes

## What is this study about?

People with diabetes often develop wounds on their feet that are hard to heal. This review looked at a treatment called negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) to see if it helps these wounds heal better than regular wound care.

## What is NPWT?

NPWT is a machine that gently sucks fluid away from a wound using a special vacuum dressing. Think of it like a bandage connected to a small vacuum cleaner that removes extra fluid from the wound.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at 11 studies with 972 people total. They compared NPWT to regular wound dressings and also compared different strength levels of NPWT.

## What did they find?

**For wounds after foot amputation surgery:**
- NPWT helped more wounds heal compared to regular dressings
- Wounds healed about 21 days faster with NPWT
- It's unclear if NPWT reduced the need for more amputations

**For foot ulcers (open sores):**
- NPWT may help more wounds heal compared to regular dressings
- NPWT may help wounds heal faster
- NPWT may reduce the chance of needing an amputation

**Comparing different NPWT strengths:**
- One small study found no clear difference between using NPWT at different vacuum strengths

## Important limitations

The evidence is not very strong. The studies were small, and researchers need more studies to be sure NPWT really works better. No studies looked at quality of life or cost.","### Study Summary: Using Negative Pressure Wound Therapy for Foot Wounds in Diabetes

**Objective:**  
The study aims to see how well negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) works compared to regular wound dressings for treating foot wounds in people with diabetes. Foot wounds, including ulcers and those after amputation surgery, are common in people with diabetes.

**What is NPWT?**  
NPWT is a treatment that uses a special dressing and a vacuum machine to help heal wounds by removing fluid.

**Research Process:**  
Researchers looked at different studies, including both finished and ongoing ones, to gather data. They focused on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which are a reliable type of study.

**Participants:**  
The review included 11 studies with a total of 972 participants. 

**Key Findings:**

1. **Post-Surgery Wounds:**
   - Two studies with 292 participants compared NPWT to regular moist dressings after amputation.
   - One study showed that wounds healed more often and faster with NPWT. 

2. **Foot Ulcers:**
   - Eight studies with 640 participants focused on foot ulcers.
   - NPWT seemed to help more wounds heal and reduced healing time compared to dressings.
   - There was a lower risk of needing an amputation with NPWT.

3. **Different NPWT Pressures:**
   - One study looked at two different NPWT pressure levels but found no clear difference in healing or side effects.

**Conclusions:**
- NPWT might help heal foot wounds better than regular dressings, but the evidence is not very strong, and more research is needed.
- It is unclear if different vacuum pressures make a difference in healing or side effects.
- The studies did not explore costs or the impact on quality of life.

**Safety and Further Research:**
The results suggest NPWT could be beneficial, but more research is needed to confirm these findings and help make better decisions for treating foot wounds in people with diabetes."
"Background
The standard duration of treatment for children with acute group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) pharyngitis with oral penicillin is 10 days. Shorter duration antibiotics may have comparable efficacy. 
Objectives
To summarize the evidence regarding the efficacy of two to six days of newer oral antibiotics (short duration) compared to 10 days of oral penicillin (standard duration) in treating children with acute GABHS pharyngitis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2012, Issue 3) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group’s Specialized Register, MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 3, 2012) and EMBASE (January 1990 to April 2012). 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short duration oral antibiotics to standard duration oral penicillin in children aged 1 to 18 years with acute GABHS pharyngitis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors scanned the titles and abstracts of retrieved citations and applied the inclusion criteria. We retrieved included studies in full, and extracted data. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality. 
Main results
We included 20 studies with 13,102 cases of acute GABHS pharyngitis. The updated search did not identify any new eligible studies; the majority of studies were at high risk of bias. However, the majority of the results were consistent. Compared to standard duration treatment, the short duration treatment studies had shorter periods of fever (mean difference (MD) ‐0.30 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.45 to ‐0.14) and throat soreness (MD ‐0.50 days, 95% CI ‐0.78 to ‐0.22); lower risk of early clinical treatment failure (odds ratio (OR) 0.80, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.94); no significant difference in early bacteriological treatment failure (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.20) or late clinical recurrence (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.08). However, the overall risk of late bacteriological recurrence was worse in the short duration treatment studies (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.48), although no significant differences were found when studies of low dose azithromycin (10 mg/kg) were eliminated (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.22). Three studies reported long duration complications. Out of 8135 cases of acute GABHS pharyngitis, only six cases in the short duration treatment versus eight in the standard duration treatment developed long‐term complications in the form of glomerulonephritis and acute rheumatic fever, with no statistically significant difference (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.64). 
Authors' conclusions
Three to six days of oral antibiotics had comparable efficacy compared to the standard duration 10‐day course of oral penicillin in treating children with acute GABHS pharyngitis. . In areas where the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease is still high, our results must be interpreted with caution.","The effect of short duration versus standard duration antibiotic therapy for streptococcal throat infection in children 
Streptococcal (strep) throat infection is very common. A 10‐day course of penicillin is prescribed mainly to protect against the complication of acute rheumatic fever, which can occur approximately 20 days after streptococcal throat and cause damage to the heart valves. Cases of acute rheumatic fever have dropped dramatically in high‐income countries. Newer antibiotics taken for a shorter duration, may have a comparable effect to penicillin taken for 10 days. 
We summarized medical literature regarding the effect of two to six days of oral antibiotics (short duration) in treating children with streptococcal throat infection, compared with 10 days of oral penicillin (standard duration). We included 20 studies with 13,102 cases of acute group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) pharyngitis. The short duration treatment resulted in better compliance but more side effects. All side effects were self‐limiting: mostly mild to moderate diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Three studies reported the rate of long duration complications with no statistically significant difference. 
Our study has several limitations. Firstly, only 3 out of the 20 included studies followed the participants for a sufficient duration to be able to study the prevalence of complications of GABHS pharyngitis. Although these three studies had a total of 8135 participants, results were too under‐powered to draw any conclusions on differences in complication rates. This means our conclusion is not applicable in low‐income countries where the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease is high. Another limitation is that the primary studies evaluated different antibiotics for variable durations (three to six days). Also, studies were of limited quality. Finally, although the shorter antibiotic duration appeared to be effective and more convenient, it is more expensive than the standard duration 10 days of penicillin. However, one must take into account the reality of patient behavior and the price of unsuccessful or incomplete therapy. 
Three to six days of oral antibiotics for children with streptococcal throat infection is a safe treatment with a comparable effect to the standard duration of 10 days of penicillin. However, our results must be interpreted with caution in low‐income countries where acute rheumatic fever is still a problem.","# Plain Language Summary: Short vs. Standard Antibiotic Treatment for Strep Throat in Children

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether children with strep throat need to take antibiotics for the full 10 days, or if a shorter course (2–6 days) works just as well.

## Who was studied?

The review included 20 studies with over 13,000 children (ages 1–18 years) who had strep throat.

## What was tested?

Researchers compared:
- **Short treatment**: 2–6 days of newer antibiotics
- **Standard treatment**: 10 days of penicillin (the usual medicine)

## Main findings

**Shorter treatment worked better for:**
- Getting fever to go away faster (about half a day sooner)
- Reducing sore throat faster (about half a day sooner)
- Preventing early treatment failure (fewer kids needed additional treatment)

**No major difference in:**
- Whether the bacteria came back early
- Whether symptoms returned later
- Long-term complications like heart problems (very rare in both groups—only 14 cases total out of over 8,000 children)

**One concern:**
- Bacteria came back later more often with short treatment, but this mainly happened with one specific antibiotic at low doses

## What does this mean?

Shorter antibiotic courses (3–6 days) appear to work about as well as the standard 10-day course for treating strep throat in children. However, doctors should be cautious in areas where rheumatic heart disease is common.","**Summary of Clinical Trial on Treating Strep Throat in Kids**

**What's This About?**

Doctors usually treat strep throat in kids with 10 days of penicillin. This study looks at whether a shorter treatment (2–6 days) with newer medicines works just as well.

**Who Was Involved?**

The study focused on kids aged 1 to 18 with strep throat, using results from 20 different research studies.

**What They Did**

They compared short treatments with the usual 10 days of penicillin to see how well each worked.

**What They Found**

- Shorter treatments slightly reduced how long kids had fever and sore throats.
- Short treatments had a lower chance of early treatment failure.
- There was no big difference in how well the bacteria were cleared out early on or in cases where symptoms came back later.

However, bacteria were more likely to return later with shorter treatments, except when certain medicines were not considered. Long-term complications were similar for both treatment lengths.

**Safety and Results**

Overall, shorter treatments worked about the same as the standard 10-day treatment. But in areas where rheumatic heart problems are common, these results need careful consideration."
"Background
The optimal haemoglobin threshold for use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients remains an active field of research. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than in others because of inadequate testing for viral pathogens. If a liberal transfusion policy does not improve clinical outcomes, or if it is equivalent, then adopting a more restrictive approach could be recognised as the standard of care.  
Objectives
The aim of this review update was to compare 30‐day mortality and other clinical outcomes for participants randomised to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all clinical conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL). 
Search methods
We identified trials through updated searches: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2020), Embase (1974 to November 2020), Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to November 2020), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to November 2020), and trial registries (November 2020). We  checked the reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify additional trials. We were aware of one trial identified in earlier searching that was in the process of being published (in February 2021), and we were able to include it before this review was finalised. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised trials of surgical or medical participants that recruited adults or children, or both. We excluded studies that focused on neonates. 
Eligible trials assigned intervention groups on the basis of different transfusion schedules or thresholds or 'triggers'. These thresholds would be defined by a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) concentration below which an RBC transfusion would be administered; the haemoglobin concentration remains the most commonly applied marker of the need for RBC transfusion in clinical practice. We included trials in which investigators had allocated participants to higher thresholds or more liberal transfusion strategies compared to more restrictive ones, which might include no transfusion. As in previous versions of this review, we did not exclude unregistered trials published after 2010 (as per the policy of the Cochrane Injuries Group, 2015), however, we did conduct analyses to consider the differential impact of results of trials for which prospective registration could not be confirmed.   
Data collection and analysis
We identified trials for inclusion and extracted data using Cochrane methods. We pooled risk ratios of clinical outcomes across trials using a random‐effects model. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted predefined analyses by clinical subgroups. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as being in the 'restrictive transfusion' group and those randomly allocated to the higher transfusion threshold as being in the 'liberal transfusion' group. 
Main results
A total of 48 trials, involving data from 21,433 participants (at baseline), across a range of clinical contexts (e.g. orthopaedic, cardiac, or vascular surgery; critical care; acute blood loss (including gastrointestinal bleeding); acute coronary syndrome; cancer; leukaemia; haematological malignancies), met the eligibility criteria. The haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group in most trials (36) was between 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL.  Most trials included only adults; three trials focused on children. 
The included studies were generally at low risk of bias for key domains including allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data. 
Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving at least one RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts (risk ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.66; 42 studies, 20,057 participants; high‐quality evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I² = 96%). 
Overall, restrictive transfusion strategies did not increase or decrease the risk of 30‐day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15; 31 studies, 16,729 participants; I² = 30%; moderate‐quality evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed (i.e. cardiac events (low‐quality evidence), myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism (all high‐quality evidence)). High‐quality evidence shows that the liberal transfusion threshold did not affect the risk of infection (pneumonia, wound infection, or bacteraemia). Transfusion‐specific reactions are uncommon and were inconsistently reported within trials. 
We noted less certainty in the strength of evidence to support the safety of restrictive transfusion thresholds for the following predefined clinical subgroups: myocardial infarction, vascular surgery, haematological malignancies, and chronic bone‐marrow disorders. 
Authors' conclusions
Transfusion at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration decreased the proportion of people exposed to RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts. Across all trials, no evidence suggests that a restrictive transfusion strategy impacted 30‐day mortality, mortality at other time points, or morbidity (i.e. cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. 
Despite including 17 more randomised trials (and 8846 participants), data remain insufficient to inform the safety of transfusion policies in important and selected clinical contexts, such as myocardial infarction, chronic cardiovascular disease, neurological injury or traumatic brain injury, stroke, thrombocytopenia, and cancer or haematological malignancies, including chronic bone marrow failure.  
Further work is needed to improve our understanding of outcomes other than mortality. Most trials compared only two separate thresholds for haemoglobin concentration, which may not identify the actual optimal threshold for transfusion in a particular patient. Haemoglobin concentration may not be the most informative marker of the need for transfusion in individual patients with different degrees of physiological adaptation to anaemia. Notwithstanding these issues, overall findings provide good evidence that transfusions with allogeneic RBCs can be avoided in most patients with haemoglobin thresholds between the range of 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL. Some patient subgroups might benefit from RBCs to maintain higher haemoglobin concentrations; research efforts should focus on these clinical contexts.","Is it safe to use lower blood counts (haemoglobin levels) as a trigger for blood transfusion in order to give fewer blood transfusions? 
Key messages 
•There is no evidence that giving blood transfusions to patients with lower blood counts (haemoglobin levels of 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL) compared to higher blood counts (9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL) affects risks of death, heart attack, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, blood clots or infection. 
• Giving blood only to patients with lower blood counts (7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL) would reduce the amount of blood transfused substantially. It would also reduce the risk of unnecessary transfusions (transfusions can have harmful effects). 
• More research is needed to:
‐ establish the blood count at which a blood transfusion is needed in people who have suffered a heart attack, brain injury, or have cancer; and to 
‐ improve our understanding of outcomes other than death, including quality of life.
What happens in people who need blood transfusions? 
Doctors and healthcare professionals often give blood transfusions to people who lose blood through surgery, bleeding, or illness. For example, blood transfusions may help patients with anaemia to recover after surgery, but they should only be given when they help people to get better from their medical condition. Blood is a limited resource and transfusion is not risk‐free, especially for people in low‐income countries where the blood used in transfusions may not be tested for harmful viruses such as HIV or hepatitis. 
What did we want to find out? 
The blood count measures the amount of haemoglobin in the blood. Haemoglobin is a protein that gives blood its red colour and carries oxygen around the body. A normal blood count is around 12 grams a decilitre (12 g/dL). We wanted to find out if it is safe to withhold blood transfusion until the blood count drops to between 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL, rather than transfusing sooner at higher blood counts of between 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL. 
What did we do? 
We examined the results of studies that allocated patients to one of two groups by chance (for example, by flipping a coin). In one group, the patients only received blood transfusions if their blood count fell below a higher threshold (typically, 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL). In the other group, the patients only received blood transfusions if their blood counts fell below a lower threshold (typically, 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL). 
What did we find? 
We found 48 studies that involved 21,433 patients. The patients had been hospitalised for a range of reasons including: bone (orthopaedic), heart (cardiac) or vascular surgery; critical care; acute blood loss (for example, through bleeding in the stomach or intestines); heart diseases; cancer and blood cancers. The studies compared higher or lower blood count thresholds for blood transfusion. (The ‘threshold’ is the blood count level that would need to be met before a transfusion would be given.) 
Transfusion 
We found that patients who received transfusions only at lower blood count thresholds were 41% less likely to receive a blood transfusion than those who received them only at higher blood count thresholds. If the lower threshold were applied routinely by medical staff, it would lead to a substantial reduction in the quantity of blood needed. 
Death and harmful events 
There was no clear difference in the risk of dying within 30 days of receiving, or not receiving, a transfusion for patients in the two different threshold groups. 
There was also no clear difference between the low and high threshold groups for the number of serious harmful events that occurred after patients received, or did not receive, blood transfusions. The harmful events recorded included infection (pneumonia, wound infection, and blood poisoning), heart attacks, strokes, and problems with blood clots. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We found that most of the studies provided a high quality of evidence; they were adequately conducted and used methods that minimised biases that could make the validity of the results uncertain. 
We are confident in the evidence regarding likelihood of receiving a transfusion, death within 30 days of transfusion, heart attack, stroke and infection. We are moderately confident in the evidence for problems caused by blood clots, but too few occurred in either group for us to be more confident. 
Too few studies evaluated quality of life for us to be able to see whether it varied between groups. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
This Cochrane Review updates our previous work on this subject (last published in 2016). Seventeen new studies are included. The evidence is up to date to November 2020.","# Plain Language Summary: Red Blood Cell Transfusion Thresholds

## What is this study about?

This review looked at research comparing two different approaches to giving blood transfusions to patients. Researchers wanted to know whether it's better to give transfusions when a patient's blood count is lower (restrictive approach) or higher (liberal approach).

## Why does this matter?

Blood is a limited resource. In some parts of the world, blood transfusions can carry extra risks. If doctors can safely give fewer transfusions, that would be better for patients and help preserve blood supplies.

## What did researchers compare?

**Restrictive approach:** Give a transfusion when hemoglobin (a protein in red blood cells) drops to 7.0–8.0 g/dL

**Liberal approach:** Give a transfusion when hemoglobin drops to 9.0–10.0 g/dL

(Hemoglobin is a measure of how much oxygen-carrying protein is in the blood.)

## What did they find?

Researchers reviewed 48 studies involving 21,433 patients with different medical conditions (surgery, heart problems, bleeding, cancer, and others).

**Main findings:**
- Patients using the restrictive approach received **41% fewer transfusions**
- **Death rates were the same** in both groups
- **No difference** in heart attacks, strokes, blood clots, or infections between the two approaches
- The restrictive approach appeared safe across most patient types

## What are the limitations?

Some patient groups need more research, including those with:
- Heart attacks
- Brain injuries
- Certain blood cancers
- Chronic blood disorders

## Bottom line

For most patients, doctors can safely wait until hemoglobin drops to 7.0–8.0 g/dL before giving a transfusion. This reduces unnecessary transfusions without harming patients. However, some patients with specific conditions may need transfusions at higher blood count levels.","### Plain Language Summary

**Why This Study?**
Doctors want to know the best time to give blood transfusions to people with low blood levels (anemia). Blood is a limited resource and not always safely tested in every country. This study looked at whether giving blood transfusions earlier or later makes a difference in patient health.

**What Was the Study About?**
The study compared two ways to decide when to give a blood transfusion:
- **Restrictive Approach:** Give a transfusion when hemoglobin levels are between 7.0 and 8.0.
- **Liberal Approach:** Give a transfusion when hemoglobin levels are between 9.0 and 10.0.

**Who Was in the Study?**
The study included 48 different trials with a total of 21,433 participants. Most were adults with different medical conditions like surgeries, heart problems, and cancers.

**How Was the Study Done?**
Researchers collected data from many trials, checked the quality of the studies, and analyzed the results to compare the two approaches.

**What Did the Study Find?**
- Using the restrictive approach led to 41% fewer people needing blood transfusions.
- There was no difference in death rates within 30 days between the two approaches.
- The risk of other health problems like heart events and infections was not higher with the restrictive approach.

**Are There Any Risks?**
For some health issues like heart attacks or certain cancers, the study wasn't as sure about the safety of the restrictive approach.

**Conclusions**
Giving blood transfusions at lower hemoglobin levels can reduce the need for transfusions without increasing death rates or other serious health problems. More research is needed to understand specific health conditions and see if some patients might still need more blood to stay healthy."
"Background
Fetal growth restriction is defined as failure to reach growth potential and considered one of the major complications of pregnancy. These infants are often, although not universally, small for gestational age (SGA). SGA is defined as a weight less than a specified percentile (usually the 10th percentile). Identification of SGA infants is important because these infants are at increased risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Screening for SGA is a challenge for all maternity care providers and current methods of clinical assessment fail to detect many infants who are SGA. Large observational studies suggest that customised growth charts may be better able to differentiate between constitutional and pathologic smallness. Customised charts adjust for physiological variables such as maternal weight and height, ethnicity and parity. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of using population‐based growth charts compared with customised growth charts as a screening tool for detection of fetal growth in pregnant women. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (12 March 2014), reviewed published guidelines and searched the reference lists of review articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised, quasi‐randomised or cluster‐randomised clinical trials comparing customised versus population‐based growth charts used as a screening tool for detection of fetal growth in pregnant women. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion.
Main results
No randomised trials met the inclusion criteria.
Authors' conclusions
There is no randomised trial evidence currently available. Further randomised trials are required to accurately assess whether the improvement in detection shown is secondary to customised charts alone or an effect of the policy change. Future research in large trials is needed to investigate the benefits and harms (including perinatal mortality) of using customised growth charts in different settings and for both fundal height and ultrasound measurements","Customised versus population‐based growth charts as a screening tool for detecting small for gestational age infants in low‐risk pregnant women 
Small for gestational age (SGA) infants are defined as having a birthweight that is less than that for 10% of the population when plotted on a growth chart based on their gestational age and sex. This definition includes both infants who are normally grown but small, and infants who do not reach their full growth potential (are growth restricted). SGA infants are at an increased risk of complications, fetal distress and even death during labour. Detecting SGA infants is a major challenge for all maternity care providers, particularly with women who have an otherwise healthy pregnancy. 
Several clinical methods are commonly used for assessing an infant’s growth during pregnancy including estimating the size of the uterus by examining the pregnant woman (symphysiofundal height (SFH) and single or a series of ultrasound scans). 
Both of the above measurements can be plotted and followed on growth charts. Most maternity services use standard population‐based growth charts in assessing fetal weight during pregnancy, and monitoring changes from the birthweight after the baby is born. Previous research suggests that customised growth charts which adjust for factors such as the mother's weight and height, ethnicity and number of babies she has had may make assessment of fetal growth more precise, reducing unnecessary consultations for investigations and parental anxiety. 
Currently there are no studies available. Research is needed to assess the effect of using the charts in different settings and for both fundal height and ultrasound measurements on the health of women and their babies and should include important outcomes such as mortality.","# Plain Language Summary: Growth Charts for Pregnancy

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether special customized growth charts are better than regular growth charts for finding babies who are not growing well during pregnancy.

## Why does this matter?

Some babies don't grow as much as they should while still in the womb. Doctors call this being ""small for gestational age."" These babies can have more health problems after birth. Regular growth charts sometimes miss these babies.

Customized growth charts are adjusted based on the mother's size, background, and other factors. Scientists thought these special charts might catch more babies who aren't growing properly.

## What did researchers want to find out?

Researchers wanted to compare two types of growth charts:
- **Regular growth charts** (based on population averages)
- **Customized growth charts** (adjusted for each mother's characteristics)

They wanted to know which type helps doctors find babies who aren't growing well.

## What did they find?

The researchers looked for studies that tested both types of charts. **They found no completed studies that compared the two methods.**

## What happens next?

Researchers need to do large, well-designed studies to test whether customized growth charts actually help doctors find babies with growth problems better than regular charts. These studies should also check for any possible harms.","### Study Summary

**Purpose of the Study**
This study wanted to find out if using special growth charts that consider a mom's size, weight, and background is better than regular growth charts for checking how well a baby is growing during pregnancy.

**Who Was Involved**
The study looked for experiments where pregnant women were checked using either customised or regular growth charts. 

**Main Activities**
Researchers looked for different types of clinical trials to compare the two types of charts.

**Findings**
No suitable trials were found that compared the two methods.

**Conclusion**
We don't have enough information from trials yet to know if the special growth charts are better. More studies need to be done with larger groups of people to understand how these charts might help or if they have any downsides.

**Importance of Future Research**
It's important to continue research to see if these special charts make a difference in measuring baby growth safely and effectively."
"Background
Direct laryngoscopy is the method currently used for tracheal intubation in children. It occasionally offers unexpectedly poor laryngeal views. Indirect laryngoscopy involves visualizing the vocal cords by means other than obtaining a direct sight, with the potential to improve outcomes. We reviewed the current available literature and performed a meta‐analysis to compare direct versus indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, with regards to efficacy and adverse effects. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy of indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, versus direct laryngoscopy for intubation of children with regards to intubation time, number of attempts at intubation, and adverse haemodynamic responses to endotracheal intubation. We also assessed other adverse responses to intubation, such as trauma to oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal structures, and we assessed vocal cord view scores. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and trial registers (www.clinicaltrials.gov and www.controlledtrials) in November 2015. We reran the search in January 2017. We added new studies of potential interest to a list of ‘Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate them into formal review findings during the review update. We performed reference checking and citation searching and contacted the authors of unpublished data to ask for more information. We applied no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included only randomized controlled trials. Participants were children aged 28 days to 18 years. Investigators performed intubations using any type of indirect laryngoscopes, or videolaryngoscopes, versus direct laryngoscopes. 
Data collection and analysis
We used Cochrane standard methodological procedures. Two review authors independently reviewed titles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. 
Main results
We included 12 studies (803 children) in this review and meta‐analysis. We identified three studies that are awaiting classification and two ongoing studies. 
Trial results show that a longer intubation time was required when indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, was used instead of direct laryngoscopy (12 trials; n = 798; mean difference (MD) 5.49 seconds, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37 to 9.60; I2 = 90%; very low‐quality evidence). Researchers found no significant differences between direct and indirect laryngoscopy on assessment of success of the first attempt at intubation (11 trials; n = 749; risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.02; I2 = 67%; low‐quality evidence) and observed that unsuccessful intubation (five trials; n = 263) was significantly increased in the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group (RR 4.93, 95% CI 1.33 to 18.31; I2 = 0%; low‐quality evidence). Five studies reported the effect of intubation on oxygen saturation (n = 272; very low‐quality evidence). Five children had desaturation during intubation: one from the direct laryngoscopy group and four from the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group. 
Two studies (n = 100) reported other haemodynamic responses to intubation (very low‐quality evidence). One study reported a significant increase in heart rate five minutes after intubation in the indirect laryngoscopy group (P = 0.007); the other study found that the heart rate change in the direct laryngoscopy group was significantly less than the heart rate change in the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group (P < 0.001). A total of five studies (n = 244; very low‐quality evidence) looked at evidence of trauma resulting from intubation. Investigators reported that only two children from the direct laryngoscopy group had trauma compared with no children in the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group. 
Use of indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, improved the percentage of glottic opening (five trials; n = 256). Studies noted no significant difference in Cormack and Lehane score (C&L) grade 1 (three trials; n = 190; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21; I2 = 59%). 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence suggests that indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, leads to prolonged intubation time with an increased rate of intubation failure when compared with direct laryngoscopy (very low‐quality evidence due to imprecision, inconsistency, and study limitations). Review authors had difficulty reaching conclusions on adverse haemodynamic responses and other adverse effects of intubation, as only a few children were reported to have these outcomes. Use of indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, might lead to improved vocal cord view, but marked heterogeneity between studies made it difficult for review authors to reach conclusions on this outcome.","Comparison of video‐assisted and non‐video‐assisted devices for intubation of children
Background 
Children who need a general anaesthetic sometimes need a breathing tube placed in their throat, known as intubation. Intubations are also performed in emergency situations such as trauma, severe breathing difficulty, and heart dysfunction. Intubation is traditionally performed with a laryngoscope, a device that lifts the tongue to allow a direct view of the vocal cords. This is known as direct laryngoscopy. New devices have been developed that show the vocal cords through a fine video camera placed on the tip of the device; this is known as indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy. 
Indirect laryngoscopes, or videolaryngoscopes, are thought to provide a better view of the vocal cords when compared with direct laryngoscopes, but whether this equipment allows easier placement of the breathing tube remains unclear. 
Study characteristics 
We reviewed the evidence on how effective indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, is when compared with direct laryngoscopy for intubation in children from 28 days to 18 years old. We found 12 randomized controlled trials (803 children) that met our inclusion criteria. The evidence is current to November 2015. We reran the search in January 2017 and will include the three studies awaiting classification when we update the review. 
Key results 
For intubation, use of indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, took longer and was more likely to be unsuccessful (very low‐quality evidence). No significant difference was found between direct and indirect laryngoscopy when success of the first attempt at intubation was assessed (low‐quality evidence). Only a few studies reported the effect of intubation on adverse haemodynamic response, including changes in oxygen saturation, heart rate, and trauma to the mouth and windpipe. Therefore, it was difficult to conclude on the overall adverse effect (very low‐quality evidence). Indirect laryngoscopy might provide better views of the vocal cords. 
Quality of the evidence 
We found considerable variation in results from included studies in terms of assessment of intubation time, number of attempts at intubation, number of unsuccessful intubations, adverse effects, and assessments of how well the vocal cords were seen. None of the included studies was funded by a laryngoscope manufacturer, hence minimizing the risk of other bias. The quality of the studies varied, and only a few were of highest quality. For these reasons, we graded the overall quality of evidence as very low.","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Two Methods for Breathing Tube Placement in Children

## What is this study about?

This study compared two different methods doctors use to place breathing tubes in children's airways. Researchers looked at studies to see which method works better and causes fewer problems.

## The Two Methods

**Direct laryngoscopy:** The doctor looks directly down the child's throat to see the vocal cords and place the breathing tube.

**Indirect laryngoscopy (videolaryngoscopy):** The doctor uses a camera or special tool to see the vocal cords on a screen instead of looking directly down the throat.

## Who was in the study?

The review included 12 research studies with 803 children ages 28 days to 18 years old.

## What did researchers measure?

- How long it took to place the breathing tube
- How many tries it took to place the tube successfully
- Changes in heart rate and oxygen levels
- Injuries to the mouth and throat
- How well the doctor could see the vocal cords

## Main Findings

**Time to place the tube:** The indirect method took about 5 seconds longer than the direct method.

**Success on first try:** Both methods worked about the same on the first attempt.

**Failed attempts:** The indirect method had more failed attempts overall.

**Injuries:** Very few children had injuries with either method.

**Heart rate changes:** Some studies found the indirect method caused more heart rate changes after the procedure.

## Bottom Line

The direct method appears to work faster and with fewer failed attempts. However, the indirect method may give doctors a better view of the vocal cords. More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of each method.","### Plain Language Summary

**Objective**
This study looked at two different ways to help children breathe during surgery: direct laryngoscopy and indirect laryngoscopy (also called videolaryngoscopy). We wanted to see which method worked better and was safer.

**Who Took Part**
The study included children aged 28 days to 18 years who needed help with breathing during medical procedures.

**What We Did**
We compared the two methods by looking at:
- How long it took to help the child breathe.
- How many tries it took.
- Safety issues, like changes in heart rate or breathing problems.
- Any injuries in the mouth or throat.

**Main Findings**
- **Time and Success**: It took longer to use indirect laryngoscopy (around 5.5 seconds more) and it was harder to succeed on the first try compared to the direct method.
- **Breathing and Heart Rate**: Some children had trouble with low oxygen. Heart rates were higher for those using the indirect method.
- **Injuries**: Fewer injuries were seen with the indirect method, though both methods were generally safe.
- **View of Vocal Cords**: Indirect laryngoscopy gave a better view of the vocal cords.

**Conclusion**
Indirect laryngoscopy might take longer and may be harder on the first try, but it offers a clearer view of the vocal cords. More research is needed because the evidence was not very strong and varied between studies."
"Background
People who suffer from severe mental disorder experience high rates of unemployment. Supported employment is an approach to vocational rehabilitation that involves trying to place clients in competitive jobs without any extended preparation. The Individual placement and support (IPS) model is a carefully specified form of supported employment. 
Objectives
1. To review the effectiveness of supported employment compared with other approaches to vocational rehabilitation or treatment as usual. 2. Secondary objectives were to establish how far: (a) fidelity to the IPS model affects the effectiveness of supported employment, (b) the effectiveness of supported employment can be augmented by the addition of other interventions. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (February 2010), which is compiled by systematic searches of major databases, handsearches and conference proceedings. 
Selection criteria
All relevant randomised clinical trials focusing on people with severe mental illness, of working age (normally 16 to 70 years), where supported employment was compared with other vocational approaches or treatment as usual. Outcomes such as days in employment, job stability, global state, social functioning, mental state, quality of life, satisfaction and costs were sought. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (YK and KK) independently extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% (CI). We employed a fixed‐effect model for analyses. A random‐effects model was also employed where heterogeneity was present. 
Main results
A total of 14 randomised controlled trials were included in this review (total 2265 people). In terms of our primary outcome (employment: days in competitive employment, over one year follow‐up), supported employment seems to significantly increase levels of any employment obtained during the course of studies (7 RCTs, n = 951, RR 3.24 CI 2.17 to 4.82, very low quality of evidence). Supported employment also seems to increase length of competitive employment when compared with other vocational approaches (1 RCT, n = 204, MD 70.63 CI 43.22 to 94.04, very low quality evidence). Supported employment also showed some advantages in other secondary outcomes. It appears to increase length (in days) of any form of paid employment (2 RCTs, n = 510, MD 84.94 CI 51.99 to 117.89, very low quality evidence) and job tenure (weeks) for competitive employment (1 RCT, n = 204, MD 9.86 CI 5.36 to 14.36, very low quality evidence) and any paid employment (3 RCTs, n = 735, MD 3.86 CI ‐2.94 to 22.17, very low quality evidence). Furthermore, one study indicated a decreased time to first competitive employment in the long term for people in supported employment (1 RCT, n = 204, MD ‐161.60 CI ‐225.73 to ‐97.47, very low quality evidence). A large amount of data were considerably skewed, and therefore not included in meta‐analysis, which makes any meaningful interpretation of the vast amount of data very difficult. 
Authors' conclusions
The limited available evidence suggests that supported employment is effective in improving a number of vocational outcomes relevant to people with severe mental illness, though there appears to exist some overall risk of bias in terms of the quality of individual studies. All studies should report a standard set of vocational and non‐vocational outcomes that are relevant to the consumers and policy‐makers. Studies with longer follow‐up should be conducted to answer or address the critical question about durability of effects.","Supported employment for adults with severe mental illness
People with mental health problems experience high rates of unemployment. There are various schemes delivering support to people with mental health problems who are trying to find employment. Supported employment tries to place people into competitive jobs. People are placed quickly in normal work settings where they receive intensive support and training from ‘job coaches’.  Individual placement and support (IPS) is a more specified scheme that includes: finding local jobs; a rapid job search; customer choice in what they want from the employment service; close working between employment and mental health teams; attention to people’s preferred job, their strengths and work experience; ongoing and, if necessary, long‐term individual support; and the benefits of counselling. Employment specialists act to identify people’s job interests, assist with job finding, give job support and engage other support services. IPS uses assertive outreach to deliver training, advice and vocational support in the community. Augmented supported employment is where employment support is given with other supplementary techniques, such as social skills training, motivational classes and various types of rehabilitation. Other approaches are many and varied, including: job workshops; job counselling; peer support; partnerships with business; and the Clubhouse model, which involves training, work experience, peer support and transitional employment and IPS because they do not search for immediate and competitive employment. However, all approaches involve periods of preparation, education and on‐the‐job training.  This review compares supported employment and IPS with other approaches for finding employment. Drawing from a total of 2259 people with mental health problems in 14 studies, the review has two main findings: 1) Supported employment increases the length and time of people’s employment; 2) People on supported employment find jobs quicker. Supported employment and IPS are better than other approaches in these two respects, but there is limited information or measurable differences on other important issues for service users.  For example, there is little information on issues such as improving quality of life, impact on people’s mental health, days in hospital and costs. Furthermore, the review built its main findings on limited statistical evidence drawn mainly from studies carried out in North America and Europe. Future studies should address a fuller range of information and outcomes. Longer studies are needed to see how long the effects of supported employment last.

## What is this study about?

Many people with serious mental health conditions struggle to find and keep jobs. This review looked at whether a job support program called ""supported employment"" helps people with severe mental illness get work.

## How does supported employment work?

Instead of training people for months before looking for a job, supported employment helps people find real jobs right away. A specialist helps match the person with a job that fits their skills and interests, then provides ongoing support.

## What did researchers want to find out?

The main question: Does supported employment help people get jobs better than other job training programs or regular treatment?

Secondary questions: Does following the supported employment model closely make it work better? Can adding other types of help make it even more effective?

## How did they do this review?

Researchers looked at 14 studies involving 2,265 people with severe mental illness (ages 16–70) who wanted to work. They compared supported employment to other job training approaches or regular treatment.

## What did they find?

**Supported employment appeared to help:**
- More people got jobs (about 3 times more likely to find employment)
- People worked longer in competitive jobs
- People found their first job faster
- Jobs lasted longer overall

## Important notes

- The evidence quality was low, so results should be treated carefully
- Many studies had data that was hard to compare
- Researchers need longer studies to see if benefits last over time

## Bottom line

Early evidence suggests supported employment helps people with severe mental illness find and keep jobs, but more research is needed.","**Summary of the Study on Supported Employment**

**Background:**  
People with severe mental health challenges often have trouble finding and keeping jobs. Supported employment is a way to help them get into regular jobs quickly. The IPS model is a specific type of supported employment.

**Study Goals:**  
1. Compare how well supported employment works versus other job programs or usual treatments.
2. Explore if sticking to the IPS model or adding other help improves its success.

**Who Was in the Study:**  
The study looked at 14 different trials involving 2,265 people aged 16 to 70 with severe mental health issues.

**What They Found:**  
- Supported employment helped more people get jobs compared to other methods.
- It also increased the number of days people spent in jobs.
- Some studies showed that people in supported employment found jobs faster than others.

**Study Methods:**  
- Researchers used data from many places, including big databases and conferences.
- They looked at things like how many days people worked, job stability, and quality of life.

**Conclusions:**  
- Supported employment seems to help people with severe mental health issues find and keep jobs better than other methods.
- However, more studies with longer follow-up are needed to see how long the benefits last.

**Safety and Quality:**  
The evidence is not very strong, and more consistent data reporting is needed in future studies."
"Background
Congenital heart disease (ConHD) affects approximately 1% of all live births. People with ConHD are living longer due to improved medical intervention and are at risk of developing non‐communicable diseases. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is reduced in people with ConHD, who deteriorate faster compared to healthy people. CRF is known to be prognostic of future mortality and morbidity: it is therefore important to assess the evidence base on physical activity interventions in this population to inform decision making. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of all types of physical activity interventions versus standard care in individuals with congenital heart disease. 
Search methods
We undertook a systematic search on 23 September 2019 of the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, BIOSIS Citation Index, Web of Science Core Collection, LILACS and DARE. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and we reviewed the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) that compared any type of physical activity intervention against a 'no physical activity' (usual care) control. We included all individuals with a diagnosis of congenital heart disease, regardless of age or previous medical interventions.  
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (CAW and CW) independently screened all the identified references for inclusion. We retrieved and read all full papers; and we contacted study authors if we needed any further information. The same two independent reviewers who extracted the data then processed the included papers, assessed their risk of bias using RoB 2 and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. The primary outcomes were: maximal cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) assessed by peak oxygen consumption; health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) determined by a validated questionnaire; and device‐worn ‘objective’ measures of physical activity. 
Main results
We included 15 RCTs with 924 participants in the review. The median intervention length/follow‐up length was 12 weeks (12 to 26 interquartile range (IQR)). There were five RCTs of children and adolescents (n = 500) and 10 adult RCTs (n = 424). We identified three types of intervention: physical activity promotion; exercise training; and inspiratory muscle training. We assessed the risk of bias of results for CRF as either being of some concern (n = 12) or at a high risk of bias (n = 2), due to a failure to blind intervention staff. One study did not report this outcome. Using the GRADE method, we assessed the certainty of evidence as moderate to very low across measured outcomes. 
When we pooled all types of interventions (physical activity promotion, exercise training and inspiratory muscle training), compared to a 'no exercise' control CRF may slightly increase, with a mean difference (MD) of 1.89 mL.kg−1.min−1 (95% CI −0.22 to 3.99; n = 732; moderate‐certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of physical activity and exercise interventions on HRQoL. There was a standardised mean difference (SMD) of 0.76 (95% CI −0.13 to 1.65; n = 163; very low certainty evidence) in HRQoL. However, we could pool only three studies in a meta‐analysis, due to different ways of reporting. Only one study out of eight showed a positive effect on HRQoL. There may be a small improvement in mean daily physical activity (PA) (SMD 0.38, 95% CI −0.15 to 0.92; n = 328; low‐certainty evidence), which equates to approximately an additional 10 minutes of physical activity daily (95% CI −2.50 to 22.20). 
Physical activity and exercise interventions likely result in an increase in submaximal cardiorespiratory fitness (assessed with VO2 mL.kg‐1.min‐1 at the gas exchange threshold; MD 2.05, 95% CI 0.05 to 4.05; n = 179; moderate‐certainty evidence). Physical activity and exercise interventions likely increase muscular strength (measured by maximal voluntary contraction of knee extensions; MD 17.13, 95% CI 3.45 to 30.81; n = 18; moderate‐certainty evidence). Eleven studies (n = 501) reported on the outcome of adverse events (73% of total studies). Of the 11 studies, six studies reported zero adverse events. Five studies reported a total of 11 adverse events; 36% of adverse events were cardiac related (n = 4); there were, however, no serious adverse events related to the interventions or reported fatalities (moderate‐certainty evidence). No studies reported hospital admissions. 
Authors' conclusions
This review summarises the latest evidence on CRF, HRQoL and PA. Although there were only small improvements in CRF and PA, and small to no improvements in HRQoL, there were no reported serious adverse events related to the interventions. Although these data are promising, there is currently insufficient evidence to definitively determine the impact of physical activity interventions in ConHD. Further high‐quality randomised controlled trials are therefore needed, utilising a longer duration of follow‐up.","Physical activity interventions for people with congenital heart disease
Review question
This review aimed to gather evidence for the use of any physical activity intervention for people with congenital heart disease. We aimed to compare interventions including exercise training, physical activity promotion or lung training with no intervention (usual care). 
Background
Congenital heart disease is the term used for a range of birth defects that affect how the heart works. People with congenital heart disease have reduced life expectancy, physical fitness and quality of life. However, due to better prenatal diagnoses, surgical procedures (often performed in the early years of life) and earlier interventions, the survival rate for those born with this disease has improved dramatically, such that most people will now live into adulthood. Exercise training and physical activity interventions are known to improve fitness, physical activity, survival and quality of life in healthy people, but it is not clear how effective these programmes are for people with long‐term medical conditions. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies in September 2019 and identified 15 studies involving 924 participants. The studies used three main types of interventions, including programmes designed to increase physical activity, aerobic fitness and health‐related quality of life and compared physical activity intervention and control interventions in people with congenital heart disease.  
Key results
We included 15 trials with 924 participants. Half of the participants were female. Of the 15 trials, 5 used a total of 500 young people (less than 18 years of age) and 10 trials used a total of 424 adult participants. We found that physical fitness and physical activity may slightly increase but we are very uncertain about quality of life. There is currently no data to say if this small increase in fitness will result in fewer visits to the hospital. But there were no recorded deaths or serious events that were related to participation in physical activity. 
Quality of evidence
Using a validated scientific approach (GRADE), the certainty in the evidence base was moderate for fitness, low for physical activity and very low for quality of life. Most outcomes were limited due to small study participant numbers and poor reporting of study details.","# Plain Language Summary: Physical Activity for People with Heart Conditions Present from Birth

## What is this study about?

This study looked at whether exercise and physical activity programs help people who were born with heart conditions. Researchers reviewed 15 different studies involving 924 people to see if these programs were safe and helpful.

## Why is this important?

People born with heart conditions are living longer than before because of better medical care. However, they often have lower fitness levels and can get sicker faster than people without heart conditions. Staying physically active might help them stay healthier.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for studies that compared:
- **Groups that did exercise or physical activity programs** (like exercise training, activity coaching, or breathing exercises)
- **Groups that did not do special programs** (regular care only)

They looked at studies with both children and adults with heart conditions present from birth.

## What did they find?

**Fitness levels:** People who did exercise programs had slightly better fitness levels than those who didn't exercise. The improvement was small.

**Quality of life:** The results were unclear. Most studies didn't show that exercise improved how people felt or their daily life.

**Daily activity:** People who did the programs moved around a little bit more each day—about 10 extra minutes.

**Muscle strength:** Exercise programs helped people build stronger muscles.

**Safety:** Out of 11 studies that reported safety information, most had no problems. A few reported minor issues, but **no serious problems or deaths** happened because of the exercise programs.

## What does this mean?

Exercise programs appear to be **safe** for people with heart conditions from birth. However, the benefits are small, and more research is needed to know how much they really help.","### Plain Language Summary

**Purpose of the Study**
This study looked at how different types of exercise might help people with congenital heart disease (ConHD). The goal was to see if exercise is better than regular care and if it's safe.

**Who Participated?**
A total of 924 people with ConHD joined the study. They included both kids and adults.

**What Did the Study Do?**
Researchers compared people doing exercise programs to those not doing any extra exercise. They tried three types of exercise: promoting physical activity, exercise training, and breathing exercises.

**Key Findings**
- Exercise might slightly improve heart and lung fitness.
- Exercise had little to no clear impact on quality of life.
- People who exercised may have done about 10 more minutes of activity each day.
- Exercise likely made the muscles a bit stronger.

**Safety**
Out of 11 studies, 6 reported no negative effects from exercise. Five studies had some minor issues, but nothing serious or life-threatening.

**Conclusion**
Exercise may help in some ways and is generally safe, but more research is needed to know for sure."
"Background
Anthracycline‐containing regimens (ACR) are the most prevalent regimens in the management of patients with advanced follicular lymphoma (FL). However, there is no proof that they are superior to non‐anthracycline‐containing regimens (non‐ACR). 
Objectives
To compare the efficacy of ACRs to other chemotherapy regimens, in the treatment of FL. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2013), smaller databases, relevant conference proceedings (2004 to 2012) and the National Medical Library (April 2013). 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ACR with non‐ACR for adult patients with FL. We excluded trials in which immunotherapy, radiotherapy alone or stem‐cell transplantation were used in one arm alone. Our primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes included disease control, as measured by progression‐free survival (PFS) or remission duration (RD). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed the quality of trials and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We analyzed trials separately according to resemblance of the chemotherapeutic regimens in study arms, other than the addition of anthracyclines ('same' versus 'different' chemotherapy). Hazard ratios (HR) and risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated and pooled using the fixed‐effect model. 
Main results
Eight RCTs, conducted between 1974 and 2011, and involving 2636 patients were included in this meta‐analysis. All trials included therapy‐naive patients. Rituximab was used in one trial only. Follow‐up was between three and five years in most trials (range three to 18 years). All trials were published in peer‐reviewed journals. 
Five trials compared similar chemotherapeutic regimens, except for the anthracycline. In three studies reporting overall survival specifically in FL patients, there was no statistically significant difference between ACR and non‐ACR arms (HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.29; I2 = 0%). ACR significantly improved disease control (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.81; four trials). Progression or relapse at three years were reduced (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.85). Anthracyclines did not significantly increase rates of complete response (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.18) or overall response (RR 1.06; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12), but heterogeneity was substantial. 
Overall, ACR were more often associated with cytopenias, but not with serious infections or death related to chemotherapy. Cardiotoxicity, albeit rare, was associated with anthracycline use (RR 4.55; 95% CI 0.92 to 22.49; four trials). 
Three trials added anthracycline to one arm of two different regimens. None showed benefit to ACR regarding OS, yet there was a trend in favor of anthracyclines for disease control. Results were heterogeneous. 
We judged the overall quality of these trials as moderate as all are unblinded, some are outdated and are not uniform in outcome definitions. 
Authors' conclusions
The use of anthracyclines in patients with FL has no demonstrable benefit on overall survival, although it may have been mitigated by the more intense regimens given in the control arms of three of five trials. ACR improved disease control, as measured by PFS and RD with an increased risk for side effects, notably cardiotoxicity. The current evidence on the added value of ACR in the management of FL is limited. Further studies involving immunotherapy during induction and maintenance may change conclusion.","Anthracyclines in the treatment of follicular lymphoma (FL) in adults
FL is the most common indolent non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). It is a slowly progressive disease, with a risk of transformation to a more aggressive lymphoma. Advanced disease (stage III and IV) has been considered incurable. However, in recent years, the use of combination therapy and treatment with the monoclonal anti‐CD20 antibody rituximab, have prolonged survival and decreased transformation rate, and is now considered standard of care in FL patients. One of the most common chemotherapies used in the treatment of FL is the combination of rituximab with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, prednisone (R‐CHOP), which contains an anthracycline (adriamycin). Other anthracycline‐containing regimens (ACR) have also been used to treat FL patients. However, there is no proof that ACRs are better than non‐anthracycline‐containing regimens (non‐ACRs), and there are no standard guidelines for the initial treatment of advanced FL. Importantly, anthracyclines have serious side effects, notably a decrease in blood counts and potential damage to the heart, depending on the dose. 
The aim of this systematic review and meta‐analysis was to examine if there is a benefit in the use of anthracyclines for patients with FL. We looked at overall survival (OS); measures of disease control; response rates; and side effects. 
We found eight randomized controlled trials, of which five compared similar chemotherapy regimens in both trial arms, except for the anthracycline. Even among these five trials, three included more intense chemotherapy in the control arm. Most trials were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s. Only one of them included rituximab as part of the chemotherapy regimen. Almost all patients were treatment‐naive with advanced disease. Follow‐up ranged between three and five years in most trials. The main results from this set of trials are. 
1. There is no evidence that OS is prolonged with the use of anthracyclines, although it may have been hampered by the more intense regimens given in the control arms of three of five trials. 
2. Anthracyclines improved disease control. Concordantly, less patients progressed or relapsed within three years of treatment with ACR. 
3. There is no statistically significant difference in complete or overall response rates. 
4. Qualitatively, more side effects were reported with ACR, myelotoxicity and cardiotoxicity included. 
This evidence is limited, mainly due to disparities in regimens between control and study arms, but also since most included trials were conducted over one to two decades ago, and only one employed rituximab. Importantly, results from this study were in agreement with pooled‐outcomes from trials of the pre‐rituximab era. 
It is essential to find the optimal chemotherapeutic regimen in conjunction with rituximab and other novel agents, and understand the role of anthracyclines in this combination, especially with current methods that are able to reduce their toxicity. With longer follow‐up periods we may better understand whether improved disease control will eventually translate to an increase in survival.","# Plain Language Summary: Anthracycline Drugs for Follicular Lymphoma

## What This Study Is About
Researchers wanted to find out whether adding a type of chemotherapy drug called anthracyclines to cancer treatment helps patients with follicular lymphoma live longer. Follicular lymphoma is a type of blood cancer that grows slowly.

## The Question
Do treatment plans that include anthracyclines work better than treatment plans without them?

## How They Did It
The researchers looked at 8 studies from 1974 to 2011 that included 2,636 patients. They compared two groups: one that received anthracyclines plus other chemotherapy drugs, and one that received other chemotherapy drugs without anthracyclines. They looked for studies that tested these treatments in patients who had never received cancer treatment before.

## What They Found

**Living Longer:** Adding anthracyclines did not help patients live longer than other treatments.

**Controlling the Cancer:** Anthracyclines did help slow down cancer growth and delay it from coming back. Patients had a lower chance of the cancer getting worse in the first three years.

**Side Effects:** Patients who got anthracyclines had more blood cell problems. Heart damage was rare but happened more often with anthracyclines. There were no more serious infections or chemotherapy-related deaths in the anthracycline group.

## Bottom Line
Anthracyclines may help keep cancer under control for a while, but they don't help patients live longer. Because they can cause heart problems and other side effects, doctors need to carefully decide whether the benefits are worth the risks for each patient.","### Summary of the Clinical Trial

#### Objective
The study aimed to compare two types of chemotherapy treatments for people with a condition called follicular lymphoma (FL). One treatment includes a drug called anthracycline, and the other does not.

#### Study Details
- **Participants**: Adults with FL who had not received treatment before.
- **Types of Treatment**: Compared anthracycline-containing regimens (ACR) to other chemotherapy methods.
- **Main Focus**: To see if either treatment helped people live longer and to check how well the disease could be controlled.

#### Method
Researchers looked at multiple clinical trials from 1974 to 2011, including data from 2,636 patients. They checked different studies to see how the treatments worked.

#### Key Findings
1. **Overall Survival**: There was no clear difference between the two treatments in helping people live longer.
2. **Disease Control**: Anthracycline treatments were better at controlling the disease.
3. **Side Effects**: Anthracyclines sometimes caused more blood-related side effects and had a small risk of heart problems.
4. **Treatment Response**: Adding anthracyclines did not significantly improve complete treatment response.

#### Safety and Side Effects
- **Heart Problems**: Rare but more common with anthracyclines.
- **Blood Issues**: More common with anthracyclines, but no increase in severe infections or deaths from treatment.

#### Conclusion
Anthracycline treatments help control the disease better, but they also come with a risk of side effects. There's no clear proof that they help people live longer. More research, especially including new treatments like immunotherapy, is needed to understand if anthracyclines are worth the risks."
"Background
Constipation is a common symptom experienced during pregnancy. It has a range of consequences from reduced quality of life and perception of physical health to haemorrhoids. An understanding of the effectiveness and safety of treatments for constipation in pregnancy is important for the clinician managing pregnant women. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions (pharmacological and non‐pharmacological) for treating constipation in pregnancy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (30 April 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We considered all published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs and quasi‐RCTs, evaluating interventions (pharmacological and non‐pharmacological) for constipation in pregnancy. Cross‐over studies were not eligible for inclusion in this review. Trials published in abstract form only (without full text publication) were not eligible for inclusion. 
We compared one intervention (pharmacological or non‐pharmacological) against another intervention, placebo or no treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. 
Main results
Four studies were included, but only two studies with a total of 180 women contributed data to this review. It was not clear whether they were RCTs or quasi‐RCTs because the sequence generation was unclear. We classified the overall risk of bias of three studies as moderate and one study as high risk of bias. No meta‐analyses were carried out due to insufficient data. 
There were no cluster‐RCTs identified for inclusion. Comparisons were available for stimulant laxatives versus bulk‐forming laxatives, and fibre supplementation versus no intervention. There were no data available for any other comparisons. 
During the review process we found that studies reported changes in symptoms in different ways. To capture all data available, we added a new primary outcome (improvement in constipation) ‐ this new outcome was not prespecified in our published protocol. 
Stimulant laxatives versus bulk‐forming laxatives 
No data were identified for any of this review's prespecified primary outcomes: pain on defecation, frequency of stools and consistency of stools. 
Compared to bulk‐forming laxatives, pregnant women who received stimulant laxatives (Senokot or Normax) had an improvement in constipation (risk ratio (RR) 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21 to 2.09; 140 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence), but also had more abdominal discomfort (RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.15 to 4.73; 140 women, one study, low quality of evidence), and a borderline difference in diarrhoea (RR 4.50, 95% CI 1.01 to 20.09; 140 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence). In addition, there was no clear difference in women's satisfaction (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.46; 140 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence). 
One of the stimulant laxatives, Normax (dioctyl sodium sulphosuccinate and dihydroxy anthraquinone) is no longer used for the treatment of constipation in pregnant women (and the package information advises that it should not be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding). We therefore carried out a non‐prespecified sensitivity analysis with the data for Senokot and Normax presented separately. Results for Senokot and Normax were very similar, thus results for the individual drugs largely reflected findings for the combined analysis, although when individual drugs were compared with bulk‐forming laxatives there was no longer a clear difference between groups in terms of abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea. 
No usable data were identified for any of this review's secondary outcomes: quality of life; dehydration; electrolyte imbalance; acute allergic reaction; or asthma. 
Fibre supplementation versus no intervention 
Pregnant women who received fibre supplementation had a higher frequency of stools compared to no intervention (mean difference (MD) 2.24 times per week, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.52; 40 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence). Fibre supplementation was associated with improved stool consistency as defined by trialists (hard stool decreased by 11% to 14%, normal stool increased by 5% to 10%, and loose stool increased by 0% to 6%). 
No usable data were reported for either the primary outcomes of pain on defecation and improvement in constipation or any of this review's secondary outcomes as listed above. 
Quality 
Five outcomes were assessed with the GRADE software: improvement in constipation, frequency of stools, abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea and women's satisfaction. These were assessed to be of moderate quality except for abdominal discomfort which was assessed to be of low quality. The results should therefore be interpreted with caution. There were no data available for evaluation of pain on defecation or consistency of stools. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to comprehensively assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions (pharmacological and non‐pharmacological) for treating constipation in pregnancy, due to limited data (few studies with small sample size and no meta‐analyses). Compared with bulk‐forming laxatives, stimulant laxatives appear to be more effective in improvement of constipation (moderate quality evidence), but are accompanied by an increase in diarrhoea (moderate quality evidence) and abdominal discomfort (low quality evidence) and no difference in women's satisfaction (moderate quality evidence). Additionally, fibre supplementation may increase frequency of stools compared with no intervention (moderate quality evidence), although these results were of moderate risk of bias. 
There were no data for a comparison of other types of interventions, such as osmotic laxatives, stool softeners, lubricant laxatives and enemas and suppositories. 
More RCTs evaluating interventions for treating constipation in pregnancy are needed. These should cover different settings and evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions (including fibre, osmotic, and stimulant laxatives) on improvement in constipation, pain on defecation, frequency of stools and consistency of stools.","Interventions for treating constipation in pregnancy
What is the issue? 
The term 'constipation' is defined as difficulty in passing stool and reduced frequency of bowel movements. It is characterised by discomfort, excessive straining, hard or lumpy stools, a sensation of incomplete evacuation, and infrequent bowel movements. Constipation is a common symptom experienced during pregnancy. This can result from a combination of factors, including changes in hormones during pregnancy affecting the digestive system, reduced physical activity and changes in dietary habits during pregnancy. In addition, as the baby grows it can press on the mother's intestines and cause digestive delays/obstructions. 
Why is this important? 
Constipation during pregnancy is associated with impaired quality of life and distress for pregnant women as well as physical problems including, occasionally, haemorrhoids. There are a range of suggested treatments with drugs, supplements or dietary modifications. 
Generally, non‐pharmacological interventions (changes in diet, water intake and exercise) are recommended initially, followed by pharmacological interventions if the non‐pharmacological interventions fail or are insufficient. Pharmacological interventions include medications from a wide range of drug classes including lubricants, bulk‐forming agents, osmotic laxatives, stimulant laxatives, stool softeners, and enemas and suppositories. 
This review looked at the benefits of drug and non‐drug interventions for constipation in pregnancy and whether they are safe for women and babies. 
What evidence did we find? 
We identified four studies, but only two studies (with a total of 180 women) provided data for analysis.The studies looked at stimulant laxatives compared with bulk‐forming laxatives and dietary fibre supplementation versus no intervention. The included studies were judged to be of moderate quality. 
We looked at two main comparisons. In the first, we found that stimulant laxatives may be more effective in improving constipation than bulk‐forming laxatives (moderate quality evidence) but may also cause more abdominal discomfort (low quality evidence) and diarrhoea (moderate quality evidence) and we found no difference in women's satisfaction (moderate quality evidence). However, when we removed data relating to an intervention called Normax (dioctyl sodium sulphosuccinate and dihydroxy anthraquinone), which is no longer routinely used in pregnancy, there was no longer a clear difference between stimulant and bulk‐forming laxatives in terms of abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea. 
The second comparison, between fibre supplementation and no intervention, found that fibre supplementation may be effective in increasing the frequency of stools (moderate quality evidence). Fibre supplementation was associated with improved stool consistency as defined by trialists (hard stool decreased by 11% to 14%, normal stool increased by 5% to 10%, and loose stool increased by 0% to 6%). 
There were no studies that looked at others types of interventions like osmotic laxatives, stool softeners, lubricant laxatives and enemas and suppositories. 
What does this mean? 
What little evidence there is, suggests that dietary fibre supplementation may increase the frequency of stools. If choosing between stimulant and bulk‐forming laxatives, then stimulant may relieve constipation better but may cause more abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea. 
More research in this area is needed.","# Plain Language Summary: Treatments for Constipation During Pregnancy

## What is this study about?

Many pregnant women experience constipation (difficulty having bowel movements). This review looked at different treatments to see which ones work best and are safest during pregnancy.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for studies that tested different treatments for constipation in pregnant women. They looked for studies comparing medicines and other methods. They found 4 studies, but only 2 studies with 180 women had enough information to include.

## What treatments were tested?

**Two main comparisons:**

1. **Stimulant laxatives vs. bulk-forming laxatives** (140 women)
   - Stimulant laxatives (like Senokot) help move bowels by stimulating muscles
   - Bulk-forming laxatives (like fiber) make stool thicker

2. **Fiber supplements vs. no treatment** (40 women)

## What did they find?

**Stimulant laxatives worked better than bulk-forming laxatives:**
- More women had improvement in constipation
- BUT women had more stomach discomfort and diarrhea
- Women were equally satisfied with both treatments

**Fiber supplements helped:**
- Women had more bowel movements per week
- Stool became softer and more normal

## Important limitations

- Very few studies were available
- Study sizes were small
- The quality of evidence was moderate (meaning results should be interpreted carefully)
- No information about other treatments like osmotic laxatives or stool softeners

## Bottom line

There is not enough strong evidence to say which treatment is best for constipation during pregnancy. More research is needed.","### What Was the Study About?

This study looked at how well different treatments work for constipation during pregnancy and if they are safe. Constipation is a common issue for pregnant women and can make them uncomfortable.

### Who Was Involved?

The study included 180 pregnant women from two smaller studies.

### What Did They Do?

The researchers compared types of treatments:  
1. **Stimulant Laxatives vs. Bulk-Forming Laxatives**  
2. **Fiber Supplements vs. No Treatment**

### What Did They Find?

- **Stimulant Laxatives:**
  - Helped improve constipation more than bulk-forming laxatives.
  - Caused more stomach discomfort and possibly more diarrhea.
  - Women’s satisfaction didn’t change much between the groups.

- **Fiber Supplements:**
  - Increased how often women had bowel movements.
  - Made stool consistency better.

### Safety and Quality

- Some treatments could cause side effects like stomach pain.
- The quality of the evidence was moderate, which means findings should be taken with some caution.

### Conclusions

There is not enough strong evidence to fully understand which treatments are best for constipation during pregnancy. More studies are needed to explore other treatments and their effects. 

### What’s Next?

Researchers suggest doing more studies with different treatments for better understanding. This could help find the safest and most effective ways to relieve constipation in pregnant women."
"Background
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection that can lead to significant morbidity including stricture, abscess formation, fistula, bacteraemia, sepsis, pyelonephritis and kidney dysfunction. Mortality rates are reported to be as high as 1% in men and 3% in women due to development of pyelonephritis. Because probiotic therapy is readily available without a prescription, a review of their efficacy in the prevention of UTI may aid consumers in making informed decisions about potential prophylactic therapy. Institutions and caregivers also need evidence‐based synopses of current evidence to make informed patient care decisions. 
Objectives
Compared to placebo or no therapy, did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality, when used to prevent UTI in susceptible patient populations? 
Compared to other prophylactic interventions, including drug and non‐drug measures (e.g. continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, topical oestrogen, cranberry juice), did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality when used to prevent UTIs in susceptible patient populations? 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 21 September 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co‐ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of susceptible patients (e.g. past history of UTI) or healthy people in which any strain, formulation, dose or frequency of probiotic was compared to placebo or active comparators were included. 
Data collection and analysis
All RCTs and quasi‐RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at comparing probiotics to no therapy, placebo, or other prophylactic interventions were included. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. 
Main results
We included nine studies that involved 735 people in this review. Four studies compared probiotic with placebo, two compared probiotic with no treatment, two compared probiotics with antibiotics in patients with UTI, and one study compared probiotic with placebo in healthy women. All studies aimed to measure differences in rates of recurrent UTI. 
Our risk of bias assessment found that most studies had small sample sizes and reported insufficient methodological detail to enable robust assessment. Overall, there was a high risk of bias in the included studies which lead to inability to draw firm conclusions and suggesting that any reported treatment effects may be misleading or represent overestimates. 
We found no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI between patients treated with probiotics and placebo (6 studies, 352 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.12; I2 = 23%) with wide confidence intervals, and statistical heterogeneity was low. No significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI was found between probiotic and antibiotic treated patients (1 study, 223 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.33). 
The most commonly reported adverse effects were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, constipation and vaginal symptoms. None of the included studies reported numbers of participants with at least one asymptomatic bacterial UTI, all‐cause mortality or those with at least one confirmed case of bacteraemia or fungaemia. Two studies reported study withdrawal due to adverse events and the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event. One study reported withdrawal occurred in six probiotic participants (5.2%), 15 antibiotic participants (12.2%), while the second study noted one placebo group participant discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. 
Authors' conclusions
No significant benefit was demonstrated for probiotics compared with placebo or no treatment, but a benefit cannot be ruled out as the data were few, and derived from small studies with poor methodological reporting. 
There was limited information on harm and mortality with probiotics and no evidence on the impact of probiotics on serious adverse events. Current evidence cannot rule out a reduction or increase in recurrent UTI in women with recurrent UTI who use prophylactic probiotics. There was insufficient evidence from one RCT to comment on the effect of probiotics versus antibiotics.","Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in adults and children
Background 
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur in kidneys, ureters, urethra or bladder. UTIs are one of the most common bacterial infections and can lead to other health problems. 
Probiotics (live micro‐organisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host) are thought to work by preventing other infectious bacteria from climbing up the urinary tract and causing infection. We were interested in studying any form of probiotics (bacteria used to change balance of bacteria) compared with no treatment, antibiotics, hormone therapy, cranberry juice or other interventions in people at risk of UTI. To assess if probiotics were effective, we planned to measure how many people had recurrent UTIs. 
Study characteristics 
We conducted a literature search up to September 2015 and nine studies were eligible for inclusion according to our selection criteria. The nine studies reported data on 735 participants and investigated probiotics for preventing UTI: seven studies involved women or girls with recurrent UTIs, one looked at children with abnormal urinary tracts, and one investigated UTI in healthy women. 
Key results 
Generally, studies were poor quality with high risk of bias. Aside from the different populations, there were also many different species of probiotics used, different dosage forms such as vaginal and oral, and probiotics were given for varying lengths of time. All of these factors may have affected our results. 
Most studies did not collect information on adverse effects so we were unable to estimate any harms associated with probiotic therapies. We found no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI between patients treated with probiotics and placebo and no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI was found between probiotic and patients treated with antibiotics. 
Quality of the evidence 
The currently available evidence shows no reduction in UTI using probiotics.","# Plain Language Summary: Can Probiotics Help Prevent Urinary Tract Infections?

## What is this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if probiotics (good bacteria you can buy without a prescription) can help prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs are common infections that can cause serious health problems if they get worse.

## Who was studied?

The review looked at 9 different studies involving 735 people total. Most participants were people who had gotten UTIs before or were at risk for getting them.

## What did researchers test?

Researchers compared probiotics to:
- Placebo (fake treatment)
- No treatment at all
- Antibiotics (medicines that kill bacteria)

They wanted to see if probiotics could stop people from getting UTIs again.

## What did they find?

**Main finding:** Probiotics did not work better than placebo or no treatment at preventing UTIs. The results showed no clear difference between the groups.

**Side effects:** Some people reported mild problems like diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or vaginal symptoms. Very few people stopped taking probiotics because of side effects.

## Important limitations

The studies were small and didn't always report their methods clearly. This makes it hard to trust the results completely. Researchers couldn't find enough information about serious side effects or deaths.

## Bottom line

There is not enough good evidence to say probiotics help prevent UTIs. However, researchers also cannot completely rule out that they might help. More and better studies are needed.","### Plain Language Summary

**Purpose of the Study:**

This study looked at whether taking probiotics could help prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in people who are likely to get them. Researchers compared probiotics to doing nothing, taking a placebo (a fake treatment), and other prevention methods like antibiotics, creams, and cranberry juice.

**Who Was Involved:**

The study included 735 people who either had a history of UTIs or were healthy. These participants were part of nine different studies.

**What Was Done:**

- Four studies compared probiotics to a placebo.
- Two studies compared probiotics to no treatment.
- Two studies compared probiotics to antibiotics for people with UTIs.
- One study compared probiotics to a placebo in healthy women.

**Findings:**

- Probiotics did not significantly reduce the chance of getting another UTI compared to a placebo.
- When compared to antibiotics, probiotics also did not show a significant difference.
- Some people experienced side effects like diarrhea, nausea, and constipation.

**Safety:**

- There were reports of side effects, but serious problems were not commonly mentioned.
- Some participants stopped the study due to side effects, especially in the antibiotic group.

**Conclusion:**

The study did not find a clear benefit of probiotics for preventing UTIs. However, because the studies were small and not very detailed, we can't be sure if probiotics help or not. More research is needed to know for sure if probiotics can reduce UTIs or if they have serious side effects."
"Background
Opioid dependence (OD) is an increasing clinical and public health problem worldwide. International guidelines recommend opioid substitution treatment (OST), such as methadone and buprenorphine, as first‐line medication treatment for OD. A negative aspect of OST is that the medication used can be diverted both through sale on the black market, and the unsanctioned use of medications. Daily supervised administration of medications used in OST has the advantage of reducing the risk of diversion, and may promote therapeutic engagement, potentially enhancing the psychosocial aspect of OST, but costs more and is more restrictive on the client than dispensing for off‐site consumption. 
Objectives
The objective of this systematic review is to compare the effectiveness of OST with supervised dosing relative to dispensing of medication for off‐site consumption. 
Search methods
We searched in Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science from inception up to April 2016. Ongoing and unpublished studies were searched via ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/). 
All searches included non‐English language literature. We handsearched references on topic‐related systematic reviews. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), and prospective controlled cohort studies, involving people who are receiving OST (methadone, buprenorphine) and comparing supervised dosing with dispensing of medication to be consumed away from the dispensing point, usually without supervision. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
Six studies (four RCTs and two prospective observational cohort studies), involving 7999 participants comparing supervised OST treatment with unsupervised treatment, met the inclusion criteria. The risk of bias was generally moderate across trials, but the results reported on outcomes that we planned to consider were limited. Overall, we judged the quality of the evidence from very low to low for all the outcomes. 
We found no difference in retention at any duration with supervised compared to unsupervised dosing (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12, 716 participants, four trials, low‐quality evidence) or in retention in the shortest follow‐up period, three months (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.05; 472 participants, three trials, low‐quality evidence). Additional data at 12 months from one observational study found no difference in retention between groups (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.14; n = 300).There was no difference in abstinence at the end of treatment (self‐reported drug use) (67% versus 60%, P = 0.33, 293 participants, one trial, very low‐quality evidence); and in diversion of medication (5% versus 2%, 293 participants, one trial, very low‐quality evidence). 
Regarding our secondary outcomes, we did not found a difference in the incidence of adverse effects in the supervised compared to unsupervised control group (RR 0.63; 96% CI 0.10 to 3.86; 363 participants, two trials, very low‐quality evidence). Data on severity of dependence were very limited (244 participants, one trial) and showed no difference between the two approaches. Data on deaths were reported in two studies. One trial reported two deaths in the supervised group (low‐quality evidence), while in the cohort study all‐cause mortality was found lower in regular supervision group (crude mortality rate 0.60 versus 0.81 per 100 person‐years), although after adjustment insufficient evidence existed to suggest that regular supervision was protective (mortality rate ratio = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.67 to 2.27). 
No studies reported pain symptoms, drug craving, aberrant opioid‐related behaviours, days of unsanctioned opioid use and overdose. 
Authors' conclusions
Take‐home medication strategies are attractive to treatment services due to lower costs, and place less restrictions on clients, but it is unknown whether they may be associated with increased risk of diversion and unsanctioned use of medication. There is uncertainty about the effects of supervised dosing compared with unsupervised medication due to the low and very low quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes of interest for this review. Data on defined secondary outcomes were similarly limited. More research comparing supervised and take‐home medication strategies is needed to support decisions on the relative effectiveness of these strategies. The trials should be designed and conducted with high quality and over a longer follow‐up period to support comparison of strategies at different stages of treatment. In particular, there is a need for studies assessing in more detail the risk of diversion and safety outcomes of using supervised OST to manage opioid dependence.","Supervised‐dosing strategies versus take‐home opioid substitution treatment for people dependent on opioid drugs 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of supervised dosing strategies in opioid substitution treatment for people dependent on opioid drugs. 
Background 
Opioid dependence (OD) is a global clinical and public health problem that is associated with significant burden of disease and drug‐related deaths. OD represents a complex health condition that usually requires long‐term treatment. International guidelines recommend opioid substitution treatment (OST), such as methadone and buprenorphine, as a first‐line treatment for OD. OST is a form of health care for people who are dependent on heroin, or who have become dependent after taking prescribed opioids for pain, and involves substitution of the drug that is being used inappropriately with a long‐acting opioid. OST gives people who are opioid dependent the opportunity to stabilise their lives, and to address the social and psychological dimensions that tend to accompany opioid dependence. A negative aspect of OST is that the medications used can be diverted, by being sold on the black market or used inappropriately. One strategy for minimising diversion is for OST medications to be administered under supervision (supervised dosing). With supervised dosing, access to unsupervised or take‐away doses of medication is then a privilege which can be used as a motivational and reward incentive. Supervised dosing is also associated with more frequent contact between the client and service provider offering more opportunities for therapeutic engagement. However, providing supervised dosing is more expensive for service providers, and more restrictive for clients who have to attend for dosing every day. The purpose of this review was to assess the effectiveness of supervised dosing, compared to dispensing of take‐home medication, in terms of reduction in heroin and other unsanctioned opioid use, retention in treatment, diversion of medication and adverse effects. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to April 2016.
Study characteristics 
We identified six studies involving 7999 people receiving treatment with methadone (7786 people) or buprenorphine–naloxone (213 people ) for opioid dependence. Four of the studies were randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), while the other two studies followed groups of people over time. Four of the studies were funded by the National Institutes for Health Research and by the Health Research Board, with one study not reporting the funding source. One study was also funded by the drug company of buprenorphine–naloxone. 
Key results 
At three or more months follow‐up, this review found no evidence on benefit of the supervised dosing with respect to keep people in treatment, or reduce opioid use, mortality reduction and adverse drug events. One study found that supervised dosing led to a reduction of diversion. None of the studies assessed the effect of supervised dosing on pain symptoms, drug craving, days of unsanctioned opioid use, overdose and hospitalisation. 
We are unable to make any conclusion about the effectiveness of supervised dosing compared to dispensing of medication as take‐home doses, in the context of OST. Further research is required to determine the effectiveness of supervised or take‐home dosing in OST. 
Quality of the evidence 
Overall, the studies were moderately well‐conducted, but there was a small number of studies reporting outcomes of interest, therefore insufficient to evaluate the efficacy of intervention such as diversion, opoid use reduction, retention in treatment and frequency of unsanctioned opioid use, Furthermore, low rates of occurrence of some events between studies resulted in the overall quality of the evidence being assessed as low and very low. This indicates that further evidence would be likely to change the estimates of relative effect made in this review.","# Plain Language Summary: Supervised vs. Take-Home Medication for Opioid Treatment

## What is this study about?

This review looked at two ways to give medication to people being treated for opioid dependence (addiction to opioids like heroin or prescription painkillers). The two methods are:
- **Supervised dosing**: People come to a clinic every day to take their medication under supervision
- **Take-home medication**: People receive medication to take at home on their own

## Why does this matter?

Opioid addiction is a serious problem worldwide. Doctors recommend using medications like methadone or buprenorphine to help people. However, there are pros and cons to each method:

- **Supervised dosing** costs more money and is less convenient, but it may prevent people from selling or misusing their medication
- **Take-home medication** costs less and gives people more freedom, but there's a concern that people might misuse or sell the medication

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for studies that compared these two methods. They found 6 studies involving nearly 8,000 people that met their requirements.

## What did they find?

**Main findings:**
- Both methods kept people in treatment equally well
- Both methods helped people stop using drugs about the same amount
- There was little difference in medication being misused or sold (5% vs. 2%)
- Both methods had similar side effects

**Important note:** The researchers said the quality of evidence was low, meaning we can't be completely sure about these results.

## What do the researchers recommend?

More and better research is needed to understand which method works best. Future studies should:
- Last longer to see long-term results
- Look more carefully at medication misuse and safety
- Be designed with higher quality methods","### Study Summary on Opioid Substitution Treatments

**Purpose of the Study:**
This study looked at two ways of treating people who are dependent on opioids. The goal was to see if taking medication under supervision is more effective than taking it at home.

**Who Was Studied:**
The study included different trials and observed 7,999 people who were already receiving opioid treatments like methadone and buprenorphine.

**Methods:**
Researchers compared two groups:
1. People who took their medication in front of a supervisor.
2. People who took their medication at home without supervision.

**Key Findings:**
- There was no major difference in how long people stayed in treatment whether they were supervised or not.
- Both groups had similar reports of continuing drug use.
- Medication misuse was low in both groups.
- No significant differences in safety or side effects were noticed between the two groups.

**Quality of Evidence:**
The overall quality of the evidence was considered low, meaning that the results are not very strong.

**Conclusion:**
Both supervised and unsupervised treatments have their pros and cons. Supervised treatments might reduce misuse, but they are more expensive and less convenient. More research is needed to understand these treatments better, especially to ensure safety and effectiveness over a longer time.

**Recommendations:**
Future studies should focus on the safety and risk of medication misuse, and should be planned with better methods to get clearer results."
"Background
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a disease that causes progressive or relapsing and remitting weakness and numbness. It is probably caused by an autoimmune process. Immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs would be expected to be beneficial. This review was first published in 2003 and has been updated most recently in 2016. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive agents other than corticosteroids, immunoglobulin, and plasma exchange in CIDP. 
Search methods
On 24 May 2016, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 4) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and LILACS for completed trials, and clinical trial registers for ongoing trials. We contacted the authors of the trials identified and other disease experts seeking other published and unpublished trials. 
Selection criteria
We sought randomised and quasi‐randomised trials of all immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil, and rituximab, and all immunomodulatory agents, such as interferon (IFN) alfa and IFN beta, in participants fulfilling standard diagnostic criteria for CIDP. We included all comparisons of these agents with placebo, another treatment, or no treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We wanted to measure the change in disability after one year as our primary outcome. Our secondary outcomes were change in disability after four or more weeks (from randomisation); change in impairment after at least one year; change in maximum motor nerve conduction velocity and compound muscle action potential amplitude after one year; and for participants who were receiving corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), the amount of this medication given during at least one year after randomisation. Participants with one or more serious adverse events during the first year was also a secondary outcome. 
Main results
Four trials fulfilled the selection criteria: one of azathioprine (27 participants), two of IFN beta‐1a (77 participants in total) and one of methotrexate (60 participants). The risk of bias was considered low in the trials of IFN beta‐1a and methotrexate but high in the trial of azathioprine. None of the trials showed significant benefit in any of the outcomes selected by their authors. The results of the outcomes which approximated most closely to the primary outcome for this review were as follows. 
In the azathioprine trial there was a median improvement in the Neuropathy Impairment Scale (scale range 0 to 280) after nine months of 29 points (range 49 points worse to 84 points better) in the azathioprine and prednisone treated participants compared with 30 points worse (range 20 points worse to 104 points better) in the prednisone alone group. There were no reports of adverse events. 
In a cross‐over trial of IFN beta‐1a with 20 participants, the treatment periods were 12 weeks. The median improvement in the Guy's Neurological Disability Scale (range 1 to 10) was 0.5 grades (interquartile range (IQR) 1.8 grades better to zero grade change) in the IFN beta‐1a treatment period and 0.5 grades (IQR 1.8 grades better to 1.0 grade worse) in the placebo treatment period. There were no serious adverse events in either treatment period. 
In a parallel group trial of IFN beta‐1a with 67 participants, none of the outcomes for this review was available. The trial design involved withdrawal from ongoing IVIg treatment. The primary outcome used by the trial authors was total IVIg dose administered from week 16 to week 32 in the placebo group compared with the IFN beta‐1a groups. This was slightly but not significantly lower in the combined IFN beta‐1a groups (1.20 g/kg) compared with the placebo group (1.34 g/kg, P = 0.75). There were four participants in the IFN beta‐1a group and none in the placebo group with one or more serious adverse events, risk ratio (RR) 4.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 80.05). 
The methotrexate trial had a similar design involving withdrawal from ongoing corticosteroid or IVIg treatment. At the end of the trial (approximately 40 weeks) there was no significant difference in the change in the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale, a disability scale (scale range 0 to 12), the median change being 0 (IQR −1 to 0) in the methotrexate group and 0 (IQR −0.75 to 0) in the placebo group. These changes in disability might have been confounded by the reduction in corticosteroid or IVIg dose required by the protocol. There were three participants in the methotrexate group and one in the placebo with one or more serious adverse events, RR 3.56 (95% CI 0.39 to 32.23). 
Authors' conclusions
Low‐quality evidence from randomised trials does not show significant benefit from azathioprine or interferon beta‐1a and moderate‐quality evidence from one randomised trial does not show significant benefit from a relatively low dose of methotrexate for the treatment of CIDP. None of the trials was large enough to rule out small or moderate benefit. The evidence from observational studies is insufficient to avoid the need for randomised controlled trials to discover whether these drugs are beneficial. Future trials should have improved designs, more sensitive outcome measures relevant to people with CIDP, and longer treatment durations.","Immune system treatments other than corticosteroids, immunoglobulin and plasma exchange for CIDP 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for giving people with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) treatment that regulates the immune system other than corticosteroids, immunoglobulin and plasma exchange. 
Background 
CIDP is an uncommon disease that causes weakness and numbness of the arms and legs. The condition may progress steadily or have periods of worsening and improvement. The cause is inflammation that damages the insulating layer (myelin) around individual nerve fibres. In severe cases, the disease affects the actual nerve fibres themselves. According to Cochrane systematic reviews, three immune system treatments are known to help. These are corticosteroids ('steroids'), plasma exchange (which removes and replaces blood plasma), and intravenous immunoglobulin (infusions into a vein of human antibodies). However, benefit from these is often inadequate or does not last long. We wanted to discover whether other drugs that suppress or change the activity of the immune system are of benefit. 
Study characteristics 
We found four trials. A trial with 27 participants compared the effects of azathioprine together with steroids to steroids alone for nine months. Azathioprine is a drug that is often used to treat autoimmune diseases because it suppresses the harmful immune cells. This trial had a parallel‐group design, which means that the participants were divided into groups that each received only one of the treatments. 
A cross‐over design trial with 10 participants compared the immune‐regulating drug interferon (IFN) beta‐1a with placebo (dummy treatment) for 12 weeks. The cross‐over design means that all participants received both treatments in random order. A parallel‐group trial with 67 participants also compared interferon beta‐1a with placebo, but for 32 weeks. Another parallel‐group trial with 60 participants compared the cytotoxic drug methotrexate with placebo for 40 weeks. The IFN beta‐1a trials, but not the azathioprine or methotrexate trials, received pharmaceutical company support or sponsorship. 
Key results 
None of these trials showed significant benefit or harm from the drugs. We selected disability scores as our primary measure of the effect of treatment. All the trials were too small to detect or rule out anything but major benefit or harm. We rated the quality of the evidence as moderate or low for IFN beta‐1a and methotrexate because of problems with trial design, and because the small number of participants made the result imprecise. We rated the quality of the evidence for azathioprine as low because of lack of blinding and imprecision. Observational studies of these and other drugs, including the cytotoxic drugs cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, mycophenolate, rituximab, alemtuzumab and natalizumab, peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, and the immune regulating drug interferon (IFN) alfa, exist but are of insufficient quality to determine whether any of these treatments are beneficial. 
The evidence is up to date to May 2016.","# Plain Language Summary: Treatments for CIDP

## What is CIDP?
CIDP is a condition where the body's immune system attacks nerves, causing weakness and numbness that gets worse over time or comes and goes. Doctors think that medicines that calm down the immune system might help.

## What did researchers want to find out?
Researchers wanted to see if certain immune-calming medicines (other than steroids, immunoglobulin, or plasma exchange) could help people with CIDP feel better and stronger.

## How did they search for information?
The researchers looked through medical databases and trial records up to May 2016 to find studies that tested these medicines in people with CIDP.

## What medicines did they study?
They looked for studies testing medicines like azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, and interferons (special proteins that affect the immune system).

## What did they find?
Researchers found only four studies that met their standards:
- **One study** tested azathioprine in 27 people
- **Two studies** tested interferon beta-1a in 77 people total
- **One study** tested methotrexate in 60 people

**Main results:** None of these medicines showed clear benefits. People taking the medicines improved about the same amount as people taking placebo (fake medicine).

## What does this mean?
The current evidence doesn't show that these medicines work well for CIDP. However, the studies were small, so researchers can't completely rule out that these medicines might help. Better-designed studies with more people and longer treatment periods are needed.","### Plain Language Summary

**Purpose of the Study**

This study looked at how certain medicines might help people with a condition that causes weakness and numbness. The medicines tested weren't the usual ones like steroids or special treatments that filter the blood. 

**What Was Done**

Researchers checked different medical databases and spoke to experts to find studies about these medicines. They focused on medicines like azathioprine, methotrexate, and interferon beta.

**Who Was Studied**

The study included people diagnosed with the condition we mentioned above. They tried different medicines or were given a fake treatment (called a placebo).

**What Researchers Measured**

The main thing they looked at was how disability changed after one year. They also looked at nerve function, medicine usage, and any serious health issues during the first year.

**Results**

- **Azathioprine:** This study involved 27 people. There was some improvement, but it wasn't clear if it was due to the medicine. There were no major side effects reported.

- **Interferon beta:** There were two trials. One had 20 people and showed a small change, but again, it was unclear if the medicine helped. No serious side effects were found. The other trial had 67 people and focused on how much of another treatment they needed. It showed no major benefits and some people had serious side effects.

- **Methotrexate:** Involved 60 people. No major improvements were seen. Some participants had serious side effects. 

**Conclusion**

The studies didn't show clear benefits from these medicines. The trials were too small to be sure about any small effects. More research with better designs and longer treatment times is needed to see if these medicines help people with this condition."
"Background
People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are confronted with a number of important uncertainties concerning many aspects of the disease. These include diagnosis, prognosis, disease course, disease‐modifying therapies, symptomatic therapies, and non‐pharmacological interventions, among others. While people with MS demand adequate information to be able to actively participate in medical decision making and to self manage their disease, it has been shown that patients’ disease‐related knowledge is poor, therefore guidelines recommend clear and concise high‐quality information at all stages of the disease. Several studies have outlined communication and information deficits in the care of people with MS. However, only a few information and decision support programmes have been published. 
Objectives
The primary objectives of this updated review was to evaluate the effectiveness of information provision interventions for people with MS that aim to promote informed choice and improve patient‐relevant outcomes, Further objectives were to evaluate the components and the developmental processes of the complex interventions used, to highlight the quantity and the certainty of the research evidence available, and to set an agenda for future research. 
Search methods
For this update, we searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Group Specialised Register, which contains trials from CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library 2017, Issue 11), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, PEDro, and clinical trials registries (29 November 2017) as well as other sources. We also searched reference lists of identified articles and contacted trialists. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐randomised controlled trials, and quasi‐randomised trials comparing information provision for people with MS or suspected MS (intervention groups) with usual care or other types of information provision (control groups) were eligible. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the retrieved articles for relevance and methodological quality and extracted data. Critical appraisal of studies addressed the risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, and detection bias. We contacted authors of relevant studies for additional information. 
Main results
We identified one new RCT (73 participants), which when added to the 10 previously included RCTs resulted in a total of 11 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria and were analysed (1387 participants overall; mean age, range: 31 to 51; percentage women, range: 63% to 100%; percentage relapsing‐remitting MS course, range: 45% to 100%). The interventions addressed a variety of topics using different approaches for information provision in different settings. Topics included disease‐modifying therapy, relapse management, self care strategies, fatigue management, family planning, and general health promotion. The active intervention components included decision aids, decision coaching, educational programmes, self care programmes, and personal interviews with physicians. All studies used one or more components, but the number and extent differed markedly between studies. The studies had a variable risk of bias. We did not perform meta‐analyses due to marked clinical heterogeneity. All five studies assessing MS‐related knowledge (505 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) detected significant differences between groups as a result of the interventions, indicating that information provision may successfully increase participants’ knowledge. There were mixed results on decision making (five studies, 793 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and quality of life (six studies, 671 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No adverse events were detected in the seven studies reporting this outcome. 
Authors' conclusions
Information provision for people with MS seems to increase disease‐related knowledge, with less clear results on decision making and quality of life. The included studies in this review reported no negative side effects of providing disease‐related information to people with MS. Interpretation of study results remains challenging due to the marked heterogeneity of interventions and outcome measures.","Information provision to help people with multiple sclerosis make informed decisions
Background 
People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are confronted with many uncertainties in all phases of the disease. For example, the significance of a diagnosis for the future disease course remains unclear, as up to one‐third of people will experience a benign disease course with little or even no disability progression. Uncertainty is also present for the effects and adverse effects of drug and non‐drug therapies. 
People with MS have the right and wish to receive accurate, recent, and relevant information in order to make informed choices on all relevant disease‐related decisions and also on personal life‐planning decisions. For this to occur, balanced information is a prerequisite. It has been shown that disease knowledge is poor in people with MS, therefore people with MS should receive interventions that provide information on all aspects relevant for them. 
Results 
We searched for relevant studies in the medical literature in November 2017 and identified 11 studies involving a total of 1387 participants. The studies evaluated a variety of approaches including the provision of written information or decision aids, coaching, educational programmes, and personal information. The quality of the study methods varied. Topics included disease‐modifying therapy, relapse management, self care strategies, fatigue management, family planning, and general health promotion. Five studies assessing level of knowledge showed that information may successfully increase patients’ knowledge (moderate‐certainty evidence). Five studies reporting on the effects on decision making (low‐certainty evidence) and six studies assessing quality of life (low‐certainty evidence) showed mixed results. As the studies and the interventions used differed markedly, and the certainty of the evidence for our outcomes was not high, our results prevented a clear conclusion about the effectiveness of information provision interventions for people with MS.","# Plain Language Summary: Information Programs for People with Multiple Sclerosis

## What is this study about?

People with multiple sclerosis (MS) often need better information to make decisions about their care. This review looked at research studies testing different ways to give people with MS better information about their disease.

## Who was studied?

The review included 11 research studies with a total of 1,387 people with MS or suspected MS. Most participants were between 31 and 51 years old, and most were women.

## What did the studies test?

The studies tested different ways to provide information, including:
- Decision aids (tools to help people choose treatments)
- Educational classes
- One-on-one talks with doctors
- Self-care programs

The information covered topics like disease treatments, managing relapses, managing fatigue, family planning, and general health tips.

## What were the results?

**Knowledge:** All five studies that measured whether people learned the information found that the programs worked—people who got the special information knew more about their disease.

**Decision-making:** Results were mixed. Some people made better decisions, but not all studies showed clear improvements.

**Quality of life:** Results were also mixed. Some people felt better, but the improvement wasn't clear in all studies.

**Safety:** No harmful side effects were reported in any of the studies.

## What does this mean?

Giving people with MS better information seems to help them learn more about their disease. However, it's not yet clear if this always helps them make better decisions or feel better overall. The good news is that providing information appears to be safe.","### Plain Language Summary

#### What Was the Study About?

This study looked at how giving information to people with multiple sclerosis (MS) can help them make better decisions about their health and improve their quality of life. MS is a disease that affects the brain and nerves, and people with MS often don’t have enough clear information about it.

#### What Did the Researchers Want to Find Out?

The main goal was to see if giving people with MS more information could help them know more about their condition. They also wanted to see how different ways of giving this information work and what future research should focus on.

#### How Was the Study Done?

The researchers searched many databases for studies that compared groups of people with MS who received extra information to those who received usual care. They looked for different types of trials and checked each study for quality and fairness.

#### Who Was Involved in the Study?

The study included 11 trials with a total of 1,387 participants. The average age of participants was between 31 to 51 years old, and most were women. The studies covered different topics like treatments, managing symptoms, and planning for families.

#### What Were the Key Findings?

- People who received extra information often knew more about MS compared to those who didn’t.
- However, results were mixed on whether this information helped people make better decisions or improved their quality of life.
- No harmful effects were found from giving people more information.

#### What Do These Results Mean?

Providing information can help people with MS learn more about their condition. It’s less clear if it helps with decision making or living a better life. The study suggests that more research needs to be done to understand the best ways to give this information.

#### Was the Study Safe?

Yes, the studies reported no negative side effects from giving more information to people with MS."
"Background
Gallstones are present in about 10% to 15% of the adult western population. Between 1% and 4% of these adults become symptomatic in a year (the majority due to biliary colic but a significant proportion due to acute cholecystitis). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis is mainly performed after the acute cholecystitis episode settles because of the fear of higher morbidity and of need for conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy. However, delaying surgery exposes the people to gallstone‐related complications. 
Objectives
The aim of this systematic review was to compare early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than seven days of clinical presentation with acute cholecystitis) versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (more than six weeks after index admission with acute cholecystitis) with regards to benefits and harms. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform until July 2012. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised clinical trials comparing early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy in participants with acute cholecystitis. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
Main results
We identified seven trials that met the inclusion criteria. Out of these, six trials provided data for the meta‐analyses. A total of 488 participants with acute cholecystitis and fit to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomised to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) (244 people) and delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC) (244 people) in the six trials. Blinding was not performed in any of the trials and so all the trials were at high risk of bias. Other than blinding, three of the six trials were at low risk of bias in the other domains such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting. The proportion of females ranged between 43.3% and 80% in the trials that provided this information. The average age of participants ranged between 40 years and 60 years. There was no mortality in any of the participants in five trials that reported mortality. There was no significant difference in the proportion of people who developed bile duct injury in the two groups (ELC 1/219 (adjusted proportion 0.4%) versus DLC 2/219 (0.9%); Peto OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.05 to 4.72 (5 trials)). There was no significant difference between the two groups (ELC 14/219 (adjusted proportion 6.5%) versus DLC 11/219 (5.0%); RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.61 to 2.72 (5 trials)) in terms of other serious complications. None of the trials reported quality of life from the time of randomisation. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of people who required conversion to open cholecystectomy (ELC 49/244 (adjusted proportion 19.7%) versus DLC 54/244 (22.1%); RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.25 (6 trials)). The total hospital stay was shorter in the early group than the delayed group by four days (MD ‐4.12 days; 95% CI ‐5.22 to ‐3.03 (4 trials; 373 people)). There was no significant difference in the operating time between the two groups (MD ‐1.22 minutes; 95% CI ‐3.07 to 0.64 (6 trials; 488 people)). Only one trial reported return to work. The people belonging to the ELC group returned to work earlier than the DLC group (MD ‐11.00 days; 95% CI ‐19.61 to ‐2.39 (1 trial; 36 people)). Four trials did not report any gallstone‐related morbidity during the waiting period. One trial reported five gallstone‐related morbidities (cholangitis: two; biliary colic not requiring urgent operation: one; acute cholecystitis not requiring urgent operation: two). There were no reports of pancreatitis during the waiting time. Gallstone‐related morbidity was not reported in the remaining trials. Forty (18.3%) of the people belonging to the delayed group had either non‐resolution of symptoms or recurrence of symptoms before their planned operation and had to undergo emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy in five trials. The proportion with conversion to open cholecystectomy was 45% (18/40) in this group of people. 
Authors' conclusions
We found no significant difference between early and late laparoscopic cholecystectomy on our primary outcomes. However, trials with high risk of bias indicate that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy during acute cholecystitis seems safe and may shorten the total hospital stay. The majority of the important outcomes occurred rarely, and hence the confidence intervals are wide. It is unlikely that future randomised clinical trials will be powered to measure differences in bile duct injury and other serious complications since this might involve performing a trial of more than 50,000 people, but several smaller randomised trials may answer the questions through meta‐analyses.","Early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people with acute cholecystitis
The liver produces bile which has many functions including elimination of waste processed by the liver and digestion of fat. The bile is temporarily stored in the gallbladder (an organ situated underneath the liver) before it reaches the small bowel. Concretions in the gallbladder are called gallstones. Gallstones are present in about 10% to 15% of the adult western population. Between 1% and 4% become symptomatic in a year. The symptoms include pain related to the gallbladder (biliary colic), inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), obstruction to the flow of bile from the liver and gallbladder into the small bowel resulting in jaundice (yellowish discolourisation of the body usually most prominently noticed in the white of the eye, which turns yellow), bile infection (cholangitis), and inflammation of the pancreas, an organ which secretes digestive juices and harbours the insulin secreting cells which maintain blood sugar level (pancreatitis). Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is currently considered the best treatment option for people with symptomatic gallstones. This is generally performed by key‐hole surgery (laparoscopic cholecystectomy). Cholecystitis (inflammation) of the gallbladder is one of the indications for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Cholecystitis can occur suddenly, with symptoms such as fever along with intense pain in the right upper tummy. This is called acute cholecystitis. In comparison, chronic cholecystitis is a smouldering inflammation of the gallbladder which presents with less intense pain in the right upper tummy. For many years, surgeons have preferred to perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy once the inflammation settles down completely (which usually takes about six weeks) because of the fear of higher complication rates including injury to the bile duct (a tube through which the bile flows from the gallbladder to the small bowel). Injury to the bile duct is a life‐threatening condition which requires urgent corrective operation in most instances. In spite of the corrective surgery, people have poor quality of life several years after the operation due to repeated instances of bile infection caused by obstruction to the flow of bile into the small bowel. Another reason for the surgeons' preference for delaying the operation is to avoid an open operation, as there has been a perception that early operation increases the risk of an open operation. However, delaying the surgery exposes the people to the risk of complications related to gallstones. The review authors set out to determine whether it is preferable to perform early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (within seven days of people presenting to doctors with symptoms) or delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (more than six weeks after the initial admission). A systematic search of medical literature was performed in order to identify studies which provided information on the above question. The authors obtained information from randomised trials only since such types of trials provide the best information if conducted well. Two authors independently identified the trials and collected the information. 
Six trials providing information on the review question were identified. A total of 488 people with acute cholecystitis were included. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed early (within seven days of people presenting to the doctor with symptoms) in 244 people while it was performed after at least six weeks in the remaining 244 people. The proportion of females ranged between 43.3% and 80% in the trials that provided this information. The average age of participants ranged between 40 years and 60 years. All the trials were at high risk of bias (and might have overestimated the benefits or underestimated the harms of either early laparoscopic cholecystectomy or delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy). All the people included in the trials were discharged home alive after operation in the five trials from which this information was available. There was no significant difference in the proportion of people who developed bile duct injury, surgical complications, or who required conversion from key‐hole to open operation between the two groups. None of the trials reported quality of life from the time of randomisation. The total hospital stay was shorter in the early group than the delayed group by four days. There was no significant difference in the operating time between the two groups. Only one trial reported the time taken for employed people to return to work. The people belonging to the early laparoscopic cholecystectomy group returned to work 11 days, on average, earlier than the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. Four trials did not report any gallstone‐related complications during the waiting period. One trial reported five gallstone‐related complications, including two people with cholangitis. There were no reports of pancreatitis during the waiting time. Gallstone‐related morbidity was not reported in the remaining trial. Approximately one‐sixth of people belonging to the delayed group had either non‐resolution of symptoms or recurrence of symptoms before their planned operation and had to undergo emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy in five trials. Based on information from a varied number of participants as well as trials at high risk of bias, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy during acute cholecystitis appears safe and shortens the total hospital stay. The majority of the important outcomes occurred rarely and hence one cannot rule out that future trials may show that one treatment or another may be better in terms of complications. However, the trial size required to show such differences involves a clinical trial on more than 50,000 people and so it is unlikely that such large trials will be performed. Several smaller randomised trials may answer the questions through meta‐analyses.","# Plain Language Summary: Early vs. Delayed Gallbladder Surgery

## What is this study about?

This study compared two different timing approaches for gallbladder removal surgery in people with acute gallbladder inflammation (acute cholecystitis). Researchers wanted to know whether it's better to perform surgery quickly (within 7 days) or to wait several weeks before operating.

## Why does this matter?

About 1 in 10 adults have gallstones, and some develop sudden gallbladder inflammation. Doctors have traditionally waited 6+ weeks to remove the gallbladder because they worried that operating quickly might cause more problems or require switching from minimally invasive surgery to open surgery. However, waiting puts patients at risk for additional gallstone-related complications.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers reviewed 7 previous studies that compared early surgery (within 7 days) to delayed surgery (6+ weeks after the initial episode). Six of these studies included a total of 488 patients—244 in the early surgery group and 244 in the delayed surgery group.

## What were the main findings?

**Safety:**
- No deaths occurred in either group
- Serious complications like bile duct injury were rare and similar in both groups
- About 1 in 5 patients needed conversion to open surgery in both groups

**Hospital stay:**
- Early surgery patients spent about 4 fewer days in the hospital

**Return to work:**
- Early surgery patients returned to work about 11 days sooner (based on limited data)

**Waiting period complications:**
- About 18% of delayed surgery patients had symptom return or worsening before their scheduled operation and needed emergency surgery

## Bottom line

Early gallbladder surgery appears safe and may reduce total hospital time. However, the studies had limitations, so researchers cannot make a definitive recommendation.","### Plain Language Summary

**Why the Study Was Done**

This study looks at the best time to do a surgery called laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people with a gallbladder problem called acute cholecystitis. Some doctors wait a while before operating, and others operate right away. The study compares these two approaches to see which one is better and safer.

**Who Took Part in the Study**

The study looked at 488 adults with acute cholecystitis who were healthy enough for surgery. About half were men and half were women, and their ages ranged from 40 to 60 years old.

**What Was Done**

Researchers compared early surgery (within seven days of symptoms) with delayed surgery (after six weeks). They looked at hospital stay, how often they needed to change the surgery to an open one, and any complications.

**What the Study Found**

- **Hospital Stay**: People who had early surgery stayed in the hospital about four days less than those with delayed surgery.
- **Complications**: There was no big difference in serious complications between early and delayed surgery.
- **Surgery Type**: About the same number of people in both groups needed the surgery changed to a more traditional, open type.
- **Return to Work**: One study showed that people who had early surgery went back to work sooner.
- **Waiting Issues**: In the delayed group, some people's symptoms got worse and needed emergency surgery.

**Safety and Outcomes**

Both early and delayed surgeries were generally safe, and there were no deaths reported. Both options had similar risks for things like bile duct injuries.

**Conclusion**

The study suggests that doing the surgery early might reduce hospital time without increasing risks. However, more research could give clearer answers, and smaller studies combined might help find out more."
"Background
Approximately 600 million children of preschool and school age are anaemic worldwide. It is estimated that half of the cases are due to iron deficiency. Consequences of iron deficiency anaemia during childhood include growth retardation, reduced school achievement, impaired motor and cognitive development, and increased morbidity and mortality. The provision of daily iron supplements is a widely used strategy for improving iron status in children but its effectiveness has been limited due to its side effects, which can include nausea, constipation or staining of the teeth. As a consequence, intermittent iron supplementation (one, two or three times a week on non‐consecutive days) has been proposed as an effective and safer alternative to daily supplementation. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of intermittent iron supplementation, alone or in combination with other vitamins and minerals, on nutritional and developmental outcomes in children from birth to 12 years of age compared with a placebo, no intervention or daily supplementation. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases on 24 May 2011: CENTRAL (2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1948 to May week 2, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 20), CINAHL (1937 to current), POPLINE (all available years) and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). On 29 June 2011 we searched all available years in the following databases: SCIELO, LILACS, IBECS and IMBIOMED. We also contacted relevant organisations (on 3 July 2011) to identify ongoing and unpublished studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials with either individual or cluster randomisation. Participants were children under the age of 12 years at the time of intervention with no specific health problems. The intervention assessed was intermittent iron supplementation compared with a placebo, no intervention or daily supplementation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria, extracted data from included studies and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. 
Main results
We included 33 trials, involving 13,114 children (˜49% females) from 20 countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia. The methodological quality of the trials was mixed. 
Nineteen trials evaluated intermittent iron supplementation versus no intervention or a placebo and 21 studies evaluated intermittent versus daily iron supplementation. Some of these trials contributed data to both comparisons. Iron alone was provided in most of the trials. 
Fifteen studies included children younger than 60 months; 11 trials included children 60 months and older, and seven studies included children in both age categories. One trial included exclusively females. Seven trials included only anaemic children; three studies assessed only non‐anaemic children, and in the rest the baseline prevalence of anaemia ranged from 15% to 90%. 
In comparison with receiving no intervention or a placebo, children receiving iron supplements intermittently have a lower risk of anaemia (average risk ratio (RR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 0.72, ten studies) and iron deficiency (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.91, three studies) and have higher haemoglobin (mean difference (MD) 5.20 g/L, 95% CI 2.51 to 7.88, 19 studies) and ferritin concentrations (MD 14.17 µg/L, 95% CI 3.53 to 24.81, five studies). 
Intermittent supplementation was as effective as daily supplementation in improving haemoglobin (MD –0.60 g/L, 95% CI –1.54 to 0.35, 19 studies) and ferritin concentrations (MD –4.19 µg/L, 95% CI –9.42 to 1.05, 10 studies), but increased the risk of anaemia in comparison with daily iron supplementation (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.04 to1.47, six studies). Data on adherence were scarce and it tended to be higher among those children receiving intermittent supplementation, although this result was not statistically significant. 
We did not identify any differential effect of the type of intermittent supplementation regimen (one, two or three times a week), the total weekly dose of elemental iron, the nutrient composition, whether recipients were male or female or the length of the intervention. 
Authors' conclusions
Intermittent iron supplementation is efficacious to improve haemoglobin concentrations and reduce the risk of having anaemia or iron deficiency in children younger than 12 years of age when compared with a placebo or no intervention, but it is less effective than daily supplementation to prevent or control anaemia. Intermittent supplementation may be a viable public health intervention in settings where daily supplementation has failed or has not been implemented. Information on mortality, morbidity, developmental outcomes and side effects, however, is still lacking.","One, two or three times a week iron supplements for improving health and development among children under 12 years of age 
Approximately 600 million preschool and school‐age children are anaemic worldwide. It is estimated that half of these cases are due to a lack of iron. Iron deficiency anaemia during childhood may slow down growth, reduce motor and brain development, and increase illness and death. If anaemia is not treated promptly, these problems may persist later in life. Taking supplements containing iron (sometimes combined with folic acid and other vitamins and minerals) on a daily basis has shown to improve children's health but its use has been limited because supplements may produce side effects such as nausea, constipation or staining of the teeth. It has been suggested that giving iron one, two or three times a week (known as 'intermittent' supplementation) may reduce these side effects and be easier to remember, and thus encourage children to continue taking the iron supplements. 
We analysed 33 trials involving 13,314 children (49% females) from 20 countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia, to assess the effects of intermittent iron supplementation, alone or in combination with other vitamins and minerals, on nutritional and developmental outcomes in children from birth to 12 years of age compared with a placebo, no intervention.or daily supplementation. 
The studies were of mixed quality. Overall, the results of this review show that giving children supplements with iron alone or in combination with other vitamins and minerals one, two or three times a week approximately halves their risk of having anaemia in comparison with receiving no iron supplements or a placebo. Giving children supplements on a intermittent basis was as effective as daily supplementation for improving haemoglobin and ferritin concentrations, although, children receiving iron supplements intermittently were at higher risk of having anaemia. 
We aimed to examine the effects of intermittent supplementation on illness, death, and school and physical performance, as well as on other side effects, but there was insufficient information to draw firm conclusions. 
In summary, intermittent iron supplementation is efficacious to improve haemoglobin concentrations and reduce the risk of having anaemia or iron deficiency in children younger than 12 years of age when compared with a placebo or no intervention, but it is less effective than daily supplementation to prevent or control anaemia. Intermittent supplementation may be a viable public health intervention in settings where daily supplementation has failed or has not been implemented. Information on mortality, morbidity, developmental outcomes and side effects, however, is still lacking.","# Plain Language Summary: Iron Supplements Given on Some Days vs. Every Day for Children

## What is this study about?

This study looked at whether giving children iron supplements a few days a week works as well as giving them iron every day. Iron supplements help prevent a blood condition called anemia, which affects about 600 million children worldwide.

## Why does this matter?

When children don't have enough iron in their blood, they may not grow well, do poorly in school, and get sick more often. Daily iron supplements can help, but they sometimes cause upset stomachs, constipation, or stain teeth. Scientists wanted to know if giving iron just a few days a week could work better and cause fewer side effects.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at 33 studies involving about 13,000 children from 20 countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Some children got iron supplements a few days a week, some got iron every day, and some got nothing or a fake pill.

## What did they find?

**Compared to no treatment:**
- Children who got iron a few days a week had much less anemia
- Their blood iron levels were higher

**Compared to daily iron:**
- Iron a few days a week worked about the same for raising blood iron levels
- But children getting iron a few days a week had slightly more anemia cases
- Children seemed to take their medicine more often when it was only a few days a week

## What does this mean?

Giving iron a few days a week helps prevent anemia better than nothing. However, giving iron every day works better than a few days a week. Iron a few days a week might be a good choice in places where children don't take daily supplements regularly.

## What's still unknown?

Researchers need more information about whether this approach affects children's growth, learning, and health overall, and about long-term side effects.","### Plain Language Summary

Many children around the world don't get enough iron, which can make them feel tired and affect their growth and learning. A lot of kids get iron every day to help with this, but it can cause problems like upset stomachs or other side effects. So, this study looked at giving kids iron just a few times a week instead.

**Study Goal:**  
The study tested if giving iron a few times a week helps kids grow and develop properly, compared to no iron or daily iron.

**Who Was Studied:**  
The study involved over 13,000 children from different countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. The kids were all under 12 years old, and some had anemia while others didn’t.

**Method:**  
Researchers compared kids getting iron a few times a week to those getting it every day or not at all.

**Findings:**  
- Kids who got iron a few times a week had less chance of being anemic and showed better iron levels in their blood.
- This method worked as well as giving iron every day when it came to increasing iron in the blood.
- However, giving iron every day was slightly better at preventing anemia.
- Children seemed to prefer getting iron a few times a week.

**Conclusion:**  
Giving kids iron a few times a week can help improve their iron levels and reduce anemia, making it a good option in places where giving iron every day isn’t possible. However, more information is needed about how it affects children’s overall growth and health."
"Background
Quadriphasic oral contraceptives have been developed to reduce the adverse effects of oral contraceptives and are presented as more physiological since they mimic the natural cycle. However, suggested disadvantages of quadriphasic oral contraceptives include a possible increased risk of pill‐taking errors caused by the array of different color pills, complicated directions for catching up when a pill is missed, the higher price and potential inferiority in terms of side effects. 
Objectives
To compare the contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding pattern, minor side effects and acceptability of quadriphasic contraceptive pills versus monophasic contraceptive pills. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, POPLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP for trials comparing quadriphasic pills with monophasic pills. We contacted researchers and manufacturers of quadriphasic oral contraceptives to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing quadriphasic with monophasic oral contraceptives. Trials had to report on contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding patterns, minor side effects, ease of use or trial discontinuation. We excluded studies where the intervention was primarily used as a treatment for disorders or was administered for fewer than three consecutive cycles. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors abstracted and entered data into RevMan. We critically appraised the methodological quality of the included trials. For continuous variables, we computed the mean difference with 95% confidence interval (CI) using the random‐effects model. For dichotomous variables, we calculated the risk ratio with 95% CI using the random‐effects model. 
Main results
We included one double‐blind, double‐dummy RCT comparing a quadriphasic oral contraceptive composed of dienogest and estradiol valerate with a monophasic oral contraceptive composed of levonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol. Contraceptive effectiveness, intracyclic bleeding and discontinuation due to side effects were similar for quadriphasic and monophasic pills. The number of women experiencing withdrawal bleeding was higher in the monophasic group compared to the quadriphasic group. Users of quadriphasic pills reported fewer bleeding/spotting days and fewer bleeding/spotting episodes than users of monophasic pills but the report did not specify whether the bleeding/spotting was scheduled or unscheduled. More women using quadriphasic oral contraceptives reported breast pain compared to women using monophasic oral contraceptives. 
Authors' conclusions
The available evidence is insufficient to determine whether quadriphasic differ from monophasic oral contraceptives in contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding pattern, minor side effects and acceptability. Studies that compare quadriphasic and monophasic oral contraceptives with an identical progestogen and estrogen type are needed to determine whether the quadriphasic approach differs from the monophasic approach. Studies that compare quadriphasic pills with monophasic pills containing 30 μg ethinylestradiol are indicated to determine whether quadriphasic oral contraceptives have an advantage over the current, first choice oral contraceptive. Until then, we recommend monophasic pills containing 30 μg estrogen as the first choice for women starting oral contraceptive use.","Birth control pills with three phases versus one phase
Standard birth control pills contain two hormones: progestogen and estrogen. One‐phase birth control pills contain the same dose of progestogen and estrogen every day. Four‐phase birth control pills contain different amounts of progestogen and estrogen on different days. This review looked at how well one‐phase birth control pills and four‐phase birth control pills work to prevent pregnancy, how often they cause bleeding problems, how often users experience side effects and how many women stop using the pills. 
We did a computer search for randomized controlled trials comparing four‐phase birth control pills with one‐phase birth control pills. We also wrote to researchers and makers of birth control pills to find other trials. Studies had to report on pregnancy, bleeding problems, side effects or stopping the use of pills. We did not include studies where the pills were used as a treatment for disorders like acne, hirsutism, polycystic ovary syndrome, bleeding problems or endometrioses, or where the pills were administered for less than three months. We assessed whether the studies were conducted properly. 
We included one study comparing a four‐phase pill composed of the progestogen dienogest and the estrogen estradiol valerate with an one‐phase pill composed of the progestogen levonorgestrel and the estrogen ethinylestradiol. Four‐phase birth control pills and one‐phase birth control pills had similar pregnancy rates. The number of women with blood loss in the period between two menstruations was similar for four‐phase pills and one‐phase pills. More women using one‐phase birth control pills had a menstruation compared to women using four‐phase birth control pills. The number of women who stopped using the pills because of side effects was similar for four‐phase pills and one‐phase pills. Breast pain was reported more frequently by women who used four‐phase birth control pills than women who used one‐phase birth control pills. 
The presence of only one study made it impossible to adequately compare four‐phase birth control pills with one‐phase birth control pills. More studies are needed to determine whether four‐phase pills have advantages over one‐phase pills. Until then, we recommend one‐phase pills containing 30 μg estrogen for women starting to use birth control pills.","# Plain Language Summary: Birth Control Pills Comparison Study

## What is this study about?

This study compared two types of birth control pills: **quadriphasic pills** and **monophasic pills**. 

- **Monophasic pills** have the same dose of hormones in every pill
- **Quadriphasic pills** have four different doses that change throughout the month (they're supposed to work more like a woman's natural cycle)

## Why does this matter?

Quadriphasic pills are newer and more expensive. They come in different colored pills, which some people think might be confusing. Researchers wanted to know if quadriphasic pills work better, cause fewer side effects, or are easier to use than monophasic pills.

## What did researchers do?

The researchers looked for studies that tested quadriphasic pills against monophasic pills. They searched medical databases and contacted pill manufacturers to find all available research.

## What did they find?

The researchers only found **one good quality study** comparing these two types of pills. Here's what that study showed:

- **Preventing pregnancy:** Both types worked equally well
- **Bleeding patterns:** Women on monophasic pills had more regular bleeding. Women on quadriphasic pills had fewer bleeding days overall
- **Side effects:** Both caused similar problems, except more women on quadriphasic pills reported breast pain
- **Stopping the pill:** Similar numbers of women stopped using each type

## Bottom line

There isn't enough research yet to say if quadriphasic pills are truly better than monophasic pills. More studies are needed. For now, doctors recommend starting with standard monophasic pills.","### Plain Language Summary

This study looked at two types of birth control pills: quadriphasic and monophasic pills. The goal was to see how well they work and how they affect bleeding, side effects, and overall satisfaction.

#### What Was Studied?

Researchers wanted to know:

- How effective are these pills at preventing pregnancy?
- Do they cause different patterns of bleeding?
- What side effects do they have?
- Do people find them easy to use?

#### Who Was Involved?

The study included one main trial where researchers compared a quadriphasic pill with a monophasic pill.

#### Key Findings

- Both types of pills were about the same in preventing pregnancy and causing people to stop using them because of side effects.
- Women using monophasic pills had more regular monthly bleeding.
- Women using quadriphasic pills reported less bleeding and spotting days.
- More women on quadriphasic pills experienced breast pain.

#### Conclusions

There isn’t enough evidence to say whether one type of pill is better. More studies are needed, especially with pills of similar ingredients. For now, monophasic pills with 30 μg of estrogen are recommended for new users."
"Background
Women who want to start intrauterine contraception (IUC) during the postpartum period might benefit from IUC insertion immediately after delivery. Postplacental insertion greatly reduces the risk of subsequent pregnancy and eliminates the need for a return visit to start contraception. Without the option of immediate insertion, many women may never return for services or may adopt less effective contraception. 
Objectives
Our aim was to examine the outcomes of IUC insertion immediately after placenta delivery (within 10 minutes), especially when compared with insertion at other postpartum times. We focused on successful IUC placement (insertion), subsequent expulsion, and method use. 
Search methods
We searched for trials until 1 April 2015. Sources included PubMed (MEDLINE), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), POPLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP. For the original review, the authors contacted investigators to identify other trials. 
Selection criteria
We sought randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with at least one treatment arm that involved immediate IUC placement (i.e., within 10 minutes of placenta delivery). Comparison arms could have included early postpartum insertion (from 10 minutes postplacental to hospital discharge) or standard insertion (during a postpartum visit). Trials could also have compared different IUC methods or insertion techniques. Delivery may have been vaginal or cesarean. Primary outcomes were placement (insertion), subsequent expulsion, and method use at study assessment. 
Data collection and analysis
For dichotomous outcomes, we used the Mantel‐Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Earlier studies primarily reported results as life‐table rates. We aggregated trials in a meta‐analysis if they had similar interventions and outcome measures. A sensitivity analysis included studies with moderate or high quality evidence and sufficient outcome data. 
Main results
We included 15 trials. Seven studies reported from 2010 to 2014 were added to eight from the original 2001 review. Newer trials compared immediate postplacental insertion versus early (10 minutes to 48 hours) or standard insertion (during the postpartum visit). Of four with full reports, three were small trials. The other three studies had conference abstracts. The eight early trials examined immediate insertion of different devices or insertion techniques. Most studies were published in the 1980s, some with limited reporting. 
Our sensitivity analysis included trials with sufficient outcome data and moderate or high quality evidence. Four newer trials comparing insertion times met the inclusion criteria. Two studies used the levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG‐IUS) after vaginal delivery. The other two trials placed IUC after cesarean section; one used the CuT 380A intrauterine device (IUD) and the other used the LNG‐IUS. 
A pilot trial compared immediate insertion versus early or standard insertion. In groups comparing immediate versus early insertion (N = 30), all women had the LNG‐IUS inserted. By six months, the groups had the same expulsion rate and did not differ significantly in IUC use. 
For immediate versus standard insertion, we conducted meta‐analyses of four trials. Insertion rates did not differ significantly between study arms. However, the trial from Uganda showed insertion was more likely for the immediate group, although the estimate was imprecise. In the meta‐analysis, expulsion by six months was more likely for the immediate group, but the confidence interval was wide (OR 4.89, 95% CI 1.47 to 16.32; participants = 210; studies = 4). IUC use at six months was more likely with immediate insertion than with standard insertion (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.01 to 4.09; participants = 243; studies = 4). Study arms did not differ in use at 3 or 12 months in individual small trials. 
Authors' conclusions
Recent trials compared different insertion times after vaginal or cesarean delivery. Evidence was limited because studies with full reports generally had small sample sizes. Overall, the quality of evidence was moderate; abstracts and older studies had limited reporting. Ongoing trials will add to the evidence, although some are small. Trials of adequate power are needed to estimate expulsion rates and side effects. 
The benefit of effective contraception immediately after delivery may outweigh the disadvantage of increased risk for expulsion. Frequent prenatal visits during the third trimester provide the opportunity to discuss effective contraceptive methods and desired timing for initiation. Clinical follow‐up can help detect early expulsion, as can educating women about expulsion signs and symptoms.","Intrauterine contraception soon after childbirth
Women have two main choices for intrauterine contraception (IUC): one that releases the hormone levonorgestrel, and one without hormones that contains copper. Beginning IUC use right after childbirth and before hospital discharge can be good for many reasons. The woman knows she is not pregnant, and the time and place are convenient for starting a method that works well. We looked at whether IUC would be more likely to come out on its own if put in right after birth of a baby. For women who wanted IUC but did not have it placed right away, we studied whether they returned later for insertion. 
Until 1 April 2015, we ran computer searches for randomized trials of IUC inserted within 10 minutes of placenta (afterbirth) delivery. We wrote to researchers to find more studies. Trials could compare different times for insertion as well as types of IUC and ways to insert the device. 
We found 15 trials. Seven recent studies compared IUC insertion right after childbirth versus early insertion (before hospital discharge) or later insertion (weeks after discharge). Four had full reports, although three were small studies. Insertion was as likely to occur when placed right after childbirth as when planned for later placement, except in a study from Uganda. For the four trials overall, the IUC came out more often on its own when placed right after childbirth than when inserted weeks later. Use at six months was more likely with insertion right after childbirth than weeks later. In single studies, the groups did not differ in use at 3 months or 12 months. 
Eight older studies looked at types of IUC put in right after childbirth. Changing IUC design did not seem to affect whether IUC stayed in or whether it was used later on. Inserting IUC by hand or with a holding instrument did not seem to make a difference. 
We found newer trials with full reports that compared placement times. The studies were of good quality. Ongoing trials will provide additional data, although some sample sizes are small. Larger studies would provide better information on whether the IUC came out on its own and on whether side effects occurred.","# Plain Language Summary: Intrauterine Contraception After Delivery

## What is this study about?

This review looked at studies comparing different times to insert an intrauterine contraceptive (IUC)—a small device placed in the uterus to prevent pregnancy. The main question was: Is it better to insert an IUC right after a baby is born, or should women wait and have it inserted at a later doctor's visit?

## Why does this matter?

Many women want to use an IUC for birth control after having a baby. If doctors can insert it immediately after delivery, women don't have to make another trip to the clinic. This might help more women actually use this type of contraception, since some women never return for a follow-up visit.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for studies published through April 2015 that compared:
- **Immediate insertion**: IUC placed within 10 minutes after the placenta comes out
- **Early insertion**: IUC placed between 10 minutes and 48 hours after delivery
- **Standard insertion**: IUC placed during a regular doctor's visit weeks later

They looked at 15 studies total to see what happened with each approach.

## What did they find?

**The good news:**
- Women who had immediate insertion were more likely to still be using the IUC at 6 months compared to those who waited for a regular clinic visit.

**The concern:**
- IUCs inserted immediately after delivery were more likely to fall out (be expelled) by 6 months.

**The bottom line:**
- Getting effective birth control right away may be worth the slightly higher risk of it falling out, especially since doctors can check for this and teach women what to watch for.

## What's next?

More research is needed with larger groups of women to better understand the risks and benefits of immediate insertion.","**Study Summary: Inserting Intrauterine Contraception After Delivery**

**Background:** 
This study looked at women who want to use an intrauterine device (IUD) right after giving birth. Inserting the IUD immediately can lower the chance of getting pregnant again soon and removes the need for another visit to start contraception.

**Objective:**
The goal was to find out what happens when an IUD is placed right after the placenta is delivered (within 10 minutes), compared to other times after birth. The study focused on how well the IUD stays in place, if it comes out, and if women keep using it.

**Methods:**
Researchers looked at studies up to April 2015 from various databases. They wanted trials where women got an IUD right after delivery. They compared this with IUDs inserted later in the hospital or at a postpartum visit. 

**Results:**
- 15 trials were reviewed, comparing different times and methods of IUD insertion.
- Newer studies from 2010 to 2014 were added to older ones.
- Some studies looked at vaginal births; others at cesarean sections.
- In a meta-analysis of four trials, immediate insertion didn’t have much difference in success rates but had a higher chance of coming out within six months. However, more women continued using the IUD if it was placed immediately.

**Conclusions:**
Finding the best time for IUD insertion after birth requires more research, especially on how often IUDs come out and any side effects. Immediate IUD insertion might be helpful despite a slightly higher risk of it coming out. Discussions during pregnancy about birth control can help women decide what's best for them. Regular check-ups can catch any issues early."
"Background
Diverticulitis is a complication of the common condition, diverticulosis. Uncomplicated diverticulitis has traditionally been treated with antibiotics, as diverticulitis has been regarded as an infectious disease. Risk factors for diverticulitis, however, may suggest that the condition is inflammatory rather than infectious which makes the use of antibiotics questionable. 
Objectives
The objectives of this systematic review were to determine if antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis affects the risk of complications (immediate or late) or the need for emergency surgery. 
Search methods
For this update, a comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted in Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform on February 2021. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including all types of patients with a radiologically confirmed diagnosis of left‐sided uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Comparator and interventions included antibiotics compared to no antibiotics, placebo, or to any other antibiotic treatment (different regimens, routes of administration, dosage or duration of treatment). Primary outcome measures were complications and emergency surgery. Secondary outcomes were recurrence, late complications, elective colonic resections, length of hospital stay, length to recovery of symptoms, adverse events and mortality. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors performed the searches, identification and assessment of RCTs and data extraction. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or involvement of the third author. Authors of trials were contacted to obtain additional data if needed or for preliminary results of ongoing trials. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias was used to assess the methodological quality of the identified trials. The overall quality of evidence for outcomes was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Effect estimates were extracted as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals. Random‐effects meta‐analyses were performed with the Mantel‐Haenzel method. 
Main results
The authors included five studies. Three studies compared no antibiotics to antibiotics; all three were original RCTs of which two also published long‐term follow‐up information.  For the outcome of short‐term complications there may be little or no difference between antibiotics and no antibiotics (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.30 to 2.62; 3 studies, 1329 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The rate of emergency surgery within 30 days may be lower with no antibiotics compared to antibiotics (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.13, 1.71; 1329 participants; 3 studies; low‐certainty evidence). However, there is considerable imprecision due to wide confidence intervals for this effect estimate causing uncertainty which means that there may also be a benefit with antibiotics. 
One of the two remaining trials compared single to double compound antibiotic therapy and, due to wide confidence intervals, the estimate was imprecise and indicated an uncertain clinical effect between these two antibiotic regimens (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.11 to 4.58; 51 participants; 1 study; low‐certainty evidence). The last trial compared short to long intravenous administration of antibiotics and did not report any events for our primary outcomes. Both trials included few participants and one had overall high risk of bias. 
Since the first publication of this systematic review, an increasing amount of evidence supporting the treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis without antibiotics has been published, but the total body of evidence is still limited. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence on antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated acute diverticulitis suggests that the effect of antibiotics is uncertain for complications, emergency surgery, recurrence, elective colonic resections, and long‐term complications. The quality of the evidence is low. Only three RCTs on the need for antibiotics are currently available. More trials are needed to obtain more precise effect estimates.","Antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis
Diverticulitis is a condition with inflammation of the so‐called diverticulae. A diverticulae is a weakness in the bowel wall. Diverticulae are common in the population, especially in the elderly above the age of 60 years, and are often asymptomatic. Diverticulitis may present as abdominal pain and tenderness accompanied by signs of infection, such as fever. In most cases, diverticulitis resolves without complications, however, some patients develop complications and may need emergency surgery. 
Uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is the focus of this review. It has traditionally been regarded as an infection with bacterial overgrowth in the large intestine and has been treated with antibiotics. Recently, it has been argued that diverticulitis is more likely to be an inflammatory rather than an infectious condition, making the use of antibiotics questionable. Consequently, a shift towards the use of therapeutic regimens without antibiotics has been seen. This present review investigates whether there is any existing clinical evidence supporting the use of antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis. 
Five clinical trials in hospitalised patients were assessed. One trial investigated two different antibiotic treatments and a second study investigated the duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment. Three trials investigated the actual need for antibiotics when compared to no antibiotics of which two trials had published long‐term follow‐up results as separate records. None of the studies found a statistical difference in the tested antibiotic regimens. Comparing no antibiotic versus antibiotic treatment did not demonstrate any differences in the occurrence of complications like abscesses and perforations of the large intestine, or in the need for emergency surgery. 
Antibiotics can cause serious adverse effects, including life‐threatening allergic reactions or super‐infections of the intestine. Growing antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem rendering some infections impossible to treat with possible fatal outcomes. Therefore, strong arguments in favour of limiting the current use of antibiotics exist. Only three randomised controlled trials on the need of antibiotics are currently available and more are needed in order to obtain strong and reliable evidence. However, the newest evidence shows that the use of antibiotics for the treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is not superior to treatments that do not include antibiotics.","# Plain Language Summary: Do Antibiotics Help Treat Uncomplicated Diverticulitis?

## What is this study about?

This study looked at whether antibiotics are necessary to treat a condition called uncomplicated diverticulitis. Doctors have traditionally given antibiotics for this condition, but researchers wanted to know if antibiotics actually make a difference.

## What is diverticulitis?

Diverticulitis happens when small pouches in the large intestine become inflamed (swollen and irritated). When it's ""uncomplicated,"" it means there are no serious problems like tears or infections spreading into the belly.

## What did researchers want to find out?

The researchers wanted to know:
- Does taking antibiotics prevent serious problems from happening?
- Does taking antibiotics prevent the need for emergency surgery?
- Does taking antibiotics help people recover faster?

## How did they do this?

Researchers searched for studies that compared patients who received antibiotics to patients who did not receive antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis. They found 5 studies to review.

## What did they find?

The results were unclear:
- **Serious problems**: There may be little or no difference between patients who took antibiotics and those who didn't.
- **Emergency surgery**: Patients who didn't take antibiotics might have needed emergency surgery less often, but the results weren't certain.
- **Other comparisons**: Two other studies compared different types of antibiotics, but they had too few patients to give clear answers.

## Bottom line

The evidence doesn't clearly show that antibiotics help or hurt. The researchers say **more studies are needed** to know for sure whether antibiotics are necessary for treating uncomplicated diverticulitis.","### Plain Language Summary

**What is this study about?**
This study looks at whether antibiotics are helpful for treating uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, which is a condition affecting the intestines. Doctors usually use antibiotics for it, but there's a question about whether they are really necessary.

**What did the researchers want to find out?**
The researchers wanted to know if using antibiotics lowers the risk of having problems or needing emergency surgery when someone has uncomplicated diverticulitis.

**How did they do the study?**
They searched many medical databases to find studies that compared people with diverticulitis who got antibiotics and those who did not. They looked at different outcomes like complications, surgery, recurrence, and recovery time.

**What did they find?**
- They included five studies with over a thousand participants.
- Three studies showed there might be little to no difference between those who took antibiotics and those who didn’t for short-term complications.
- Fewer people needed emergency surgery if they didn’t take antibiotics, but this result wasn’t very certain.
- Some studies involved comparing different types of antibiotic treatments, but these studies had small groups and weren’t very clear.

**What does this mean?**
The evidence suggests that it’s unclear if antibiotics are really needed for uncomplicated diverticulitis. The current research is not strong enough to make a definite conclusion, and more studies are needed to understand better.

**Important Note:**
The information from this study is not strong enough yet to change how diverticulitis is treated. More research is needed to be sure of the best way to treat this condition."
"Background
Amphetamine dependence is a public health problem with medical, psychiatric, cognitive, legal and socioeconomic consequences. To date, no pharmacological treatment has been approved for this disorder, and psychotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment. In recent years, psychostimulants have been investigated as a possible replacement therapy. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of psychostimulant medications for amphetamine abuse or dependence. The influences of type of drug, type of dependence, comorbid disorders, clinical trial risk of bias and publication of data were also studied. 
Search methods
Relevant trials were searched in the following sources: PubMed (January 1966 to 6 June 2012), EMBASE (January 1988 to 6 June 2012), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, Issue 5 of 12, May 2012), PsycINFO (January 1985 to 6 June 2012) and the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Group (June 2012). We also searched the reference lists of retrieved trials, the list of studies citing the included trials and the main electronic registers of ongoing trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and EU Clinical Trials Register). Finally, we contacted investigators to request information about unpublished trials. Searches included non－English language literature. 
Selection criteria
All randomised, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group clinical trials investigating the efficacy or safety of psychostimulants for amphetamine dependence or abuse conducted in an outpatient setting. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
Main results
Eleven studies were included in the review (791 participants). Studied psychostimulants included dexamphetamine, bupropion, methylphenidate and modafinil. No significant differences were found between psychostimulants and placebo for any of the studied efficacy outcomes. Overall retention in studies was low (50.4%). Psychostimulants did not reduce amphetamine use (mean difference (MD) ‐0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.85 to 0.33) or amphetamine craving (MD 0.07, 95% CI ‐0.44 to 0.59) and did not increase sustained abstinence (relative risk (RR) 1.12, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.49). The proportion of adverse events inducing dropout was similar for psychostimulants and placebo (risk difference (RD) 0.01, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.04). The main findings did not change in any subgroup analysis. 
Authors' conclusions
Results of this review do not support the use of psychostimulant medications at the tested doses as a replacement therapy for amphetamine abuse or dependence. Future research could change this conclusion, as the numbers of included studies and participants are limited and information on relevant outcomes, such as efficacy according to the severity of dependence or craving, is still missing.","Efficacy of psychostimulant drugs for amphetamine abuse or dependence
Amphetamine dependence constitutes a public health problem with many consequences and complications. Amphetamine abuse refers to a maladaptive and hazardous pattern of use considered to be less severe than dependence. To date, no pharmacological treatment has been approved for amphetamine abuse or dependence, and psychotherapy remains the best treatment option. 
Long‐term amphetamine use reduces dopamine levels in the brain. Drugs increasing dopamine and mimicking the effects of amphetamines with lower abuse liability could be used as replacement therapy in amphetamine dependence. Several psychostimulants have been studied recently for this purpose. 
In this review, the efficacy and safety of psychostimulants for amphetamine abuse or dependence were studied. We found eleven studies enrolling 791 amphetamine‐dependent participants and assessing the effects of four different psychostimulants: dexamphetamine, bupropion, methylphenidate and modafinil. Psychosocial interventions were additionally provided to all participants. The studies were conducted in the USA, Australia or Northern Europe, and study length ranged from 8 to 20 weeks. 
Psychostimulants did not reduce amphetamine use or amphetamine craving and also did not increase sustained abstinence in comparison with placebo. Retention in treatment was similar and low with both treatments. Psychostimulants also did not increase the risk of adverse events that were intense enough to induce dropouts. 
Research with larger and longer trials is needed to determine whether psychostimulants can be a useful replacement therapy for patients with amphetamine abuse or dependence. The design of future trials should consider the level of dependence at study entry, the potency and the dose of the psychostimulant administered, the length of the trial and the representativeness of included participants.","# Plain Language Summary

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether certain medications called psychostimulants could help people who struggle with amphetamine use. Researchers searched for and studied 11 different clinical trials involving 791 people total.

## Why does this matter?

Right now, there is no approved medication to treat amphetamine dependence. Doctors mainly use talk therapy and counseling. Scientists wanted to know if psychostimulant medications—which are stimulant drugs—might help people reduce their amphetamine use, similar to how some medications help with other addictions.

## What medications were tested?

The studies looked at four different psychostimulant medications:
- Dexamphetamine
- Bupropion
- Methylphenidate
- Modafinil

## What did researchers find?

**The main result:** The psychostimulant medications did not work better than placebo (fake pills) for helping people with amphetamine dependence.

Specifically:
- The medications did not reduce how much amphetamine people used
- The medications did not reduce cravings for amphetamine
- The medications did not help people stay off amphetamine
- Side effects were similar between the medication and placebo groups

## What else is important to know?

- Only about half the people in the studies stayed in the program until the end
- The researchers say more studies are needed before drawing final conclusions","### Plain Language Summary

**Background**
Using amphetamines, a type of drug, can cause big problems in health, mind, and life. Right now, there’s no approved medicine to help people stop using these drugs. Talking therapies are mostly used for this. Scientists are checking if using similar drugs might help people stop.

**What was the study about?**
The study checked if certain medicines called psychostimulants can help people stop using amphetamines safely. Researchers also looked at different types of these drugs and how other health issues might affect results.

**How did they find information?**
Researchers looked for studies from several scientific websites and databases. They also checked lists of other studies and contacted scientists to find more information, even in other languages.

**What did they study?**
They focused on studies where people taking new drugs were compared to those taking a fake pill (placebo) to check if these new drugs are safe and helpful.

**Key Findings**
- They included 11 studies with 791 people.
- The drugs studied were dexamphetamine, bupropion, methylphenidate, and modafinil.
- These drugs didn’t work better than a fake pill in stopping amphetamine use or cravings.
- Many people left the studies early.
- The side effects were similar whether people took the new drugs or the fake ones.

**Conclusion**
The study found that these drugs didn’t help people stop using amphetamines at the tested doses. More research might change these results, because there weren’t many studies and important information is still missing."
"Background
Approximately 3.7 million people died from acute coronary syndrome worldwide in 2012. Acute coronary syndrome, also known as myocardial infarction or unstable angina pectoris, is caused by a sudden blockage of the blood supplied to the heart muscle. Percutaneous coronary intervention is often used for acute coronary syndrome, but previous systematic reviews on the effects of drug‐eluting stents compared with bare‐metal stents have shown conflicting results with regard to myocardial infarction; have not fully taken account of the risk of random and systematic errors; and have not included all relevant randomised clinical trials. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of drug‐eluting stents versus bare‐metal stents in people with acute coronary syndrome. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, SCI‐EXPANDED, and BIOSIS from their inception to January 2017. We also searched two clinical trials registers, the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration databases, and pharmaceutical company websites. In addition, we searched the reference lists of review articles and relevant trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised clinical trials assessing the effects of drug‐eluting stents versus bare‐metal stents for acute coronary syndrome. We included trials irrespective of publication type, status, date, or language. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed our published protocol and the methodological recommendations of Cochrane. Two review authors independently extracted data. We assessed the risks of systematic error by bias domains. We conducted Trial Sequential Analyses to control the risks of random errors. Our primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, serious adverse events, and quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were angina, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction. Our primary assessment time point was at maximum follow‐up. We assessed the quality of the evidence by the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 25 trials randomising a total of 12,503 participants. All trials were at high risk of bias, and the quality of evidence according to GRADE was low to very low. We included 22 trials where the participants presented with ST‐elevation myocardial infarction, 1 trial where participants presented with non‐ST‐elevation myocardial infarction, and 2 trials where participants presented with a mix of acute coronary syndromes. 
Meta‐analyses at maximum follow‐up showed no evidence of a difference when comparing drug‐eluting stents with bare‐metal stents on the risk of all‐cause mortality or major cardiovascular events. The absolute risk of death was 6.97% in the drug‐eluting stents group compared with 7.74% in the bare‐metal stents group based on the risk ratio (RR) of 0.90 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.03, 11,250 participants, 21 trials/22 comparisons, low‐quality evidence). The absolute risk of a major cardiovascular event was 6.36% in the drug‐eluting stents group compared with 6.63% in the bare‐metal stents group based on the RR of 0.96 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.11, 10,939 participants, 19 trials/20 comparisons, very low‐quality evidence). The results of Trial Sequential Analysis showed that we did not have sufficient information to confirm or reject our anticipated risk ratio reduction of 10% on either all‐cause mortality or major cardiovascular events at maximum follow‐up. 
Meta‐analyses at maximum follow‐up showed evidence of a benefit when comparing drug‐eluting stents with bare‐metal stents on the risk of a serious adverse event. The absolute risk of a serious adverse event was 18.04% in the drug‐eluting stents group compared with 23.01% in the bare‐metal stents group based on the RR of 0.80 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.86, 11,724 participants, 22 trials/23 comparisons, low‐quality evidence), and Trial Sequential Analysis confirmed this result. When assessing each specific type of adverse event included in the serious adverse event outcome separately, the majority of the events were target vessel revascularisation. When target vessel revascularisation was analysed separately, meta‐analysis showed evidence of a benefit of drug‐eluting stents, and Trial Sequential Analysis confirmed this result. 
Meta‐analyses at maximum follow‐up showed no evidence of a difference when comparing drug‐eluting stents with bare‐metal stents on the risk of cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.09, 9248 participants, 14 trials/15 comparisons, very low‐quality evidence) or myocardial infarction (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.18, 10,217 participants, 18 trials/19 comparisons, very low‐quality evidence). The results of the Trial Sequential Analysis showed that we had insufficient information to confirm or reject our anticipated risk ratio reduction of 10% on cardiovascular mortality and myocardial infarction. 
No trials reported results on quality of life or angina.
Authors' conclusions
The current evidence suggests that drug‐eluting stents may lead to fewer serious adverse events compared with bare‐metal stents without increasing the risk of all‐cause mortality or major cardiovascular events. However, our Trial Sequential Analysis showed that there currently was not enough information to assess a risk ratio reduction of 10% for all‐cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, or myocardial infarction, and there were no data on quality of life or angina. The evidence in this review was of low to very low quality, and the true result may depart substantially from the results presented in this review. 
More randomised clinical trials with low risk of bias and low risks of random errors are needed if the benefits and harms of drug‐eluting stents for acute coronary syndrome are to be assessed properly. More data are needed on the outcomes all‐cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, quality of life, and angina to reduce the risk of random error.","Benefits and harms of drug‐eluting versus bare‐metal stents in people with acute coronary syndrome 
Background 
Acute coronary syndrome is a term applied to heart attacks as well as chest pain during rest. The syndrome is caused by decreased blood supply to the heart due to either a narrowing of the vessels supplying the heart or a blood clot. According to the World Health Organization, 3.7 million people died from acute coronary syndrome in 2012. Percutaneous coronary intervention, commonly known as coronary angioplasty, is used to treat the narrowed or blocked vessel of the heart by inflating a balloon to allow blood to flow through the vessel again. Coronary stents are then inserted into the vessel to ensure it remains open. Two types of stents are available for use, a stent that is coated with a drug intended to reduce the risk of future blockages (drug‐eluting stent) and an uncoated stent (bare‐metal stent). In this review, we aimed to assess the benefits and harms of drug‐eluting stents compared with bare‐metal stents. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases from their inception to January 2017 and found 25 trials where people were randomly allocated to either a group receiving drug‐eluting stents or a group receiving bare‐metal stents. The 25 trials (26 comparisons) included 12,503 adults with a mean age of 60.8 years. 
Key results 
The people receiving drug‐eluting stents did seem to have a reduced risk of experiencing a serious adverse event compared with those receiving bare‐metal stents, without affecting the risk of dying from any cause or specifically heart disease, or of having a heart attack. The serious adverse event likely to be avoided by those receiving drug‐eluting stents seems to be repeat balloon angioplasty. No data were reported on quality of life or chest pain (angina) after receiving the stent. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence should be interpreted with caution, as we judged the quality to be low to very low due to limitations of the included randomised clinical trials. The reason for the very low‐quality judgement was mainly due to all included trials being at high risk of bias. Consequently, the results may show more benefit of drug‐eluting stents than the 'real life' effect would show. Furthermore, most of the outcomes in our review lacked sufficient statistical power. Future well‐designed randomised clinical trials may therefore change the above‐mentioned results.","# Plain Language Summary: Drug-Eluting Stents vs. Bare-Metal Stents for Heart Blockages

## What is this study about?

This study compared two types of stents (tiny tubes that hold arteries open) used to treat sudden heart blockages. Researchers wanted to know which type works better and is safer.

## Why does this matter?

Every year, millions of people worldwide have sudden blockages in the blood vessels that supply their heart. Doctors use stents to open these blocked vessels. There are two main types: drug-eluting stents (which release medicine) and bare-metal stents (which don't). Previous studies gave mixed results about which is better.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at 25 studies that tested these two types of stents in 12,503 people. They searched medical databases through January 2017 and compared results from all the studies together.

## What did they find?

**Death rates:** Both stent types had similar death rates. About 7 out of 100 people died with drug-eluting stents compared to about 8 out of 100 with bare-metal stents.

**Major heart problems:** Both stent types had similar rates of major heart problems (about 6 out of 100 people in each group).

**Serious side effects:** Drug-eluting stents had fewer serious side effects (18 out of 100 people) compared to bare-metal stents (23 out of 100 people). Most of these side effects involved needing another procedure to open the vessel again.

**Other outcomes:** Studies didn't report enough information about quality of life or chest pain.

## What does this mean?

Drug-eluting stents may cause fewer serious side effects without increasing death risk. However, the evidence quality was low, meaning we can't be completely certain about these results. More research is needed to give doctors and patients better information.","**Plain Language Summary: Comparing Drug‐Eluting Stents and Bare‐Metal Stents for Heart Problems**

**Purpose of the Study:**
This study looks at two types of stents—drug‐eluting stents and bare‐metal stents—to see which is better for people with a heart condition called acute coronary syndrome. This problem happens when the blood supply to the heart gets blocked.

**Who Participated:**
Scientists studied 25 different trials with a total of 12,503 people who had heart issues.

**What They Found:**
- **Death Rates and Major Heart Problems:** There wasn't a big difference in death rates or major heart problems between those who got drug‐eluting stents and those who got bare‐metal stents.
- **Serious Side Effects:** People with drug‐eluting stents had fewer serious side effects overall, especially needing fewer repeat procedures on the same blood vessel.
- **Unclear Areas:** The study didn't find enough strong evidence to clearly say if these stents make a big difference in preventing deaths or major heart problems. They also didn't have information on how these stents affect people’s daily lives or if they help with chest pain (angina).

**Safety and Quality:**
The evidence was not very strong because there might be errors or biases. More high-quality research is needed to know for sure about the benefits and risks of drug‐eluting stents.

**Conclusion:**
Drug‐eluting stents might help avoid some side effects compared to bare‐metal stents, but more research is needed to learn more about their overall benefits and safety for people with heart problems."
"Background
Social skills programmes (SSP) are treatment strategies aimed at enhancing the social performance and reducing the distress and difficulty experienced by people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and can be incorporated as part of the rehabilitation package for people with schizophrenia. 
Objectives
The primary objective is to investigate the effects of social skills training programmes, compared to standard care, for people with schizophrenia. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (November 2006 and December 2011) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We inspected references of all identified studies for further trials. 
A further search for studies has been conducted by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group in 2015, 37 citations have been found and are currently being assessed by review authors. 
Selection criteria
We included all relevant randomised controlled trials for social skills programmes versus standard care involving people with serious mental illnesses. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and 95% CIs. 
Main results
We included 13 randomised trials (975 participants). These evaluated social skills programmes versus standard care, or discussion group. We found evidence in favour of social skills programmes compared to standard care on all measures of social functioning. We also found that rates of relapse and rehospitalisation were lower for social skills compared to standard care (relapse: 2 RCTs, n = 263, RR 0.52 CI 0.34 to 0.79, very low quality evidence), (rehospitalisation: 1 RCT, n = 143, RR 0.53 CI 0.30 to 0.93, very low quality evidence) and participants’ mental state results (1 RCT, n = 91, MD ‐4.01 CI ‐7.52 to ‐0.50, very low quality evidence) were better in the group receiving social skill programmes. Global state was measured in one trial by numbers not experiencing a clinical improvement, results favoured social skills (1 RCT, n = 67, RR 0.29 CI 0.12 to 0.68, very low quality evidence). Quality of life was also improved in the social skills programme compared to standard care (1 RCT, n = 112, MD ‐7.60 CI ‐12.18 to ‐3.02, very low quality evidence). However, when social skills programmes were compared to a discussion group control, we found no significant differences in the participants social functioning, relapse rates, mental state or quality of life, again the quality of evidence for these outcomes was very low. 
Authors' conclusions
Compared to standard care, social skills training may improve the social skills of people with schizophrenia and reduce relapse rates, but at present, the evidence is very limited with data rated as very low quality. When social skills training was compared to discussion there was no difference on patients outcomes. Cultural differences might limit the applicability of the current results, as most reported studies were conducted in China. Whether social skills training can improve social functioning of people with schizophrenia in different settings remains unclear and should be investigated in a large multi‐centre randomised controlled trial.","Social skills programmes for people with schizophrenia
Social skills programmes (SSP) use behavioural therapy and techniques for teaching individuals to communicate their emotions and requests. This means they are more likely to achieve their goals, meet their needs for relationships and for independent living as well as getting on with other people and socially adjusting. Social skills programmes involve 'model learning' (role playing) which was introduced to improve general 'molecular' skills (eye contact, fluency of speech, gestures) and 'molar' skills (managing negative emotions, giving positive feedback). Social skills programmes enhance social performance and reduce the distress and difficulty experienced by people with schizophrenia. Social skills programmes can be incorporated as part of a rehabilitation package for people with schizophrenia. 
The main objective of this review is to investigate the effectiveness of social skills programmes, compared to standard care or discussion groups, for people with schizophrenia. Based on searches carried out in 2006 and 2011, this review includes 13 trials with a total of 975 participants. Authors chose seven main outcomes of interest, all data for these outcomes were rated to be very low quality. The review found significant differences in favour of social skills programmes compared to standard care on all measures of social functioning. Rates of relapse were lower for social skills compared to standard care and there was a significant difference in favour of social skills on people’s mental state. Quality of life was also improved in the social skills programme compared to standard care. However, when social skills programmes were compared to discussion groups, there were no significant differences in people’s social functioning, relapse rates, mental state or quality of life. 
Compared to standard care, social skills programmes may improve the social skills of people with schizophrenia and reduce relapse rates. However, at the moment evidence is very limited with data only of very low quality available. Cultural differences might also limit the relevance of current results, as most reported studies were conducted in China. Whether social skills programmes or training can improve the social functioning of people with schizophrenia in different settings remains unclear and should be further investigated in a large multi‐centre randomised controlled trial. 
Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation.http://mcpin.org/","# Plain Language Summary: Social Skills Training for People with Schizophrenia

## What is this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if social skills training programs help people with schizophrenia. Social skills training teaches people how to interact better with others and handle everyday social situations.

## Who was studied?

The review looked at 13 different research studies involving 975 people with schizophrenia. All of these studies compared social skills training to regular care or discussion groups.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched medical databases for all studies that tested social skills training programs. They compared results between people who received social skills training and people who received standard care or attended discussion groups instead.

## What did they find?

**When compared to standard care:**
- People who got social skills training did better at social activities
- Fewer people had a return of symptoms (relapse)
- Fewer people had to go back to the hospital
- People felt better overall and had better quality of life

**When compared to discussion groups:**
- There was no clear difference between social skills training and discussion groups

## Important note

The researchers said the evidence is still limited and not very strong. Most studies were done in China, so results might be different in other places. More research is needed to know for sure if social skills training works well everywhere.","### Social Skills Programs for Improving Social Abilities

**What was the study about?**
This study looked at whether social skills programs can help people improve their social abilities when compared to regular care.

**Who was involved in the study?**
The study included 975 participants who received either social skills training or standard care. It was focused on people who face challenges in social settings.

**What did the researchers do?**
Researchers compared the effects of social skills programs to regular care. They used previously recorded trials and took a close look at the data.

**What were the key results?**
- Social skills programs helped improve social interactions.
- People in the program had fewer relapses and were less likely to need hospital stays compared to those who got standard care.
- Quality of life seemed better for those in the social skills program.
- When compared to a discussion group, however, there wasn’t a noticeable difference in outcomes.

**How reliable are these results?**
The results are based on very limited evidence, mostly from studies in China. This means we can’t be sure if the same results would happen in different places or with larger groups.

**What’s next?**
More research in different countries and with more people is needed to understand how well social skills programs work.

**Is it safe?**
The study focused on comparing experiences and outcomes safely for participants."
"Background
Primary malaria prevention on a large scale depends on two vector control interventions: indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide‐treated mosquito nets (ITNs). Historically, IRS has reduced malaria transmission in many settings in the world, but the health effects of IRS have never been properly quantified. This is important, and will help compare IRS with other vector control interventions. 
Objectives
To quantify the impact of IRS alone, and to compare the relative impacts of IRS and ITNs, on key malariological parameters. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (September 2009), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2009), EMBASE (1974 to September 2009), LILACS (1982 to September 2009), mRCT (September 2009), reference lists, and conference abstracts. We also contacted researchers in the field, organizations, and manufacturers of insecticides (June 2007). 
Selection criteria
Cluster randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before‐and‐after studies (CBA) and interrupted time series (ITS) of IRS compared to no IRS or ITNs. Studies examining the impact of IRS on special groups not representative of the general population, or using insecticides and dosages not recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) were excluded. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently reviewed trials for inclusion. Two authors extracted data, assessed risk of bias and analysed the data. Where possible, we adjusted confidence intervals (CIs) for clustering. Studies were grouped into those comparing IRS with no IRS, and IRS compared with ITNs, and then stratified by malaria endemicity. 
Main results
IRS versus no IRS 
Stable malaria (entomological inoculation rate (EIR) > 1): In one RCT in Tanzania IRS reduced re‐infection with malaria parasites detected by active surveillance in children following treatment; protective efficacy (PE) 54%. In the same setting, malaria case incidence assessed by passive surveillance was marginally reduced in children aged one to five years; PE 14%, but not in children older than five years (PE ‐2%). In the IRS group, malaria prevalence was slightly lower but this was not significant (PE 6%), but mean haemoglobin was higher (mean difference 0.85 g/dL). 
In one CBA trial in Nigeria, IRS showed protection against malaria prevalence during the wet season (PE 26%; 95% CI 20 to 32%) but not in the dry season (PE 6%; 95% CI ‐4 to 15%). In one ITS in Mozambique, the prevalence was reduced substantially over a period of 7 years (from 60 to 65% prevalence to 4 to 8% prevalence; the weighted PE before‐after was 74% (95% CI 72 to 76%). 
Unstable malaria (EIR < 1): In two RCTs, IRS reduced the incidence rate of all malaria infections;PE 31% in India, and 88% (95% CI 69 to 96%) in Pakistan. By malaria species, IRS also reduced the incidence of P. falciparum (PE 93%, 95% CI 61 to 98% in Pakistan) and P. vivax (PE 79%, 95% CI 45 to 90% in Pakistan); There were similar impacts on malaria prevalence for any infection: PE 76% in Pakistan; PE 28% in India. When looking separately by parasite species, for P. falciparum there was a PE of 92% in Pakistan and 34% in India; forP. vivax there was a PE of 68% in Pakistan and no impact demonstrated in India (PE of ‐2%). 
IRS versus Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) 
Stable malaria (EIR > 1): Only one RCT was done in an area of stable transmission (in Tanzania). When comparing parasitological re‐infection by active surveillance after treatment in short‐term cohorts, ITNs appeared better, but it was likely not to be significant as the unadjusted CIs approached 1 (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.22). When the incidence of malaria episodes was measured by passive case detection, no difference was found in children aged one to five years (risk ratio = 0.88, direction in favour of IRS). No difference was found for malaria prevalence or haemoglobin. 
Unstable malaria (EIR < 1): Two studies; for incidence and prevalence, the malaria rates were higher in the IRS group compared to the ITN group in one study. Malaria incidence was higher in the IRS arm in India (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.48) and in South Africa (risk ratio 1.34 but the cluster unadjusted CIs included 1). For malaria prevalence, ITNs appeared to give better protection against any infection compared to IRS in India (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.70) and also for both P. falciparum (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.78) and P. vivax (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.37). 
Authors' conclusions
Historical and programme documentation has clearly established the impact of IRS. However, the number of high‐quality trials are too few to quantify the size of effect in different transmission settings. The evidence from randomized comparisons of IRS versus no IRS confirms that IRS reduces malaria incidence in unstable malaria settings, but randomized trial data from stable malaria settings is very limited. Some limited data suggest that ITN give better protection than IRS in unstable areas, but more trials are needed to compare the effects of ITNs with IRS, as well as to quantify their combined effects. Ideally future trials should try and evaluate the effect of IRS in areas with no previous history of malaria control activities.","Indoor residual spraying for preventing malaria
Spraying houses with insecticides (indoor residual spraying; IRS) to kill mosquitoes is one of the main methods that have been used to control malaria on a large scale. IRS has helped to eliminate malaria from great parts of Asia, Russia, Europe, and Latin America, and successful IRS programmes have also been run in parts of Africa. 
Another successful method of mosquito control relies on the use of physical barriers such as bednets or curtains that can also be sprayed with insecticides (insecticide treated nets; ITN). This review aims to look at the health benefits of IRS and to compare this method with ITNs. 
This review does not assess the potentially adverse effects of insecticides used for IRS, and it includes not only randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but also controlled before‐and‐after studies (CBA) and interrupted time series (ITS), as these methods were considered suitably rigorous. 
Six studies were identified for inclusion (four cluster RCTs, one CBA and one ITS). Four of these studies were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa, one in India and one in Pakistan. IRS reduced malaria transmission in young children by half compared to no IRS in Tanzania (an area where people are regularly exposed to malaria), and protected all age groups in India and Pakistan (where malaria transmission is more unstable and where more than one type of malaria is found).   
When compared with ITNs, IRS appeared more protective (according to the outcome chosen) in one trial conducted in an area of stable malaria transmission, but ITN seemed to be more protective than IRS in unstable areas. Unfortunately, the level of evidence is very limited and no firm conclusions should be drawn on the basis of this review. 
In conclusion, although IRS programmes have shown impressive success in malaria reduction throughout the world, there are too few well‐run trials to be able to quantify the effects of IRS in areas with different malaria transmission, or to properly compare IRS and ITN.  High‐quality and long‐duration trials on a large scale, done in areas where there has been little or no mosquito control are still urgently required. New trials should include an IRS arm and an ITN arm, and should also assess the combined effect of ITN and IRS, a very important question in view of malaria elimination.","# Plain Language Summary: Indoor Spraying to Prevent Malaria

## What is this study about?

This study looked at research on indoor residual spraying (IRS)—a method where insecticide is sprayed inside homes to kill mosquitoes that carry malaria. The researchers wanted to understand how well IRS works to prevent malaria and how it compares to another method called insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), which are mosquito nets treated with insecticide.

## Why is this important?

Malaria is a serious disease spread by mosquitoes. IRS has been used for many years to prevent malaria, but scientists had never carefully measured how well it actually works. This study helps answer that question.

## What did they do?

Researchers looked at all high-quality studies comparing:
- IRS versus no spraying
- IRS versus treated mosquito nets

They searched for studies done between 1966 and 2009 in different parts of the world.

## What did they find?

**IRS versus no spraying:**
- In areas where malaria is common, IRS reduced malaria in some groups but not others
- In areas where malaria is rare, IRS worked well—it reduced malaria cases by 31% to 88%

**IRS versus treated nets:**
- In areas where malaria is rare, treated nets seemed to work better than IRS
- There wasn't enough information from areas where malaria is common to make a clear comparison

## What does this mean?

IRS does help prevent malaria, especially in areas where malaria is not very common. However, scientists need more studies to know for sure which method works best in different places.","### Plain Language Summary

This study looks at how well indoor spraying and special mosquito nets stop malaria. Indoor spraying puts insect-killing chemicals inside homes, while the nets are treated with insecticide.

**Purpose of the Study:**
To find out how effective indoor spraying is at preventing malaria and see how it compares to using mosquito nets.

**Who Was Studied:**
The study reviewed different experiments where people were protected with either indoor spraying, mosquito nets, or nothing, in places where malaria is common.

**Methods:**
Researchers looked at past studies and talked to experts. They used experiments where groups either had indoor spraying or mosquito nets, and checked how often people got malaria.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Indoor Spraying vs. No Spraying:**
   - In Tanzania, spraying reduced malaria in young children.
   - In Nigeria, spraying helped prevent malaria in the rainy season.
   - In Mozambique, spraying greatly reduced malaria over several years.
   - In India and Pakistan, spraying significantly lowered malaria rates.

2. **Indoor Spraying vs. Mosquito Nets:**
   - In Tanzania, nets seemed slightly better but results were close.
   - In unstable malaria areas like India and South Africa, nets were better at preventing malaria than spraying.

**Conclusions:**
Indoor spraying helps reduce malaria, but nets might work better in some areas. More studies are needed to compare spraying and nets, and to try spraying where malaria protection hasn’t been done before.

**Safety and Timing:**
The safety of these methods wasn't a main focus, and researchers stress the need for more detailed studies to understand how these tools work in different places."
"Background
This is an update of the original Cochrane review, last published in 2009 (Huertas‐Ceballos 2009). Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP), including children with irritable bowel syndrome, is a common problem affecting between 4% and 25% of school‐aged children. For the majority of such children, no organic cause for their pain can be found on physical examination or investigation. Many dietary inventions have been suggested to improve the symptoms of RAP. These may involve either excluding ingredients from the diet or adding supplements such as fibre or probiotics. 
Objectives
To examine the effectiveness of dietary interventions in improving pain in children of school age with RAP. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, eight other databases, and two trials registers, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors, in June 2016. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing dietary interventions with placebo or no treatment in children aged five to 18 years with RAP or an abdominal pain‐related, functional gastrointestinal disorder, as defined by the Rome III criteria (Rasquin 2006). 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We grouped dietary interventions together by category for analysis. We contacted study authors to ask for missing information and clarification, when needed. We assessed the quality of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 19 RCTs, reported in 27 papers with a total of 1453 participants. Fifteen of these studies were not included in the previous review. All 19 RCTs had follow‐up ranging from one to five months. Participants were aged between four and 18 years from eight different countries and were recruited largely from paediatric gastroenterology clinics. The mean age at recruitment ranged from 6.3 years to 13.1 years. Girls outnumbered boys in most trials. Fourteen trials recruited children with a diagnosis under the broad umbrella of RAP or functional gastrointestinal disorders; five trials specifically recruited only children with irritable bowel syndrome. The studies fell into four categories: trials of probiotic‐based interventions (13 studies), trials of fibre‐based interventions (four studies), trials of low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) diets (one study), and trials of fructose‐restricted diets (one study). 
We found that children treated with probiotics reported a greater reduction in pain frequency at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.98 to ‐0.12; 6 trials; 523 children). There was also a decrease in pain intensity in the intervention group at the same time point (SMD ‐0.50, 95% CI ‐0.85 to ‐0.15; 7 studies; 575 children). However, we judged the evidence for these outcomes to be of low quality using GRADE due to an unclear risk of bias from incomplete outcome data and significant heterogeneity. 
We found that children treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (odds ratio (OR) 1.63, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.47; 7 studies; 722 children). The estimated number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was eight, meaning that eight children would need to receive probiotics for one to experience improvement in pain in this timescale. We judged the evidence for this outcome to be of moderate quality due to significant heterogeneity. 
Children with a symptom profile defined as irritable bowel syndrome treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.77 to 5.13; 4 studies; 344 children). Children treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at three to six months postintervention compared to those receiving placebo (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.43; 2 studies; 224 children). We judged the evidence for these two outcomes to be of moderate quality due to small numbers of participants included in the studies. 
We found that children treated with fibre‐based interventions were not more likely to experience an improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention than children given placebo (OR 1.83, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.65; 2 studies; 136 children). There was also no reduction in pain intensity compared to placebo at the same time point (SMD ‐1.24, 95% CI ‐3.41 to 0.94; 2 studies; 135 children). We judged the evidence for these outcomes to be of low quality due to an unclear risk of bias, imprecision, and significant heterogeneity. 
We found only one study of low FODMAP diets and only one trial of fructose‐restricted diets, meaning no pooled analyses were possible. 
We were unable to perform any meta‐analyses for the secondary outcomes of school performance, social or psychological functioning, or quality of daily life, as not enough studies included these outcomes or used comparable measures to assess them. 
With the exception of one study, all studies reported monitoring children for adverse events; no major adverse events were reported. 
Authors' conclusions
Overall, we found moderate‐ to low‐quality evidence suggesting that probiotics may be effective in improving pain in children with RAP. Clinicians may therefore consider probiotic interventions as part of a holistic management strategy. However, further trials are needed to examine longer‐term outcomes and to improve confidence in estimating the size of the effect, as well as to determine the optimal strain and dosage. Future research should also explore the effectiveness of probiotics in children with different symptom profiles, such as those with irritable bowel syndrome. 
We found only a small number of trials of fibre‐based interventions, with overall low‐quality evidence for the outcomes. There was therefore no convincing evidence that fibre‐based interventions improve pain in children with RAP. Further high‐quality RCTs of fibre supplements involving larger numbers of participants are required. Future trials of low FODMAP diets and other dietary interventions are also required to facilitate evidence‐based recommendations.","Dietary interventions for recurrent abdominal pain in children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of dietary interventions on pain in children aged between five and 18 years with recurrent abdominal pain (RAP). 
Background 
Recurrent abdominal pain, or RAP, is a term used for unexplained episodes of stomachache or abdominal pain in children. Recurrent abdominal pain is a common condition, and most children are likely to be helped by simple measures. However, a range of treatments have been recommended to relieve abdominal pain, including making changes to the child's eating habits by adding supplements or excluding certain foods. 
Study characteristics 
This evidence is current to June 2016.
Nineteen studies met our inclusion criteria, including 13 studies of probiotics and four studies of fibre interventions. We also found one study of a diet low in substances known as FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) and one study of a fructose‐restricted diet. 
All of the studies compared dietary interventions to a placebo or control. The trials were carried out in eight countries and included a total of 1453 participants, aged between five and 18 years. Most children were recruited from outpatient clinics. Most interventions lasted four to six weeks. 
Key results 
Probiotics 
We found evidence from 13 studies suggesting that probiotics might be effective in improving pain in the shorter term. Most studies did not report on other areas such as quality of daily life. No harmful effects were reported, other than dry mouth in one study. We judged this evidence to be of moderate or low quality because some studies were small, showed varying results, or were at risk of bias. 
Fibre supplements 
We found no clear evidence of improvement of pain from four studies of fibre supplements. Most studies did not report on other areas such as quality of daily life. No harmful effects were reported. There were few studies of fibre supplements, and some of these studies were at risk of bias. We judged this evidence to be of low quality. 
Low FODMAP diets 
We found only one study evaluating the effectiveness of low FODMAP diets in children with RAP. 
Fructose‐restricted diets 
We found only one study evaluating the effectiveness of fructose‐restricted diets in children with RAP. 
Conclusion 
We found some evidence suggesting that probiotics may be helpful in relieving pain in children with RAP in the short term. Clinicians may therefore consider probiotic interventions as part of the management strategy for RAP. Further trials are needed to find out how effective probiotics are over longer periods of time and which probiotics might work best. 
We did not find convincing evidence that fibre supplements are effective in improving pain in children with RAP. Future larger, high‐quality studies are needed to test the effectiveness of fibre and low FODMAP diet treatments.","# Plain Language Summary: Dietary Treatments for Belly Pain in Children

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether changing a child's diet can help reduce recurring belly pain. Between 4 and 25 out of every 100 school-aged children have this problem. Doctors usually can't find a clear reason for the pain when they examine these children or run tests.

## Who was studied?

The review included 19 research studies with a total of 1,453 children ages 4–18 years from eight countries. Most children were recruited from pediatric hospitals. More girls than boys participated in the studies.

## What treatments were tested?

The studies tested four types of dietary changes:
- **Probiotics** (helpful bacteria): 13 studies
- **Fiber supplements**: 4 studies
- **Low FODMAP diets** (avoiding certain carbohydrates): 1 study
- **Fructose-restricted diets** (limiting a type of sugar): 1 study

## What were the main findings?

**Probiotics worked best:**
- Children taking probiotics had less belly pain and pain happened less often compared to children taking a fake treatment
- About 1 out of every 8 children taking probiotics felt better
- Children with irritable bowel syndrome showed even better improvement
- Benefits lasted 3–6 months

**Fiber didn't help:**
- Children taking fiber supplements didn't feel better than those taking a fake treatment

**Other diets:**
- Too few studies tested low FODMAP and fructose-restricted diets to know if they work

## How long did studies last?

All studies followed children for 1–5 months.

## Were there side effects?

Almost all studies checked for harmful side effects. No serious problems were reported.

## What do the researchers recommend?

Doctors may consider probiotics as part of treating belly pain in children. However, more research is needed to find the best type and dose of probiotics and to see if benefits last longer than 6 months.","### Plain Language Summary

**Background**

This study looked at ways to help children with recurring stomach pain, which is a common issue. Many times, doctors can't find a physical reason for the pain. Some suggest changing diets by adding or removing certain foods.

**Objective**

The main goal was to see if changing diets helps school-aged kids with stomach pain feel better.

**Method**

Researchers examined studies comparing diet changes to no treatment in children aged 5 to 18 with stomach pain. They looked at different foods and supplements like probiotics and fiber.

**Results**

- **Participants:** The study included 1,453 children from 8 countries, mostly girls, aged 4 to 18.
- **Diet Types:** There were four main diet changes studied: probiotics, fiber, low FODMAP, and less fructose.
- **Findings on Probiotics:** Children who took probiotics had less pain after 3 months than those who didn’t. About 1 in 8 children felt better thanks to probiotics. This evidence is not very strong but somewhat promising.
- **Findings on Fiber:** Adding fiber didn’t show clear benefits in reducing pain.
- **Other Diets:** Only one study each looked at low FODMAP and fructose-restricted diets, so there isn't enough information to say if these help.

**Safety**

Most studies checked for side effects, and no major issues were found.

**Conclusions**

Probiotics might help lessen pain in kids with stomach issues, but more research is needed to be sure and to find the best kind. There's no strong proof yet that fiber helps. More studies on different diets are necessary.

**What’s Next?**

Researchers suggest looking into probiotics more to see how they work in the long run and testing diets like low FODMAP in future studies."
"Background
Preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) is associated with increased risk of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Women with PPROM have been predominantly managed in hospital. It is possible that selected women could be managed at home after a period of observation. The safety, cost and women's views about home management have not been established. 
Objectives
To assess the safety, cost and women's views about planned home versus hospital care for women with PPROM. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 July 2013) and the reference lists of all the identified articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials comparing planned home versus hospital management for women with PPROM before 37 weeks' gestation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed clinical trials for eligibility for inclusion, risk of bias, and carried out data extraction. 
Main results
We included two trials (116 women) comparing planned home versus hospital management for PPROM. Overall, the number of included women in each trial was too small to allow adequate assessment of pre‐specified outcomes. Investigators used strict inclusion criteria and in both studies relatively few of the women presenting with PPROM were eligible for inclusion. Women were monitored for 48 to 72 hours before randomisation. Perinatal mortality was reported in one trial and there was insufficient evidence to determine whether it differed between the two groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 20.05).  There was no evidence of differences between groups for serious neonatal morbidity, chorioamnionitis, gestational age at delivery, birthweight and admission to neonatal intensive care. 
There was no information on serious maternal morbidity or mortality. There was some evidence that women managed in hospital were more likely to be delivered by caesarean section (RR (random‐effects) 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.15). However, results should be interpreted cautiously as there is moderate heterogeneity for this outcome (I² = 35%). Mothers randomised to care at home spent approximately 10 fewer days as inpatients (mean difference ‐9.60, 95% CI ‐14.59 to ‐4.61) and were more satisfied with their care. Furthermore, home care was associated with reduced costs. 
Authors' conclusions
The review included two relatively small studies that did not have sufficient statistical power to detect meaningful differences between groups. Future large and adequately powered randomised controlled trials are required to measure differences between groups for relevant pre‐specified outcomes. Special attention should be given to the assessment of maternal satisfaction with care and cost analysis as they will have social and economic implications in both developed and developing countries.","Planned home versus hospital care for rupture of the membranes before 37 weeks' gestation
Premature rupture of membranes before 37 weeks’ gestation (and where there is at least an hour between membrane rupture and the onset of contractions and labour) can have consequences for both the mother and the baby. It is estimated that after premature rupture of the membranes one‐half of women go into labour within a week, and three‐quarters within a fortnight. This means that the baby may be born prematurely and both mother and baby are at risk of infection. Where available, the majority of clinicians advise hospital care for the women to allow monitoring and early detection of any problems. It is however possible for some women to go home after a period of observation in hospital. The safety, cost and women's views about home management have not been established. 
We included two randomised controlled studies with 116 women in the review. These studies compared planned home versus hospital management for women with preterm, prelabour rupture of the membranes (PPROM). In both studies there were strict criteria for deciding whether women could be included; for example, women had to live within a certain distance of emergency facilities, and there had to be no signs that mothers and babies had infection or other problems. There was a period of monitoring in hospital for women in both groups. 
Results suggested that there were few differences in mothers' and babies' health for women cared for at home or in hospital including infant death, serious illness, or admission to intensive care baby units. 
There was some evidence that women managed in hospital were more likely to be delivered by caesarean section. Women cared for at home were likely to spend less time in hospital (spending approximately 10 fewer days as inpatients) and were more satisfied with their care. In addition, home care was associated with reduced costs. Overall, the number of women included in the two studies was too small to allow adequate assessment of outcomes.","# Plain Language Summary: Home Care vs. Hospital Care for Pregnancy Complications

## What is this study about?

This review looked at two research studies comparing two ways to care for pregnant women with a serious condition called PPROM (when the bag of fluid around the baby breaks before labor starts, before 37 weeks of pregnancy). The question was: Is it safe for some of these women to stay home instead of staying in the hospital?

## Who was in the studies?

The two studies included 116 pregnant women total with PPROM. All women were watched carefully in the hospital for 2–3 days first. Then doctors decided which women were healthy enough to possibly go home.

## What did the studies test?

**Home care group:** Women went home and were monitored from there.

**Hospital care group:** Women stayed in the hospital.

Researchers looked at:
- Safety for mom and baby
- How many days women spent in the hospital
- Whether women needed surgery (cesarean section)
- How satisfied women were with their care
- Cost of care

## What were the results?

**Safety:** The studies were too small to clearly show whether one approach was safer. There were no major differences in serious baby problems or infections between the two groups.

**Hospital stays:** Women who stayed home spent about 10 fewer days in the hospital.

**Satisfaction:** Women who stayed home were more satisfied with their care.

**Cost:** Home care cost less money.

**Surgery:** Women in the hospital group may have been more likely to have cesarean sections, but the studies were too small to be sure.

## What does this mean?

These two studies were too small to prove home care is definitely safe. Larger studies are needed before doctors can confidently recommend home care for PPROM.","### Summary of a Clinical Trial on PPROM Care

This study looked at caring for women with a condition called PPROM, which affects pregnant women before the baby is full-term. Usually, women with PPROM stay in the hospital, but this study explored if some women could safely stay at home instead.

**Purpose of the Study:**
The study aimed to find out if home care is as safe as hospital care for women with PPROM. It also looked at costs and how women felt about their care.

**What Did They Do?**
- Researchers looked at trials where women with PPROM were planned to stay at home or in the hospital.
- Two small studies with 116 women were reviewed.
- Women were watched for 48 to 72 hours before being placed in either group.

**Findings:**
- Not enough evidence to clearly say if home care is as safe as hospital care because the study was too small.
- Both groups had similar results for baby health and birth weight.
- There was not enough information on mothers' health problems.
- Some evidence suggested women in the hospital might have more C-sections, but this isn’t certain.
- Women at home spent about 10 fewer days in the hospital and felt happier with their care.
- Home care was also less expensive.

**Conclusion:**
The study wasn’t big enough to make strong conclusions. More research is needed to see if home care is truly safe and how it impacts costs and mothers' satisfaction. This is important for both richer and poorer countries."
"Background
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common, life‐limiting, genetically inherited disease. It affects multiple organs, particularly the respiratory system. However, gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) are also important and well‐recognised complications in CF. They share similar symptoms e.g. bloating, abdominal pain, but are distinct conditions. Constipation occurs when there is gradual faecal impaction of the colon, but DIOS occurs when there is an accumulation of faeces and sticky mucus, forming a mass in the distal part of the small intestine. The mass may partially block the intestine (incomplete DIOS) or completely block the intestine (complete DIOS). Symptoms of DIOS can affect quality of life and other aspects of CF health, such as airway clearance, exercise, sleep and nutritional status. Treatment of constipation and prevention of complete bowel obstruction are required for gastrointestinal management in CF. However, many different strategies are used in clinical practice and there is a lack of consensus. The importance of this topic was highlighted in a recent research priority setting exercise by the James Lind Alliance. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of laxative agents of differing types for preventing DIOS (complete and incomplete) in children and adults with CF. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of search: 09 September 2021. 
We also searched online trial registries. Date of last search: 12 October 2021.
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled parallel trials comparing laxative therapy for preventing DIOS (including osmotic agents, stimulants, mucolytics and substances with more than one action) at any dose to placebo, no treatment or an alternative laxative therapy, in people of any age with pancreatic sufficient or insufficient CF and any stage of lung disease. Randomised cross‐over trials were judged on an individual basis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted outcome data and performed a risk of bias assessment for the included data. We judged the certainty of the evidence using GRADE criteria. 
Main results
We included one cross‐over trial (17 participants) with a duration of 12 months, in which participants were randomly allocated to either cisapride (a gastro‐prokinetic agent) or placebo for six months each. The trial had an unclear risk of bias for most domains but had a high risk of reporting bias. 
Radiograph scores revealed no difference in occurrence of DIOS between cisapride and placebo (narrative report, no data provided). There were no adverse effects. Symptom scores were the only secondary outcome within the review that were reported. Total gastrointestinal symptom scores favoured cisapride with a statistically significant mean difference (MD) of ‐7.60 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐14.73 to ‐0.47). There was no significant difference at six months between cisapride and placebo for abdominal distension, MD ‐0.90 (95% CI ‐2.39 to 0.59) or abdominal pain, MD ‐0.4 (95% CI ‐2.05 to 1.25). The global symptom scores (whether individuals felt better or worse) were reported in the paper to favour cisapride and be statistically significant (P < 0.05). 
We assessed the available data to be very low certainty. There was a great deal of missing data from the included trial and the investigators failed to report numerical data for many outcomes. The overall risk of bias of the trial was unclear and it had a high risk for reporting bias. There was also indirectness; the trial drug (cisapride) has since been removed from the market in several countries due to adverse effects, thus it has no current applicability for preventing DIOS. The included trial also had very few participants, which downgraded the certainty a further level for precision. 
Authors' conclusions
There is an absence of evidence for interventions for the prevention of DIOS. As there was only one included trial, we could not perform a meta‐analysis of the data. Furthermore, the included trial compared a prokinetic agent (cisapride) that is no longer licensed for use in a number of countries due to the risk of serious cardiac events, a finding that came to light after the trial was conducted. Therefore, the limited findings from the trial are not applicable in current clinical practice. 
Overall, a great deal more research needs to be undertaken on gastrointestinal complications in CF, as this is a very poorly studied area compared to respiratory complications in CF.","Which interventions are effective and safe for preventing distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) in cystic fibrosis? 
Background 
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited, life‐long condition that causes organ systems in the body to produce large amounts of thick and sticky mucus. The most commonly affected area is the lungs, in which thick mucus leads to recurrent chest infections and breathing difficulties. Another commonly affected area is the digestive system. Many people with CF suffer from bloating and abdominal pain which may be caused by constipation or distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). In DIOS, overproduction of thick mucus combines with stool and sticks to the intestinal wall. This mass can partially block the intestine (incomplete DIOS) or completely block the intestine (complete DIOS). The latter causes severe pain, vomiting and is treated as a medical emergency. As part of effective care for people with CF, constipation should therefore be treated and complete bowel obstruction be prevented. It is also important to recognise that constipation and DIOS impact on other aspects of CF health. Bloating, abdominal pain and nausea may affect airway clearance, exercise and sleep. Nutritional status may also be affected due to decreased appetite and malabsorption. DIOS may affect the absorption of other medications taken by people with CF. Overall, DIOS can significantly impair quality of life. Different laxatives are currently used in clinics, but prescribing practices differ and there is no consensus on optimal treatment strategies. Hence, this review aimed to analyse the evidence for the preventing DIOS. 
Search date 
We last searched for evidence: 12 October 2021.
Trial characteristics 
We included one trial in the review, which included 17 people aged between 13 to 35 years. These people were randomly put into groups to take either a placebo drug (with no active medication) or cisapride for six months each and then to cross over and take the alternative treatment for a further six months. 
Key results 
The trial used radiography to diagnose DIOS, but did not provide any data and only stated that there was no difference between cisapride and placebo. The trial also stated that there were no adverse effects from the cisapride. The trial assessed participant‐reported total and individual gastrointestinal symptom scores. People in the cisapride group reported an improvement in total gastrointestinal symptom scores compared to those in the placebo group. However, there were no differences reported between groups for the individual symptom scores of abdominal pain and abdominal distension (swelling). Participants also reported global symptom scores, which showed that most people felt better taking cisapride compared to placebo. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The overall certainty of the evidence was very low. With one trial in this review, we could not combine data from different trials. The trial did not provide enough information about the methods used for allocating participants or about missing data and did not fully report certain results. The small number of participants also lowered the precision of the results. Since this trial was conducted, cisapride has been removed from the market in a number of countries due to rare but serious heart complications, therefore it has no applicability to current clinical practice.","# Plain Language Summary: Laxatives for Preventing Bowel Blockages in Cystic Fibrosis

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether different types of laxatives (medicines that help with bowel movements) can prevent a serious bowel problem in people with cystic fibrosis (CF).

## Why does this matter?

People with CF often have stomach and intestinal problems, including constipation and a condition called DIOS. DIOS happens when stool and sticky mucus build up and block the small intestine. This blockage can cause bloating, belly pain, and make it harder for people to breathe, exercise, sleep, and eat well. Doctors use different laxatives to try to prevent these problems, but there's no agreement on which ones work best.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for studies that tested different laxatives in people with CF. They looked for studies that compared laxatives to a placebo (fake medicine) or to other laxatives.

## What did they find?

The researchers found only **one study** with 17 people. This study tested a medicine called cisapride against a placebo for 6 months each. 

**Results:**
- X-rays showed no difference in bowel blockages between the two groups
- People taking cisapride reported fewer overall stomach symptoms
- No serious side effects were reported
- However, cisapride is no longer used in many countries because it can cause heart problems

## Bottom line

There is **not enough evidence** to know which laxatives work best for preventing bowel blockages in CF. Much more research is needed on this topic.","### Plain Language Summary

#### What Was This Study About?

This study looked at a condition linked to cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disease that can make life harder. People with CF can have problems like constipation and a blockage in the intestines called DIOS. The study wanted to see if certain medicines could help prevent DIOS.

#### Who Was Involved?

The study included 17 people with cystic fibrosis. They were randomly given either a medicine called cisapride or a placebo (a pill that doesn’t do anything) for six months each.

#### What Did They Do?

The researchers wanted to see if taking cisapride or a placebo would prevent DIOS. They also checked for any side effects.

#### What Did They Find?

- The study found no clear difference in the blockage between cisapride and the placebo.
- There were no side effects reported.
- Some symptoms seemed a bit better with cisapride, but the difference wasn’t strong.

#### How Sure Are We?

The results were uncertain because:
- The study had missing information.
- The medicine tested is no longer available in some countries because of safety issues.
- There were only a few people in the study, which makes the results less reliable.

#### Conclusion

Right now, there isn’t enough evidence to say what works for preventing DIOS in people with CF. More research is needed because this is an important area that hasn't been studied much."
"Background
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, yet ASCVD risk factor control and secondary prevention rates remain low. A fixed‐dose combination of blood pressure‐ and cholesterol‐lowering and antiplatelet treatments into a single pill, or polypill, has been proposed as one strategy to reduce the global burden of ASCVD. 
Objectives
To determine the effect of fixed‐dose combination therapy on all‐cause mortality, fatal and non‐fatal ASCVD events, and adverse events. We also sought to determine the effect of fixed‐dose combination therapy on blood pressure, lipids, adherence, discontinuation rates, health‐related quality of life, and costs. 
Search methods
We updated our previous searches in September 2016 of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ISI Web of Science, and DARE, HTA, and HEED. We also searched two clinical trials registers in September 2016. We used no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of a fixed‐dose combination therapy including at least one blood pressure‐lowering and one lipid‐lowering component versus usual care, placebo, or an active drug comparator for any treatment duration in adults 18 years old or older, with no restrictions on presence or absence of pre‐existing ASCVD. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted the data for this update. We evaluated risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using fixed‐effect models when heterogeneity was low (I2 < 50%) and random‐effects models when heterogeneity was high (I2 ≥ 50%). We used the GRADE approach to evaluate the quality of evidence. 
Main results
In the initial review, we identified nine randomised controlled trials with a total of 7047 participants and four additional trials (n = 2012 participants; mean age range 62 to 63 years; 30% to 37% women) were included in this update. Eight of the 13 trials evaluated the effects of fixed‐dose combination (FDC) therapy in populations without prevalent ASCVD, and the median follow‐up ranged from six weeks to 23 months. More recent trials were generally larger with longer follow‐up and lower risk of bias. The main risk of bias was related to lack of blinding of participants and personnel, which was inherent to the intervention. Compared with the comparator groups (placebo, usual care, or active drug comparator), the effects of the fixed‐dose combination treatment on mortality (FDC = 1.0% versus control = 1.0%, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.89,  I2 = 0%, 5 studies, N = 5300) and fatal and non‐fatal ASCVD events (FDC = 4.7% versus control = 3.7%, RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.66, I2 = 0%, 6 studies, N = 4517) were uncertain (low‐quality evidence). The low event rates for these outcomes and indirectness of evidence for comparing fixed‐dose combination to usual care versus individual drugs suggest that these results should be viewed with caution. Adverse events were common in both the intervention (32%) and comparator (27%) groups, with participants randomised to fixed‐dose combination therapy being 16% (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.25, 11 studies, 6906 participants, moderate‐quality evidence) more likely to report an adverse event . The mean differences in systolic blood pressure between the intervention and control arms was ‐6.34 mmHg (95% CI ‐9.03 to ‐3.64, 13 trials, 7638 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). The mean differences (95% CI) in total and LDL cholesterol between the intervention and control arms were ‐0.61 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.88 to ‐0.35, 11 trials, 6565 participants, low‐quality evidence) and ‐0.70 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.98 to ‐0.41, 12 trials, 7153 participants, moderate‐quality evidence), respectively. There was a high degree of statistical heterogeneity in comparisons of blood pressure and lipids (I2 ≥ 80% for all) that could not be explained, so these results should be viewed with caution. Fixed‐dose combination therapy improved adherence to a multidrug strategy by 44% (26% to 65%) compared with usual care (4 trials, 3835 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
The effects of fixed‐dose combination therapy on all‐cause mortality or ASCVD events are uncertain. A limited number of trials reported these outcomes, and the included trials were primarily designed to observe changes in ASCVD risk factor levels rather than clinical events, which may partially explain the observed differences in risk factors that were not translated into differences in clinical outcomes among the included trials. Fixed‐dose combination therapy is associated with modest increases in adverse events compared with placebo, active comparator, or usual care but may be associated with improved adherence to a multidrug regimen. Ongoing, longer‐term trials of fixed‐dose combination therapy will help demonstrate whether short‐term changes in risk factors might be maintained and lead to expected differences in clinical events based on these changes.","Fixed‐dose combination drug therapy for the prevention of heart disease and stroke
Review question: We reviewed the evidence about the effect of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy on the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. We found 13 studies including 9059 participants. 
Background: We wanted to discover whether using fixed‐dose combination therapy was better or worse than other alternatives, such as usual care, placebo, or giving drugs separately, for the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. This report represents an update from a previous review published in 2014. 
Study characteristics: The evidence is current to September 2016. Four studies included individuals with a prior heart attack or stroke or with a high predicted risk for having an initial heart attack and five studies had long‐term (12 months or more) follow‐up. The main risk of bias was related to lack of blinding of participants and personnel, which was inherent to the intervention. Most study participants were middle‐aged men with moderate elevations in blood pressure or cholesterol. Two studies specifically included ethnic Aboriginal or Maori minorities in half of the study participants. The fixed‐dose combinations ranged from two to five drugs; all studies included at least one blood pressure‐lowering and one cholesterol‐lowering drug. 
Key results: The effects of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy on all‐cause mortality and fatal and non‐fatal heart attacks and strokes are uncertain, primarily due to the low number of participants experiencing these events in these studies (fewer than 5% for both) and comparisons with usual care (low‐quality evidence). Fixed‐dose combination drug therapy leads to more adverse events than control (32% versus 27%), including placebo (moderate‐quality evidence). This information is not surprising since aspirin, blood pressure‐lowering drugs and cholesterol drugs are known to increase the risk for side effects compared with placebo. Fixed‐dose combination therapy may modestly lower blood pressure (˜6 mmHg) and cholesterol (‐0.6 mmol/L in LDL cholesterol), but these effects were not consistent (moderate‐quality evidence for blood pressure and LDL cholesterol but low‐quality evidence of total cholesterol). Fixed‐dose combination therapy appears to improve adherence to medications to prevent ASCVD (moderate‐quality evidence). 
Quality of the evidence: The quality of evidence from these studies generally ranged from moderate to low. Ongoing trials of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy will likely inform clinical endpoints to guide decision‐making.","# Plain Language Summary: Fixed-Dose Combination Pills for Heart and Blood Vessel Health

## What is this study about?

This study looked at whether a single pill containing multiple heart and blood pressure medicines works better than taking separate pills. Researchers wanted to know if this ""combination pill"" could help people stay healthier and live longer.

## Why does this matter?

Heart and blood vessel disease is a major cause of death and disability around the world. Many people don't take their medicines as prescribed, which makes their condition worse. A single pill with multiple medicines might make it easier for people to remember to take their medications.

## What did researchers do?

Scientists reviewed 13 research studies that tested combination pills. These studies included about 9,000 people, with an average age of 62–63 years. About 30–37% of participants were women. The studies compared people taking a combination pill to people taking regular treatment, fake pills, or individual medicines. Studies lasted from 6 weeks to 23 months.

## What did they find?

**Deaths and heart events:** The combination pill did not clearly prevent deaths or heart attacks/strokes better than regular treatment.

**Side effects:** About 32% of people taking the combination pill had side effects, compared to 27% in the comparison groups. People on the combination pill were 16% more likely to report side effects.

**Blood pressure and cholesterol:** The combination pill did lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels more than comparison treatments, but the differences were small.

**Taking medicine as prescribed:** People taking the combination pill were much more likely to take their medicines regularly (44% improvement).

## Bottom line

The combination pill makes it easier for people to remember to take their medicines. It does lower blood pressure and cholesterol somewhat. However, we don't yet know if it actually prevents more deaths or heart attacks. Longer studies are needed to answer this question.","### Plain Language Summary

This study looked at whether taking a single pill that combines medicines for lowering blood pressure, cholesterol, and preventing blood clots can help reduce heart-related deaths and health problems. The idea is that this ""polypill"" could make it easier for people to take their medication regularly and stay healthier.

**What We Wanted to Know:**
- Can this combined pill lower the chance of death from any cause?
- Does it reduce serious heart-related health issues?
- Are there any side effects?
- How does it affect things like blood pressure and cholesterol levels?

**Who Was Studied:**
- Adults 18 years and older, with or without existing heart issues, were included in the trials.

**What We Did:**
- We looked at several studies where people were either given the polypill or their usual care (or a placebo).
- We reviewed research from databases up until September 2016.

**What We Found:**
- There were 13 studies with a total of more than 9,000 people. Most of these studies lasted from about six weeks to almost two years.
- People taking the combined pill had slightly lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
- More people taking the polypill reported side effects compared to those on regular care or a placebo.
- The improvement in sticking to medication was higher for those on the polypill.

**Conclusions:**
- It's not clear if the polypill reduces deaths or serious heart problems, since not all studies reported these outcomes.
- The polypill showed some promise in helping people manage their medications better.
- More and longer-term studies are needed to see if these short-term benefits improve long-term health.

In summary, while the polypill could help with medication management, more research is needed to confirm any long-term health benefits."
"Background
Appendiceal phlegmon and abscess account for 2% to 10% of acute appendicitis. People with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess usually need an appendicectomy to relieve their symptoms and avoid complications. The timing of appendicectomy for appendiceal phlegmon or abscess is controversial. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of early versus delayed appendicectomy for appendiceal phlegmon or abscess, in terms of overall morbidity and mortality. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 7), MEDLINE Ovid (1950 to 23 August 2016), Embase Ovid (1974 to 23 August 2016), Science Citation Index Expanded (1900 to 23 August 2016), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) (1978 to 23 August 2016). We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform search portal (23 August 2016) and ClinicalTrials.gov (23 August 2016) for ongoing trials. 
Selection criteria
We included all individual and cluster‐randomised controlled trials, irrespective of language, publication status, or age of participants, comparing early versus delayed appendicectomy in people with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently identified the trials for inclusion, collected the data, and assessed the risk of bias. We performed meta‐analyses using Review Manager 5. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
Main results
We included two randomised controlled trials with a total of 80 participants in this review. 
1. Early versus delayed open appendicectomy for appendiceal phlegmon 
Forty participants (paediatric and adults) with appendiceal phlegmon were randomised either to early appendicectomy (appendicectomy as soon as appendiceal mass resolved within the same admission) (n = 20), or to delayed appendicectomy (initial conservative treatment followed by interval appendicectomy six weeks later) (n = 20). The trial was at high risk of bias. There was no mortality in either group. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of using either early or delayed open appendicectomy onoverall morbidity (RR 13.00; 95% CI 0.78 to 216.39; very low‐quality evidence), the proportion of participants who developed wound infection (RR 9.00; 95% CI 0.52 to 156.91; very low quality evidence) or faecal fistula (RR 3.00; 95% CI 0.13 to 69.52; very low quality evidence). The quality of evidence for increased length of hospital stay and time away from normal activities in the early appendicectomy group (MD 6.70 days; 95% CI 2.76 to 10.64, and MD 5.00 days; 95% CI 1.52 to 8.48, respectively) is very low quality evidence. The trial reported neither quality of life nor pain outcomes. 
2. Early versus delayed laparoscopic appendicectomy for appendiceal abscess 
Forty paediatric participants with appendiceal abscess were randomised either to early appendicectomy (emergent laparoscopic appendicectomy) (n = 20) or to delayed appendicectomy (initial conservative treatment followed by interval laparoscopic appendicectomy 10 weeks later) (n = 20). The trial was at high risk of bias. The trial did not report on overall morbidity or complications. There was no mortality in either group. We do not have sufficient evidence to determine the effects of using either early or delayed laparoscopic appendicectomy for outcomes relating to hospital stay between the groups (MD −0.20 days; 95% CI −3.54 to 3.14; very low quality of evidence). Health‐related quality of life was measured with the Pediatric Quality of Life Scale‐Version 4.0 questionnaire (a scale of 0 to 100 with higher values indicating a better quality of life). Health‐related quality of life score measured at 12 weeks after appendicectomy was higher in the early appendicectomy group than in the delayed appendicectomy group (MD 12.40 points; 95% CI 9.78 to 15.02) but the quality of evidence was very low. This trial reported neither the pain nor the time away from normal activities. 
Authors' conclusions
It is unclear whether early appendicectomy prevents complications compared to delayed appendicectomy for people with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess. The evidence indicating increased length of hospital stay and time away from normal activities in people with early open appendicectomy is of very low quality. The evidence for better health‐related quality of life following early laparoscopic appendicectomy compared with delayed appendicectomy is based on very low quality evidence. For both comparisons addressed in this review, data are sparse, and we cannot rule out significant benefits or harms of early versus delayed appendicectomy. 
Further trials on this topic are urgently needed and should specify a set of criteria for use of antibiotics, percutaneous drainage of the appendiceal abscess prior to surgery and resolution of the appendiceal phlegmon or abscess. Future trials should include outcomes such as time away from normal activities, quality of life and the length of hospital stay.","Early or delayed surgical removal of appendix in people with symptomatic complicated appendicitis 
Review question 
What are the risks and benefits of early versus delayed removal of appendix in people with symptomatic complicated appendicitis? 
Background 
The human appendix is a tube at the connection of the small and the large intestines. Possible functions of the appendix may be to protect the body against infection and to maintain healthy levels bacteria in the gut when recovering from diarrhoea. Appendicitis covers a variety of clinical conditions resulting from inflammation of the appendix. 
Complicated appendicitis is defined as appendiceal phlegmon (simple inflammatory mass without pus located in bottom right of the appendix) or appendiceal abscess (pocket of pus surrounding an acutely inflamed and/or ruptured appendix). People with this condition usually need surgical removal of the appendix to relieve their symptoms and avoid complications. The timing of surgical removal of the appendix is controversial. Immediate surgery is technically demanding. Some experts question the appropriateness of delayed appendectomy, as people are unlikely to experience a recurrence after a successful non‐surgical treatment. However, the true diagnosis could be uncertain in some cases, and postponing the appendectomy may delay diagnosis of underlying disease. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for all relevant randomised controlled trials up to 23 August 2016. We identified two trials involving 80 participants. One compared early versus delayed open appendicectomy in 40 children and adults with appendiceal phlegmon. The other trial compared early versus delayed keyhole (laparoscopic) appendicectomy (where surgery is performed through a very small incision) in 40 children with appendiceal abscess. Studies took place in the USA and India. The age of the individuals in the trials varied between 1 year and 84 years, and 27.5% were females. 
Key results 
Both two studies were small and had a number of limitations so we cannot be certain about how the effects of the two surgical approaches compare. From one trial in children and adults comparing open with delayed appendicectomy, there was insufficient evidence to show the effect of using either approach on the overall complication rate or the proportion of participants who developed wound infection. Our certainty in a longer stay in hospital stay and time away from normal activities with open appendicectomy is very low. There were no deaths in the study. Quality of life, and pain were not reported in this trial. 
The other trial in children with appendiceal abscess receiving either early or delayed keyhole appendicectomy did not report on overall complication rates. The trial did not provide enough evidence to show the effect of using either approach on the length of hospital stay among participants. We have very low certainty that children who had early keyhole appendicectomy had better quality of life compared with children who had delayed keyhole appendicectomy. The study did not report if there were any deaths, and did not provide information on pain, or time away from normal activities. 
At present the benefits and harms of early versus delayed appendicectomy are not well understood because the current information is based upon very low quality evidence. 
Quality of the evidence 
Both trials were at a high risk of bias. Overall, we judged the quality of the evidence to be very low. Thus, further well‐designed trials are urgently needed.","# Plain Language Summary: Early vs. Delayed Surgery for Appendiceal Phlegmon or Abscess

## What is this study about?

Sometimes when people have appendicitis (inflammation of the appendix), a pocket of infected material called a phlegmon or abscess forms. This summary reviews research comparing two treatment approaches: operating on the appendix right away versus waiting and operating later.

## Who participated?

The review looked at two small studies with a total of 80 people (children and adults). One study had 40 people with appendiceal phlegmon, and the other had 40 children with appendiceal abscess.

## What were the two treatment approaches?

**Early surgery group:** People had their appendix removed as soon as the infected area improved, during the same hospital stay.

**Delayed surgery group:** People received medicines and other treatments first, then had surgery to remove their appendix 6–10 weeks later.

## What did researchers find?

- **Deaths:** No one died in either group.
- **Complications:** The studies didn't provide clear answers about which approach prevented problems better.
- **Hospital stay:** People who had early open surgery stayed in the hospital about 7 days longer.
- **Time away from activities:** People with early open surgery spent about 5 more days away from normal activities.
- **Quality of life:** Children who had early laparoscopic (minimally invasive) surgery reported better quality of life at 12 weeks compared to those who had delayed surgery.

## What do the researchers conclude?

The evidence is too weak to say whether early or delayed surgery is better. More research is needed to answer this question.","**Plain Language Summary:**

**Background:**
Sometimes, a part of the body called the appendix can get very sick and form a lump or abscess. This can happen in 2% to 10% of people with a condition called acute appendicitis. People usually need surgery to feel better and avoid more problems. But doctors aren’t sure about the best time to have this surgery.

**Purpose of the Study:**
The study looked at whether having surgery early or later is better for people with an appendix lump or abscess. They wanted to see which option led to fewer health issues and deaths.

**How They Did the Study:**
Researchers looked at many past studies from all over the world. They focused on studies comparing early surgery (soon after the lump goes away) and delayed surgery (waiting a few weeks).

**Who Was in the Study:**
The study included two small research trials with a total of 80 people. Some were kids, and some were adults.

**Findings:**

1. **Open Surgery for Appendix Lump:**
   - 40 people were split into two groups. One group had early surgery, and the other had surgery six weeks later.
   - No one died in either group.
   - There wasn't enough good information to know which timing was better for health problems or infections.
   - People who had early surgery might have stayed in the hospital longer.

2. **Laparoscopic Surgery for Appendix Abscess:**
   - 40 kids were split into early or delayed surgery groups.
   - No deaths were reported.
   - Not enough information was available to compare hospital stays or problems.
   - Kids who had early surgery seemed to feel better about their health 12 weeks afterward.

**Conclusion:**
We don’t have enough strong evidence to say if early or later surgery is better for people with an appendix lump or abscess. The findings were uncertain and need more research. Future studies should consider how antibiotics are used and other treatments before surgery, and should also look at how quickly people can return to their normal lives and how they feel overall.

**What's Next:**
More studies need to be done to find out the best time for appendix surgery and how to help people recover better."
"Background
Heart failure (HF) is a chronic disease with significant impact on quality of life and presents many challenges to those diagnosed with the condition, due to a seemingly complex daily regimen of self‐care which includes medications, monitoring of weight and symptoms, identification of signs of deterioration and follow‐up and interaction with multiple healthcare services. Education is vital for understanding the importance of this regimen, and adhering to it. Traditionally, education has been provided to people with heart failure in a face‐to‐face manner, either in a community or a hospital setting, using paper‐based materials or video/DVD presentations. In an age of rapidly‐evolving technology and uptake of smartphones and tablet devices, mHealth‐based technology (defined by the World Health Organization as mobile and wireless technologies to achieve health objectives) is an innovative way to provide health education which has the benefit of being able to reach people who are unable or unwilling to access traditional heart failure education programmes and services. 
Objectives
To systematically review and quantify the potential benefits and harms of mHealth‐delivered education for people with heart failure. 
Search methods
We performed an extensive search of bibliographic databases and registries (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal), using terms to identify HF, education and mHealth. We searched all databases from their inception to October 2019 and imposed no restriction on language of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included studies if they were conducted as a randomised controlled trial (RCT), involving adults (≥ 18 years) with a diagnosis of HF. We included trials comparing mHealth‐delivered education such as internet and web‐based education programmes for use on smartphones and tablets (including apps) and other mobile devices, SMS messages and social media‐delivered education programmes, versus usual HF care. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risks of bias, and extracted data from all included studies. We calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and the odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We assessed heterogeneity using the I2 statistic and assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria. 
Main results
We include five RCTs (971 participants) of mHealth‐delivered education interventions for people with HF in this review. The number of trial participants ranged from 28 to 512 participants. Mean age of participants ranged from 60 years to 75 years, and 63% of participants across the studies were men. Studies originated from Australia, China, Iran, Sweden, and The Netherlands. Most studies included participants with symptomatic HF, NYHA Class II ‐ III. 
Three studies addressed HF knowledge, revealing that the use of mHealth‐delivered education programmes showed no evidence of a difference in HF knowledge compared to usual care (MD 0.10, 95% CI −0.2 to 0.40, P = 0.51, I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 411 participants; low‐quality evidence). One study assessing self‐efficacy reported that both study groups had high levels of self‐efficacy at baseline and uncertainty in the evidence for the intervention (MD 0.60, 95% CI −0.57 to 1.77; P = 0.31; 1 study, 29 participants; very low‐quality evidence).Three studies evaluated HF self‐care using different scales. We did not pool the studies due to the heterogenous nature of the outcome measures, and the evidence is uncertain. None of the studies reported adverse events. Four studies examined health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). There was uncertainty in the evidence for the use of mHealth‐delivered education on HRQoL (MD −0.10, 95% CI −2.35 to 2.15; P = 0.93, I2 = 61%; 4 studies, 942 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Three studies reported on HF‐related hospitalisation. The use of mHealth‐delivered education may result in little to no difference in HF‐related hospitalisation (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.06; P = 0.10, I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 894 participants; low‐quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of the studies due to limitations in study design and execution, heterogeneity, wide confidence intervals and fewer than 500 participants in the analysis. 
Authors' conclusions
We found that the use of mHealth‐delivered educational interventions for people with HF shows no evidence of a difference in HF knowledge; uncertainty in the evidence for self‐efficacy, self‐care and health‐related quality of life; and may result in little to no difference in HF‐related hospitalisations. The identification of studies currently underway and those awaiting classification indicate that this is an area of research from which further evidence will emerge in the short and longer term.","mHealth‐delivered education interventions in heart failure, using smartphone, tablet and internet‐based programmes and apps 
Review question 
What is the randomised controlled trial evidence for mHealth‐delivered education interventions in heart failure (HF) knowledge, self‐care and self‐efficacy for people with HF when compared to traditional methods of patient education? 
Background 
Education is vital for self‐care (activities individuals undertake with the intention of improving health, preventing disease, limiting illness and restoring health) in HF. Traditionally, education has been provided to people with heart failure in a face‐to‐face manner, using paper‐based materials or video/DVD presentations. In an age of rapidly‐evolving technology and uptake of smartphones and tablet devices, mHealth‐based technology is a new way to provide health education, with the benefit of being able to reach people who are unable or unwilling to access traditional HF education programmes and services. 
Search date 
We found studies by searches conducted in October 2019.
Study characteristics 
We include in this review five randomised controlled trials (971 participants) of mHealth‐delivered education interventions for people with HF. The average age of participants ranged from 60 years to 75 years and 63% of participants were men. Studies came from Australia, China, Iran, Sweden and The Netherlands. 
Key results 
Five studies addressed HF knowledge; we found that the use of mHealth‐delivered education programmes showed no evidence of a difference in HF knowledge compared to usual care. One study assessing self‐efficacy reported uncertainty in the evidence for mHealth‐delivered education compared with usual care. Three studies evaluated HF self‐care using different scales. We did not combine the studies, because of the differences between the outcome measures, and the evidence is uncertain. The studies did not report any side effects of the interventions. Four studies examined health‐related quality of life and showed uncertainty in the evidence between mHealth‐delivered education and usual care. Three studies reported on HF‐related hospitalisation rates. The use of mHealth‐delivered education may result in little to no difference in HF‐related hospitalisations. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the evidence as very low to low, due to limitations in study design and execution and fewer than 500 participants in the analysis. 
Conclusion 
There is no evidence for a difference in the use of mHealth‐delivered educational intervention for people with HF on HF knowledge. There is uncertainty in the evidence for self‐efficacy, self‐care and health‐related quality of life. There may be little to no difference in HF‐related hospitalisations, compared to usual care. 'Usual care' in this case means enrolment in a heart failure‐management programme (clinic‐ or home‐based). This is an area of HF research from which further evidence will emerge in the short and longer term.","# Plain Language Summary: Mobile Health Education for Heart Failure

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether using smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices to teach people about heart failure is helpful. Researchers wanted to know if mobile health education works as well as traditional in-person classes.

## Why does this matter?

Heart failure is a long-term condition that requires people to take medications, watch their weight, recognize warning signs, and see doctors regularly. Education helps people understand and follow these steps. Mobile technology like apps and text messages could help people who can't attend regular classes.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for studies that tested mobile health education programs. They looked for studies that compared mobile education (apps, websites, text messages, or social media) to regular heart failure care. They found 5 studies with 971 total participants, mostly men around 60–75 years old, from Australia, China, Iran, Sweden, and the Netherlands.

## What did they find?

- **Heart failure knowledge:** Mobile education did not help people learn more about heart failure compared to regular care.
- **Confidence in managing their condition:** Results were unclear.
- **Self-care skills:** Results were unclear.
- **Quality of life:** Results were unclear.
- **Hospital stays:** Mobile education may make little to no difference in how often people go to the hospital.
- **Safety:** No harmful side effects were reported.

## Bottom line

The research shows that mobile health education for heart failure may not be better than regular care—but it also may not be worse. More studies are needed to know for sure.","### Summary of the Clinical Trial

#### Purpose
This study looked at using mobile technology to teach people about taking care of their hearts when they have heart problems. It aimed to find out if using smartphones and tablets for education helps compared to regular face-to-face teaching.

#### Who Participated
The study included five different trials with a total of 971 adults aged 60 to 75. Most participants were men, and the studies were conducted in Australia, China, Iran, Sweden, and The Netherlands.

#### What Happened
- The participants used mobile tools like apps, websites, and text messages to learn about heart care.
- Researchers compared this with traditional teaching methods.

#### What They Found
- **Heart Knowledge:** There was no clear difference in what people knew about heart care between those using mobile devices and those with regular care.
- **Confidence in Self-Care:** Both groups felt confident in managing their care, but it was unclear if mobile learning made a difference.
- **Heart Self-Care:** The results were mixed, so they couldn’t determine a clear outcome.
- **Quality of Life:** It was uncertain whether mobile learning improved life quality related to health.
- **Hospital Visits:** Mobile learning didn't seem to change the number of hospital visits due to heart issues.

#### Safety
No harmful effects were reported from using mobile learning tools.

#### Conclusion
Using mobile devices for heart education might not make a big difference compared to usual methods. More research is expected to provide better answers in the future."
"Background
Tinnitus affects 10% to 15% of the adult population, with about 20% of these experiencing symptoms that negatively affect quality of life. In England alone there are an estimated ¾ million general practice consultations every year where the primary complaint is tinnitus, equating to a major burden on healthcare services. Clinical management strategies include education and advice, relaxation therapy, tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), sound enrichment using ear‐level sound generators or hearing aids, and drug therapies to manage co‐morbid symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety or depression. Hearing aids, sound generators and combination devices (amplification and sound generation within one device) are a component of many tinnitus management programmes and together with information and advice are a first line of management in audiology departments for someone who has tinnitus. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of sound therapy (using amplification devices and/or sound generators) for tinnitus in adults. 
Search methods
The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 July 2018. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting adults with acute or chronic subjective idiopathic tinnitus. We included studies where the intervention involved hearing aids, sound generators or combination hearing aids and compared them to waiting list control, placebo or education/information only with no device. We also included studies comparing hearing aids to sound generators, combination hearing aids to hearing aids, and combination hearing aids to sound generators. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were tinnitus symptom severity as measured as a global score on multi‐item tinnitus questionnaire and significant adverse effects as indicated by an increase in self‐reported tinnitus loudness. Our secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms, symptoms of generalised anxiety, health‐related quality of life and adverse effects associated with wearing the device such as pain, discomfort, tenderness or skin irritation, or ear infections. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics. 
Main results
This review included eight studies (with a total of 590 participants). Seven studies investigated the effects of hearing aids, four combination hearing aids and three sound generators. Seven studies were parallel‐group RCTs and one had a cross‐over design. In general, risk of bias was unclear due to lack of detail about sequence generation and allocation concealment. There was also little or no use of blinding. 
No data for our outcomes were available for any of our three main comparisons (comparing hearing aids, sound generators and combination devices with a waiting list control group, placebo or education/information only). Data for our additional comparisons (comparing these devices with each other) were also few, with limited potential for data pooling. 
Hearing aid only versus sound generator device only  
One study compared patients fitted with sound generators versus those fitted with hearing aids and found no difference between them in their effects on our primary outcome, tinnitus symptom severity measured with the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) at 3, 6 or 12 months (low‐quality evidence). The use of both types of device was associated with a clinically significant reduction in tinnitus symptom severity. 
Combination hearing aid versus hearing aid only  
Three studies compared combination hearing aids with hearing aids and measured tinnitus symptom severity using the THI or Tinnitus Functional Index. When we pooled the data we found no difference between them (standardised mean difference ‐0.15, 95% confidence interval ‐0.52 to 0.22; three studies; 114 participants) (low‐quality evidence). The use of both types of device was again associated with a clinically significant reduction in tinnitus symptom severity. 
Adverse effects were not assessed in any of the included studies.
None of the studies measured the secondary outcomes of depressive symptoms or depression, anxiety symptoms or generalised anxiety, or health‐related quality of life as measured by a validated instrument, nor the newly developed core outcomes tinnitus intrusiveness, ability to ignore, concentration, quality of sleep and sense of control. 
Authors' conclusions
There is no evidence to support the superiority of sound therapy for tinnitus over waiting list control, placebo or education/information with no device. There is insufficient evidence to support the superiority or inferiority of any of the sound therapy options (hearing aid, sound generator or combination hearing aid) over each other. The quality of evidence for the reported outcomes, assessed using GRADE, was low. Using a combination device, hearing aid or sound generator might result in little or no difference in tinnitus symptom severity. 
Future research into the effectiveness of sound therapy in patients with tinnitus should use rigorous methodology. Randomisation and blinding should be of the highest quality, given the subjective nature of tinnitus and the strong likelihood of a placebo response. The CONSORT statement should be used in the design and reporting of future studies. We also recommend the use of validated, patient‐centred outcome measures for research in the field of tinnitus.","Sound therapy (using amplification devices or sound generators) for tinnitus
Review question 
Is sound therapy (using amplification devices, sound generators or both) effective for tinnitus in adults? 
Background 
Tinnitus is the awareness of a sound in the ear or head without any outside source. It affects 10% to 15% of the adult population. About 20% of people with tinnitus experience symptoms that negatively affect their quality of life including sleep disturbances, difficulties with hearing and concentration, social isolation, anxiety, depression, irritation or stress. Tinnitus can be managed through education and advice, relaxation therapy, psychological therapy, or devices that improve hearing or generate sound such as sound generators or hearing aids. Sometimes drugs are prescribed to manage problems associated with tinnitus such as sleep problems, anxiety or depression. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the evidence from high‐quality clinical trials to work out the effects of sound therapy (hearing aids, sound generators and combination hearing aids) on adults with tinnitus. We particularly wanted to look at the effects of sound therapy on tinnitus severity and any side effects. 
Study characteristics 
Our review identified eight randomised controlled trials with 590 participants in total. Seven studies looked at the effects of hearing aids, four combination hearing aids and three sound generators. Seven studies allocated participants into parallel groups and in one study participants tried each intervention in a random order. The outcomes that we looked for were severity of tinnitus symptoms, depression, anxiety, quality of life and side effects. In general, the risk of bias in the studies was unclear. There was also little or no use of blinding. 
Key results 
We did not find any data for our outcomes for any of our three main comparisons (comparing hearing aids, sound generators and combination devices with a waiting list control group, placebo or education/information only). There were also few data for our additional comparisons (comparing these devices with each other) and it was difficult to pool (combine) the data. 
Hearing aid only versus sound generator device only  
One study compared patients fitted with sound generators with those fitted with hearing aids and found no difference between them in their effects on our primary outcome, tinnitus symptom severity, at 3, 6 or 12 months. The use of both types of device was associated with a clinically significant reduction in tinnitus symptom severity. 
Combination hearing aid versus hearing aid only  
Three studies compared combination hearing aids/sound generators with hearing aids alone and measured tinnitus symptom severity. When we combined the data for tinnitus symptom severity we found no difference between them. The use of both types of device was again associated with a clinically significant reduction in tinnitus symptom severity. 
Adverse effects were not assessed in any of the included studies.
None of the studies measured depressive symptoms or depression, anxiety symptoms or generalised anxiety, or other important outcomes of interest in this review. 
Quality of evidence 
Where outcomes that we were interested in for this review were reported, we assessed the quality of the evidence available as low. Using a hearing aid, sound generator or combination device might result in little or no difference in tinnitus symptom severity.","# Plain Language Summary: Sound Therapy for Tinnitus

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether sound therapy devices help people with tinnitus (ringing in the ears). Researchers searched for studies that tested hearing aids, sound generators (devices that make sounds), or combination devices (hearing aids that also make sounds).

## Why is this important?

Tinnitus affects millions of people and can make daily life difficult. Doctors often recommend sound therapy devices as a first treatment option. However, researchers wanted to know if these devices actually work better than doing nothing or getting information only.

## What did researchers find?

The review included 8 studies with 590 people total. Here's what they discovered:

- **No clear winner:** There wasn't enough evidence to show that sound therapy devices work better than waiting without treatment or getting information only.

- **Devices compared to each other:** When researchers compared different types of devices to each other, they found little difference between them. Hearing aids worked about the same as sound generators. Combination devices worked about the same as regular hearing aids.

- **Symptom improvement:** When people used any of these devices, their tinnitus symptoms got better. However, researchers couldn't tell if this was because of the device or because people expected it to work.

- **Safety information:** The studies didn't report on side effects or safety problems.

## What does this mean?

The evidence is weak, so we can't say for certain which device works best. More research is needed using better study methods to find real answers about sound therapy for tinnitus.","### Plain Language Summary

**About the Study:**
Tinnitus is a condition where people hear ringing or buzzing in their ears, affecting 10% to 15% of adults. In England, many doctor visits are due to tinnitus, which can greatly impact people's lives. This study looked at using sound therapy—such as hearing aids and sound generators—to help adults with tinnitus.

**What Was the Study Trying to Find Out?**
The study aimed to see if sound therapy helps reduce the severity of tinnitus symptoms. Researchers compared different devices (hearing aids, sound generators, and combination devices) to each other and to a group that didn’t use any device.

**Who Was Involved?**
The study included eight smaller studies with a total of 590 adult participants.

**What Methods Were Used?**
- The researchers looked at various studies to find outcomes related to tinnitus severity.
- They also checked if there were any negative effects from using the devices.

**What Did They Find?**
- Both hearing aids and sound generators seemed to help reduce tinnitus symptoms, but there was no clear winner between them.
- Using a combination device didn’t show any extra benefit over just a hearing aid.
- There wasn’t enough evidence to say one device is better than another or better than not using a device.

**Safety and Other Outcomes:**
The studies didn't report on side effects of the devices or other health impacts like depression or anxiety.

**Conclusions and Future Directions:**
- No device proved to be better than waiting or just getting information.
- The quality of evidence was low, meaning more research is needed to be certain.
- Future studies should improve in design and measure more outcomes that matter to patients.

This summary tells you what the study looked at, what it found, and why it matters for people with tinnitus."
"Background
Urinary schistosomiasis is caused by an intravascular infection with parasitic Schistosoma haematobium worms. The adult worms typically migrate to the venous plexus of the human bladder and excrete eggs which the infected person passes in their urine. Chronic infection can cause substantial morbidity and long‐term complications as the eggs become trapped in human tissues causing inflammation and fibrosis. We summarised evidence of drugs active against the infection. This is new edition of a review first published in 1997. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of drugs for treating urinary schistosomiasis.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE and LILACS and reference lists of articles up to 23 May 2014. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antischistosomal drugs and drug combinations compared to placebo, no intervention, or each other. 
Data collection and analysis
Two researchers independently screened the records, extracted the data and assessed risk of bias. The primary efficacy outcomes were parasitological failure (defined as the continued presence of S. haematobium eggs in the urine at time points greater than one month after treatment), and percent reduction of egg counts from baseline. We presented dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR), and continuous data as mean difference (MD), alongside their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate we combined trials in meta analyses or tables. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 30 RCTs enrolling 8165 participants in this review. Twenty‐four trials were conducted in children in sub‐Saharan Africa, and 21 trials were over 20 years old. Many studies were assessed as being at unclear risk of bias due to inadequate descriptions of study methods. 
Praziquantel 
On average, a single 40 mg/kg dose of praziquantel reduced the proportion of people still excreting eggs in their urine by around 60% compared to placebo at one to two months after treatment (treatment failure: RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.59, 864 participants, seven trials, high quality evidence). The proportion of people cured with praziquantel varied substantially between trials, from 22.5% to 83.3%, but was higher than 60% in five of the seven trials. At one to two months following praziquantel treatment at 40 mg/kg, the mean number of schistosome eggs in the urine was reduced by over 95% in five out of six trials (678 participants, six trials, high quality evidence). 
Splitting praziquantel 40 mg/kg into two doses over 12 hours probably has no benefits over a single dose, and in a single trial of 220 participants the split dose caused more vomiting (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.86) and dizziness (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.94). 
Metrifonate 
A single dose of metrifonate 10 mg/kg reduced egg excretion (210 participants, one trial, at eight months), but was only marginally better than placebo at achieving cure at one month (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.94, 142 participants, one trial). In a single trial comparing one, two and three doses, the absolute number of participants cured improved from 47% after one dose to 81% after three doses (93 participants, one trial, low quality evidence). 
Two small trials compared 40 mg/kg single dose praziquantel with two or three doses of 10 mg/kg metrifonate and found no clear evidence of differences in cure (metrifonate 2 x 10 mg/kg at one month: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.34, 72 participants, one trial; metrifonate 3 x 10 mg/kg at three months: RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.57, 100 participants, one trial. In one trial both drugs performed badly and in one trial both performed well. 
Other drugs 
Three trials have evaluated the antimalarial artesunate; with inconsistent results. Substantial antischistosomal effects were only seen in one of the three trials, which was at unclear risk of bias due to poor reporting of the trial methods. Similarly, another anti‐malarial mefloquine has been evaluated in two small trials with inconsistent effects. 
Adverse events were described as mild for all evaluated drugs, but adverse event monitoring and reporting was generally of low quality. 
Authors' conclusions
Praziquantel 40 mg/kg is the most studied drug for treating urinary schistosomiasis, and has the strongest evidence base. 
Potential strategies to improve future treatments for schistosomiasis include the combination of praziquantel with metrifonate, or with antimalarial drugs with antischistosomal properties such as artesunate and mefloquine. Evaluation of these combinations requires rigorous, adequately powered trials using standardized outcome measures.","Drugs for treating urinary schistosomiasis
What is urinary schistosomiasis and how is it treated? 
Urinary schistosomiasis is a disease caused by infection of people with the parasitic worm Schistosoma haematobium. These worms live in blood vessels around the infected person's bladder and the worm releases eggs which are released in the person's urine. If the urine is passed into ponds or lakes, the eggs can hatch and infect people that are washing or swimming there. Infection can cause blood in the urine and if left untreated can eventually lead to anaemia, malnutrition, kidney failure, or bladder cancer. Urinary schistosomiasis is diagnosed by looking for worm eggs in the urine. 
The disease occurs mainly in school‐aged children and young adults in sub‐Saharan Africa. The drug currently recommended for treatment is praziquantel, which can be given as a single dose, but other drugs such as metrifonate, artesunate, and mefloquine have also been evaluated. 
After examining the research published up to 23th May 2014, we included 30 randomized controlled trials, enrolling 8165 children and adults. 
What does the research say? 
On average, the standard dose of praziquantel cures around 60% of people at one to two months after treatment (high quality evidence), and reduces the number of schistosome eggs in the urine by over 95% (high quality evidence). 
Metrifonate, an older drug no longer in use, had little effect when given as a single dose but an improved effect when given as multiple doses two weeks apart. Two trials compared three doses of metrifonate with the single dose of praziquantel and found similar effects. 
Two more recent trials evaluated a combination of artesunate and praziquantel compared to praziquantel alone. In one trial artesunate improved cure and in one it made no difference. 
Authors conclusions 
Future treatments for schistosomiasis could include combining praziquantel with metrifonate, or with artesunate, but these need to be evaluated in high quality trials.","# Plain Language Summary: Treating Urinary Schistosomiasis

## What is this study about?

This review looked at medicines used to treat urinary schistosomiasis, a disease caused by parasitic worms that live in the bladder and urinary system. When people have this infection for a long time, it can cause serious health problems.

## Who was studied?

The review included 30 research studies with a total of 8,165 people. Most studies were done with children in Africa, and many studies were conducted over 20 years ago.

## What treatments were tested?

**Praziquantel (the main drug tested):**
- A single dose of 40 mg/kg (measured by body weight) was the most commonly studied treatment
- About 60% of people stopped passing worm eggs in their urine after one to two months
- The number of worm eggs in urine dropped by over 95% in most people
- Splitting the dose into two smaller doses didn't work better and caused more side effects like vomiting and dizziness

**Metrifonate (another drug):**
- A single dose helped reduce worm eggs, but wasn't as effective as praziquantel
- Taking multiple doses worked better than one dose

**Other drugs tested:**
- Two antimalarial medicines (artesunate and mefloquine) were tried, but results were mixed and unclear

## What were the side effects?

All medicines caused only mild side effects. However, the studies didn't always report side effects clearly.

## Main findings

Praziquantel at 40 mg/kg is the best-studied and most effective medicine for this disease. Future research should test combinations of these medicines to see if they work even better.","### Plain Language Summary

**What is this study about?**

This study looks at different medicines to treat a disease called urinary schistosomiasis. This disease is caused by tiny worms that live in the bladder. It can make people very sick over time.

**Goals of the study:**

The main goal is to see how well these medicines work and how safe they are.

**Who was in the study?**

The study included 30 trials with 8,165 people, mostly children in sub-Saharan Africa.

**What medicines were tested?**

1. **Praziquantel:** 
   - A single dose (40 mg/kg) worked well for most people. It reduced the worms in urine by over 95% in many cases. 
   - Splitting the dose did not improve results and caused more side effects like vomiting and dizziness.

2. **Metrifonate:**
   - One dose helped, but three doses cured more people.
   - Compared with praziquantel, results were mixed.

3. **Other drugs (like artesunate and mefloquine):**
   - These had mixed results and need more research.

**Safety:**

All drugs had mild side effects, but the way these were noted was not very thorough.

**Conclusions:**

Praziquantel is the best-tested medicine and shows the most promise. Future studies should look at combining it with other drugs to improve treatment. More careful and detailed research is needed to find the best solutions."
"Background
Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are common in children and can involve both upper and lower airways. Many children experience frequent ARTI episodes or recurrent respiratory tract infections (RRTIs) in early life, which creates challenges for paediatricians, primary care physicians, parents and carers of children. 
In China, Astragalus (Huang qi), alone or in combination with other herbs, is used by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners in the form of a water extract, to reduce the risk of ARTIs; it is believed to stimulate the immune system. Better understanding of the therapeutic mechanisms of Astragalus may provide insights into ARTI prevention, and consequently reduced antibiotic use. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of oral Astragalus for preventing frequent episodes of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children in community settings. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 12, 2015), MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to 31 December 2015), Embase (Elsevier) (1974 to 31 December 2015), AMED (Ovid) (1985 to 31 December 2015), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1979 to 31 December 2015) and Chinese Scientific Journals full text database (CQVIP) (1989 to 31 December 2015), China Biology Medicine disc (CBM 1976 to 31 December 2015) and Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform (WanFang) (1998 to 31 December 2015). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral Astragalus as a sole Chinese herbal preparation with placebo to prevent frequent episodes of ARTIs in children. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures for this review. We assessed search results to identify relevant studies. We planned to extract data using standardised forms. Disagreements were to be resolved through discussion. Risk of bias was to be assessed using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We planned to use mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and risk ratio (RR) or odds ratio (OR) to analyse dichotomous data, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
Main results
We identified 6080 records: 3352 from English language databases, 2724 from Chinese databases, and four from other sources. Following initial screening and deduplication, we obtained 120 full‐text papers for assessment. Of these, 21 were not RCTs; 55 did not meet the inclusion criteria because: participants were aged over 14 years; definition was not included for recurrent or frequent episodes;Astragalus preparation was not an intervention; Astragalus preparation was in the formula but was not the sole agent; the Astragalus preparation was not administered orally; or Astragalus was used for treatment rather than prevention of ARTI. A further 44 studies were excluded because they were not placebo‐controlled, although other inclusion criteria were fulfilled. 
No RCTs met our inclusion criteria.
Authors' conclusions
We found insufficient evidence to enable assessment of the effectiveness and safety of oral Astragalus as a sole intervention to prevent frequent ARTIs in children aged up to 14 years.","Can oral Astragalus (Huang qi) prevent frequent acute respiratory tract infections in children? 
Review question 
We assessed evidence for the benefits and harms of oral Astragalus used alone to prevent frequent episodes of acute respiratory infections (ARTIs) in children aged up to 14 years, compared to a dummy treatment. ARTIs include colds, sore throats, laryngitis, influenza, bronchitis and pneumonia. 
Background 
Many therapies are used to prevent ARTIs, especially in children. Astragalus, is a widely used and available herbal therapy that has been used for thousands of years in China to help prevent ARTIs. It is thought to boost immunity. Almost one in five children experience frequent ARTIs and treatment accounts for up to 75% of all prescribed antibiotics for children. Because most ARTIs are caused by viruses, antibiotics are not effective in treating these illnesses. 
Search date 
We searched the literature up to 31 December 2015.
Study characteristics 
We identified 6080 potentially relevant records. After removing duplicate records, and those that did not meet our inclusion criteria, we obtained 120 full‐text studies. We carefully assessed these studies for possible inclusion. We excluded most studies because: they presented unclear diagnosis criteria; Astragalus preparation was used with other agents; or Astragalus was not compared with a dummy treatment. No studies met our inclusion criteria and so we were unable to analyse any results. 
Study funding sources 
We could not assess study funding sources.
Key results 
We did not find any studies that compared use of oral Astragalus alone with a dummy treatment to prevent frequent episodes of ARTI in children aged up to 14 years. Well‐designed, conducted and reported studies investigating this issue are needed to enable assessment in the future. 
Quality of the evidence 
We could not assess evidence quality.","# Plain Language Summary: Astragalus for Preventing Respiratory Infections in Children

## What is this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if a plant called Astragalus (also called Huang qi) can help prevent kids from getting frequent respiratory infections (infections in the lungs and airways). In China, some traditional medicine doctors use Astragalus to try to boost the immune system and prevent these infections.

## Who would this study help?

This research would help children who get sick with respiratory infections a lot, as well as their parents, doctors, and caregivers who are looking for ways to prevent these illnesses.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for high-quality studies that tested whether Astragalus works. They looked through medical databases in English and Chinese from 1946 to 2015. They were looking for studies that:
- Tested Astragalus as the only treatment (not mixed with other herbs)
- Compared it to a placebo (fake treatment)
- Included children up to age 14
- Were designed to prevent infections (not treat them)

## What did they find?

Researchers found 6,080 studies to review. After carefully checking each one, **they found zero studies that met all their requirements**. Many studies didn't use the right study design, tested the wrong age group, or mixed Astragalus with other herbs.

## Conclusion

There is not enough good evidence right now to say whether Astragalus actually works to prevent respiratory infections in children.","### Plain Language Summary

**Background**
Many children often get colds or other breathing problems, which can be tough for doctors, parents, and caregivers. In China, a plant called Astragalus, used in Traditional Chinese Medicine, might help prevent these infections by boosting the immune system.

**Objective**
The goal of this study was to see if taking Astragalus by mouth is safe and effective in preventing frequent colds and respiratory infections in children.

**Method**
Researchers searched many medical databases for studies that compared Astragalus to a fake treatment (placebo) in children.

**Key Findings**
- They looked at over 6,000 reports, but only 120 were closely reviewed.
- Many studies didn't fit because:
  - The children were older than 14.
  - Astragalus wasn’t the only treatment used.
  - It wasn’t given by mouth.
  - It was used to treat, not prevent, infections.
- No study met all the necessary criteria for this research.

**Conclusion**
There isn’t enough evidence to know if Astragalus by itself is safe and effective for preventing frequent respiratory infections in children up to age 14. More research is needed."
"Background
Onychomycosis refers to fungal infections of the nail apparatus that may cause pain, discomfort, and disfigurement. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2007; a substantial amount of new research warrants a review exclusively on toenails. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical and mycological effects of topical drugs and device‐based therapies for toenail onychomycosis. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of topical and device‐based therapies for onychomycosis in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by positive cultures, direct microscopy, or histological nail examination. Eligible comparators were placebo, vehicle, no treatment, or an active topical or device‐based treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were complete cure rate (normal‐looking nail plus fungus elimination, determined with laboratory methods) and number of participants reporting treatment‐related adverse events. 
Main results
We included 56 studies (12,501 participants, average age: 27 to 68 years), with mainly mild‐to‐moderate onychomycosis without matrix involvement (where reported). Participants had more than one toenail affected. Most studies lasted 48 to 52 weeks; 23% reported disease duration (variable). Thirty‐five studies specifically examined dermatophyte‐caused onychomycosis. Forty‐three studies were carried out in outpatient settings. Most studies assessed topical treatments, 9% devices, and 11% both. 
We rated three studies at low risk of bias across all domains. The most common high‐risk domain was performance bias. We present results for key comparisons, where treatment duration was 36 or 48 weeks, and clinical outcomes were measured at 40 to 52 weeks. 
Based on two studies (460 participants), compared with vehicle, ciclopirox 8% lacquer may be more effective in achieving complete cure (risk ratio (RR) 9.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72 to 50.14; low‐quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 3.15, 95% CI 1.93 to 5.12; moderate‐quality evidence). Ciclopirox lacquer may lead to increased adverse events, commonly application reactions, rashes, and nail alteration (e.g. colour, shape). However, the 95% CI indicates that ciclopirox lacquer may actually make little or no difference (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.92; low‐quality evidence). 
Efinaconazole 10% solution is more effective than vehicle in achieving complete cure (RR 3.54, 95% CI 2.24 to 5.60; 3 studies, 1716 participants) and clinical cure (RR 3.07, 95% CI 2.08 to 4.53; 2 studies, 1655 participants) (both high‐quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.94; 3 studies, 1716 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Risk of adverse events (such as dermatitis and vesicles) was slightly higher with efinaconazole (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.20; 3 studies, 1701 participants; high‐quality evidence). No other key comparison measured clinical cure. 
Based on two studies, compared with vehicle, tavaborole 5% solution is probably more effective in achieving complete cure (RR 7.40, 95% CI 2.71 to 20.24; 1198 participants), but probably has a higher risk of adverse events (application site reactions were most commonly reported) (RR 3.82, 95% CI 1.65 to 8.85; 1186 participants (both moderate‐quality evidence)). Tavaborole improves mycological cure (RR 3.40, 95% CI 2.34 to 4.93; 1198 participants; high‐quality evidence). 
Moderate‐quality evidence from two studies (490 participants) indicates that P‐3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) is probably more effective than the comparators ciclopirox 8% lacquer or amorolfine 5% in achieving complete cure (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.32 to 4.48), but there is probably little or no difference between the treatments in achieving mycological cure (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.37). We found no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.92; 2 studies, 487 participants; low‐quality evidence). The most common events were erythema, rash, and burning. 
Three studies (112 participants) compared 1064‐nm Nd:YAG laser to no treatment or sham treatment. We are uncertain if there is a difference in adverse events (very low‐quality evidence) (two studies; 85 participants). There may be little or no difference in mycological cure at 52 weeks (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.85; 2 studies, 85 participants; low‐quality evidence). Complete cure was not measured. 
One study (293 participants) compared luliconazole 5% solution to vehicle. We are uncertain whether luliconazole leads to higher rates of complete cure (very low‐quality evidence). Low‐quality evidence indicates there may be little or no difference in adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.16) and there may be increased mycological cure with luliconazole; however, the 95% CI indicates that luliconazole may make little or no difference to mycological cure (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.97). Commonly‐reported adverse events were dry skin, paronychia, eczema, and hyperkeratosis, which improved or resolved post‐treatment. 
Authors' conclusions
Assessing complete cure, high‐quality evidence supports the effectiveness of efinaconazole, moderate‐quality evidence supports P‐3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) and tavaborole, and low‐quality evidence supports ciclopirox 8% lacquer. We are uncertain whether luliconazole 5% solution leads to complete cure (very low‐quality evidence); this outcome was not measured by the 1064‐nm Nd:YAG laser comparison. Although evidence supports topical treatments, complete cure rates with topical treatments are relatively low. 
We are uncertain if 1064‐nm Nd:YAG laser increases adverse events compared with no treatment or sham treatment (very low‐quality evidence). Low‐quality evidence indicates that there is no difference in adverse events between P‐3051 (ciclopirox hydrolacquer), luliconazole 5% solution, and their comparators. Ciclopirox 8% lacquer may increase adverse events (low‐quality evidence). High‐ to moderate‐quality evidence suggests increased adverse events with efinaconazole 10% solution or tavaborole 5% solution. 
We downgraded evidence for heterogeneity, lack of blinding, and small sample sizes. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of device‐based treatments, which were under‐represented; 80% of studies assessed topical treatments, but we were unable to evaluate all of the currently relevant topical treatments. 
Future studies of topical and device‐based therapies should be blinded, with patient‐centred outcomes and an adequate sample size. They should specify the causative organism and directly compare treatments.","Are topical and device‐based treatments effective in people with fungal infections of the toenails? 
Review question 
We reviewed evidence about the effect of topical and device‐based treatments for fungal infections of the toenails (toenail onychomycosis) when compared against each other, placebo (an identical but inactive treatment), vehicle (inactive ingredients that help deliver an active treatment), or no treatment. We assessed adults, whose infection was diagnosed based on studying nail samples. 
Background 
Toenail onychomycosis causes pain, discomfort, and disfigurement. Topical and device‐based treatments can have less likelihood of drug interactions or side effects than oral drugs. Antifungal medications are either fungistatic (inhibiting fungal growth) or fungicidal (killing fungal pathogens). The shared goal of devices (e.g. laser, photodynamic therapy) is fungus destruction. 
Study characteristics 
In searches up to May 2019, we found 56 studies including 12,501 men or women (average age: 27 to 68 years) who had mainly mild‐to‐moderate toenail onychomycosis. Onychomycosis duration was under‐reported, but varied from months to years. Approximately 63% of the studies assessed onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes (fungi). Most studies lasted 48 to 52 weeks and were conducted in an outpatient setting. The studies used either device‐based or topical treatments, including lacquers and creams, alone or in combination, compared to each other, to no treatment, to vehicle, or to placebo. 
Key results 
For the following key results, treatment lasted 36 or 48 weeks, and outcomes were measured at 40 to 52 weeks (side effects were measured throughout the study). 
Compared to vehicle (no treatment), efinaconazole 10% topical solution is better at achieving complete cure (i.e. normal‐looking nail coupled with fungus elimination determined using laboratory methods) (high‐quality evidence). Tavaborole 5% solution (when compared to vehicle) and P‐3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) (when compared to two other treatments: ciclopirox 8% lacquer or amorolfine 5%) are probably better at achieving this outcome (both moderate‐quality evidence). Ciclopirox 8% lacquer may lead to higher complete cure rates than vehicle, but rates are low (not all patients can be expected to achieve complete cure) (low‐quality evidence). 
Ciclopirox 8% lacquer and efinaconazole 10% are probably more effective at eliminating the fungus (mycological cure) than vehicle, but for P‐3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) there is probably little or no difference compared to the two comparator treatments (all moderate‐quality evidence). Tavaborole 5% improves mycological cure compared to vehicle (high‐quality evidence). 
We found no evidence of a difference in side effects, including redness, rash, and burning, between P‐3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) and the two other treatments (low‐quality evidence), and ciclopirox 8% lacquer may increase side effects, including application‐site reactions, rashes, and changes in the nail compared with vehicle, although treatment effects vary, so it is possible that it may actually make little or no difference (low‐quality evidence). Compared to vehicle, participants were slightly more likely to experience side effects (commonly dermatitis and fluid‐filled sacs) with efinaconazole 10% (high‐quality evidence) and probably more likely to experience side effects with tavaborole 5% (commonly, application‐site reactions, such as dermatitis, redness, and pain) (moderate‐quality evidence). 
We are uncertain of the effect of luliconazole 5% on complete cure when compared to vehicle (very low‐quality evidence); there may be little or no difference between these groups in side effects (dry skin, eczema, and thickening of the skin were commonly reported, but improved after stopping treatment), and luliconazole 5% solution might increase mycological cure; however, the effects of this treatment vary, so it is possible that it may actually make little or no difference to mycological cure (both low‐quality evidence). 
Three studies compared laser to no treatment or sham treatment, and there may be little or no difference in mycological cure (low‐quality evidence). Complete cure was not measured, and we are uncertain if there is a difference in side effects between groups (very low‐quality evidence). 
Efinaconazole 10% solution is more effective in achieving clinical cure than vehicle (high‐quality evidence); none of the other key comparisons measured this outcome. 
Quality of the evidence 
We base our conclusions on varied evidence quality. For complete cure, mycological cure, and side effects, quality ranged from low to high, with very low‐quality evidence found for three key results. 
Many studies were small, had design issues, and did not directly compare therapies. No studies reported quality of life.","# Plain Language Summary: Treatments for Toenail Fungus

## What is this study about?

Researchers reviewed 56 studies to compare different treatments for toenail fungus infections. Toenail fungus can cause pain, discomfort, and make nails look bad.

## Who was in the studies?

The studies included 12,501 people, mostly between ages 27 and 68. Most had mild to moderate fungus infections affecting more than one toenail.

## What treatments were tested?

**Topical treatments (applied to the nail):**
- Ciclopirox 8% lacquer (nail polish-like treatment)
- Efinaconazole 10% solution
- Tavaborole 5% solution
- P-3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer)
- Luliconazole 5% solution

**Device-based treatment:**
- 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser

These were compared to placebo (fake treatment) or no treatment.

## How long did the studies last?

Most studies lasted 48 to 52 weeks (about 1 year).

## What were the main findings?

**Most effective treatments:**
- **Efinaconazole** worked best—it had the strongest evidence showing it cured toenail fungus better than placebo
- **Tavaborole** and **P-3051** probably worked well too
- **Ciclopirox lacquer** may have helped, but evidence was weaker

**Important note:** Even the best treatments only cured the fungus completely in a small number of people.

**Side effects:**
- Efinaconazole and tavaborole caused slightly more side effects (skin irritation, rashes)
- Ciclopirox lacquer may cause application reactions and nail color changes
- The laser treatment had unclear side effects

## What did researchers conclude?

Topical treatments work better than doing nothing, but complete cure rates are still relatively low. More research is needed on laser treatments. Future studies should be better designed and compare treatments directly.","### Toenail Fungus Treatment Study: Easy-to-Understand Summary

**What is Toenail Fungus?**
Toenail fungus is an infection that affects toenails, causing pain and changes in nail appearance. 

**Purpose of the Study**
The study looked at how well different creams and devices work to treat toenail fungus.

**How Did They Look for Information?**
Researchers searched medical databases and looked at past studies to find relevant trials about toenail fungus up to May 2019.

**Who Was Involved?**
12,501 people with toenail fungus, aged between 27 and 68, took part in 56 studies. Most had mild to moderate infections.

**Treatments Tested**
The study reviewed both topical treatments (creams applied to the nail) and device-based therapies.

1. **Ciclopirox 8% Lacquer**
   - May help cure the infection (low-quality evidence).
   - May cause side effects like rashes or nail changes.

2. **Efinaconazole 10% Solution**
   - Shown to be effective in curing the infection (high-quality evidence).
   - Slightly higher chance of side effects like skin irritation.

3. **Tavaborole 5% Solution**
   - Likely effective in curing the infection (moderate-quality evidence).
   - Risk of side effects such as reactions where applied.

4. **P‐3051 (Ciclopirox 8% Hydrolacquer)**
   - Could be more effective than other lacquers (moderate-quality evidence).
   - Similar side effects as other treatments.

5. **Luliconazole 5% Solution**
   - Uncertain if it really helps (very low-quality evidence).
   - Side effects like dry skin were reported.

6. **1064-nm Nd:YAG Laser**
   - Not clear if it’s effective or if it increases side effects (very low-quality evidence).

**What Did the Study Find?**
- **Topical Treatments:** These seem to work but not for everyone. Complete cures are not very common.
- **Device-Based Treatments:** Not enough evidence to say whether they work well.

**Safety Notes**
Some treatments can cause side effects, like skin reactions or nail changes. It’s important to consider these when choosing a treatment.

**What’s Next?**
Researchers suggest future studies should focus on patient-centered outcomes and include larger groups of people. They should also compare different treatments directly.

This summary helps to give an idea about what options are available for treating toenail fungus and how effective they might be. Always talk to a healthcare professional for advice specific to your situation."
"Background
The frequency of skin ulceration makes an important contributor to the morbidity burden in people with sickle cell disease. Many treatment options are available to the healthcare professional, although it is uncertain which treatments have been assessed for effectiveness in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical effectiveness and harms of interventions for treating leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. 
We searched LILACS (1982 to January 2020), ISI Web of Knowledge (1985 to January 2020), and the Clinical Trials Search Portal of the World Health Organization (January 2020). We checked the reference lists of all the trials identified. We also contacted those groups or individuals who may have completed relevant randomised trials in this area. 
Date of the last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 13 January 2020; date of the last search of the Cochrane Wounds Group Trials Register: 17 February 2017. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of interventions for treating leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease compared to placebo or an alternative treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion. All three authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
Six studies met the inclusion criteria (198 participants with 250 ulcers). Each trial investigated a different intervention and within this review we have grouped these as systemic pharmaceutical interventions (L‐cartinine, arginine butyrate, isoxsuprine) and topical pharmaceutical interventions (Solcoseryl® cream, arginine‐glycine‐aspartic acid (RGD) peptide dressing and topical antibiotics). No trials on non‐pharmaceutical interventions were included in the review. All trials had an overall unclear or high risk of bias, and drug companies sponsored four of them. We were unable to pool findings due to the heterogeneity in outcome definitions, and inconsistency between the units of randomisation and analysis. 
Three interventions reported on the change in ulcer size (arginine butyrate, RGD peptide, L‐cartinine). Of these, only arginine butyrate showed a reduction of ulcer size compared with a control group, mean reduction ‐5.10 cm² (95% CI ‐9.65 to ‐0.55), but we are uncertain whether this reduces ulcer size compared to standard care alone as the certainty of the evidence has been assessed as very low. Three trials reported on complete leg ulcer closure (isoxsuprine, arginine butyrate, RGD peptide matrix; very low quality of evidence). None reported a clinical benefit. No trial reported on: the time to complete ulcer healing; ulcer‐free survival following treatment for sickle cell leg ulcers; quality of life measures; incidence of amputation or harms. 
Authors' conclusions
Given the very low quality of the evidence identified in this updated Cochrane Review we are uncertain whether any of the assessed pharmaceutical interventions reduce ulcer size or result in leg ulcer closure in treated participants compared to controls. However, this intervention was assessed as having a high risk of bias due to inadequacies in the single trial report. Other included studies were also assessed as having an unclear or high risk of bias. The harm profile of the all interventions remains inconclusive.","Treatments for leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness and harms of interventions for treating leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. 
Background 
Leg ulcers are a chronic complication for people living with sickle cell disease. Ulcers tend to be difficult to treat successfully, healing slowly over months or years. They can severely disrupt quality of life, increase disability, require extended absence from the workplace, and place a high burden of care on healthcare systems. We looked at whether treatments for leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease were effective and safe. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 13 January 2020.
Study characteristics 
In this updated Cochrane Review we have included six randomised controlled trials including 198 participants with 250 ulcers. Four of the randomised controlled trials were conducted in Jamaica and two in the USA. These trials included medications or dressings applied directly to the ulcer (topical medications) and medications given orally or intravenously (systemic medications). Given the very different modes of action of these two groups, we treated them separately throughout the review. The topical agents included Solcoseryl® cream, RGD peptide matrix dressing and topical antibiotics. Socoseryl aims to improve the use of oxygen by the skin tissue and so promote wound healing. Topical antibiotics are also used to prevent infection. The RGD peptide matrix is a gel that promotes cell growth. The systemic interventions included arginine butyrate, L‐cartinine, and isoxsuprine. Aginine butyrate, given intravenously, is thought to accelerate wound healing, L‐carnitine, given orally, is thought to improve tissue hypoxia, and isoxsuprine, given orally as isoxsuprine hydrochloride, is thought to widen blood vessels, so increasing blood flow to an affected wound. 
Key results 
Given the very low quality of the evidence we are uncertain whether any of the assessed pharmaceutical interventions reduce ulcer size or result in leg ulcer closure. None of the included trials reported on our other outcomes of interest: the time to complete ulcer healing; ulcer‐free survival following treatment for sickle cell leg ulcers; quality of life measures; incidence of amputation; or harms. 
Quality of the evidence 
There is very limited evidence available on the use of interventions to treat people with sickle cell disease and chronic leg ulceration. All randomised clinical trials that we included in this review were associated with an unclear or high risk of bias, providing very low‐quality evidence. This systematic review has shown the need for well‐designed, high‐quality randomised trials to assess the benefits and harms of interventions to improve the healing of leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease.","# Plain Language Summary: Treatments for Leg Ulcers in People with Sickle Cell Disease

## What is this study about?

People with sickle cell disease often develop painful sores (ulcers) on their legs. This review looked at research studies testing different medicines and treatments to help these leg ulcers heal.

## Why is this important?

Leg ulcers are a common problem for people with sickle cell disease and cause a lot of pain and other health issues. Doctors have many treatment options, but we don't know which ones actually work best.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for all high-quality studies that tested treatments for leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease. They looked for studies that compared a new treatment to either a fake treatment (placebo) or a standard treatment. They found 6 studies with a total of 198 people who had 250 leg ulcers.

## What treatments were tested?

The treatments fell into two groups:

- **Medicines taken by mouth:** L-carnitine, arginine butyrate, and isoxsuprine
- **Creams or dressings applied to the skin:** Solcoseryl cream, RGD peptide dressing, and topical antibiotics

## What did they find?

The results were unclear. Only one medicine (arginine butyrate) showed that ulcers got slightly smaller compared to a control group. However, the researchers said they are not confident this actually works because the studies had problems with how they were done.

None of the treatments showed that leg ulcers completely closed or healed.

## What information is missing?

The studies did not report on:
- How long it took for ulcers to fully heal
- Whether people stayed ulcer-free after treatment
- How the treatments affected quality of life
- Whether any legs needed to be amputated
- What side effects occurred

## Bottom line

We don't have enough good evidence to say whether any of these treatments actually help leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease get better. More and better research is needed.","**Plain Language Summary:**

**Why This Study Was Done:**
People with sickle cell disease often get painful leg sores (ulcers). Doctors have many treatments to choose from, but it's unclear which ones really help heal these sores.

**Study Goal:**
The study aimed to find out how effective different treatments are for healing leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease and if they cause any harm.

**How They Searched for Information:**
Researchers looked through various medical databases and contacted experts to find studies that tested treatments on people with sickle cell disease leg ulcers.

**What They Found:**
The study looked at six different treatments tested on 198 people with 250 leg sores. These treatments included medicines taken by mouth and creams or dressings put on the sores. 

**Results:**
- Only one treatment, called arginine butyrate, showed some reduction in sore size, but the researchers are not sure if it works better than regular care.
- No clear proof was found that any treatment completely healed the sores.
- The quality of the results was very low, meaning researchers are not confident in the findings.

**Safety and Side Effects:**
The study did not find clear information about side effects or safety of these treatments.

**Conclusion:**
Due to low-quality evidence, it’s uncertain if these treatments really help with healing leg sores from sickle cell disease. More reliable studies are needed to determine the best way to treat these ulcers safely."
"Background
Injury to the abdomen can be blunt or penetrating. Abdominal injury can damage internal organs such as the liver, spleen, kidneys, intestine, and large blood vessels. There are controversies about the best approach to manage abdominal injuries. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of surgical and non‐surgical interventions in the management of abdominal trauma in a haemodynamically stable and non‐peritonitic abdomen. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, The Cochrane Library, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), EMBASE Classic+EMBASE (Ovid), ISI WOS (SCI‐EXPANDED, SSCI, CPCI‐S & CPSI‐SSH), CINAHL Plus (EBSCO), and clinical trials registers, and screened reference lists. We ran the most recent search on 17 September 2015. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of surgical interventions and non‐surgical interventions involving people with abdominal injury who were haemodynamically stable with no signs of peritonitis. The abdominal injury could be blunt or penetrating. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently applied the selection criteria. Data were extracted by two authors using a standard data extraction form, and are reported narratively. 
Main results
Two studies are included, which involved a total of 114 people with penetrating abdominal injuries. Both studies are at moderate risk of bias because the randomisation methods are not fully described, and the original study protocols are no longer available. The studies were undertaken in Finland between 1992 and 2002, by the same two researchers. 
In one study, 51 people were randomised to surgery or an observation protocol. None of the participants in the study died. Seven people had complications: 5 (18.5%) in the surgical group and 2 (8.3%) in the observation group; the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.42; Fischer's exact). Among the 27 people who had surgery, 6 (22.2%) surgeries were negative laparotomies, and 15 (55.6%) were non‐therapeutic. 
In the other study, 63 people were randomised to diagnostic laparoscopy (surgery) or an observation protocol. There were no deaths and no unnecessary surgeries in either group. Four people did not receive the intervention they were assigned. There was no difference in therapeutic operations between the two groups: 3 of 28 in the diagnostic laparoscopy group versus 1 of 31 in the observation protocol group (P = 0.337). 
Authors' conclusions
Based on the findings of 2 studies involving a total of 114 people, there is no evidence to support the use of surgery over an observation protocol for people with penetrating abdominal trauma who have no signs of peritonitis and are stable.","Surgery versus observation for people with abdominal injury
Injury to the abdomen is common and can be blunt from road traffic crashes or falls, or penetrating from gun shots or stabbing. These injuries are usually associated with injury to the abdominal organs such as the liver, spleen, kidneys, intestine and its covering, and big blood vessels. Massive bleeding or leakage of abdominal content into the abdominal cavity can occur, which may threaten a person's life. Examination of the patient by the doctor (physical examination), though the most accurate method of assessing people, is insufficient to determine the extent of damage. On the other hand, a person should not have a surgical procedure unless it is necessary. There are reports that injuries can be missed even when surgery is carried out. 
Observing a patient with the hope that the person's injury heals naturally and intervening surgically if the need arises is known as selective non‐operative management (SNOM) or observation. An observation protocol is used when the person has no sign of internal bleeding or abdominal infection (peritonitis). Surgery is resorted to if, during observation, signs of bleeding or infection are observed. 
The authors of this review sought to identify every study where people with an abdominal injury were randomised to surgery or observation. The authors searched a variety of medical databases but only identified 2 studies, involving 51 and 63 people respectively, both of which took place in Finland and were conducted by the same researchers. Both studies included people with penetrating abdominal injuries, from having been stabbed. The review authors considered both studies to be at moderate risk of bias, since only part of the randomisation process was described and the study protocols were not available to enable full assessment of overall quality. 
In one study (1992‐1994) people received either an observation protocol or mandatory surgery. None of the people in the study died, and there was no difference in the number of people with medical complications between the study groups. One of the harms mentioned by the study authors was that surgery was performed on some people who did not actually need it. Unnecessary surgery can subject people to potential complications. 
In the other study (1997‐2002) people received an observation protocol or diagnostic laparoscopy (minimal surgery). No one died in either group, and there were no differences between the groups in the number of surgeries needed. There were no unnecessary surgeries in either group. 
Based on the findings of these two small studies, there is no evidence to support the use of surgical management over an observation protocol for people with abdominal trauma showing no signs of bleeding or infection. 
The authors recommend that future randomised controlled studies clearly report the type of injury, number of damaged organs, extent of damage of internal organs, and complications in the people included.","# Plain Language Summary: Treatment of Abdominal Injuries

## What is this study about?

This review looked at the best way to treat people who have been stabbed or have deep cuts to the belly (abdomen). Specifically, it compared two approaches: surgery right away versus watching and waiting to see if surgery becomes necessary.

## Who was studied?

The review included 114 people total from two studies. All of these people had penetrating abdominal injuries (stab wounds or deep cuts). They were all stable enough that doctors thought they could safely be observed without immediate surgery.

## What were the two treatment approaches?

**Surgery group:** People had surgery right away to check for injuries inside the belly.

**Observation group:** People were watched closely by doctors. They only had surgery if their condition got worse or showed signs they needed it.

## What happened to the people in the study?

- **Deaths:** No one died in either group.
- **Complications:** A few people had problems (7 total), but there was no real difference between the surgery and observation groups.
- **Unnecessary surgeries:** In the surgery group, many operations found no injuries or injuries that didn't need fixing.
- **Need for surgery later:** Both groups needed about the same amount of surgery overall.

## What did researchers conclude?

For people with belly stab wounds who are stable and show no signs of serious infection, watching and waiting appears to work just as well as surgery right away. There is no clear evidence that surgery is better.","**Summary of Study on Abdominal Injuries**

**Background**
Sometimes, people get hurt in their belly area. This can be from things like accidents or cuts. When this happens, important body parts inside can be damaged. Doctors are trying to figure out the best way to help people with these injuries.

**Objective**
The main goal of this study was to see if surgery or just watching and waiting is better for people with certain types of belly injuries who are stable and not showing specific bad signs.

**Who Was Studied?**
The study looked at people who were stable after getting hurt in the belly. These injuries could come from blunt hits or cuts.

**What Did They Do?**
Researchers looked at two main ways to help: surgery or just carefully watching the patient (called an observation protocol).

**Findings**
- Two studies from Finland included 114 people with belly injuries. 
- In one study, 51 people were either given surgery or just watched. No one died, but some had problems like infections: 5 out of 27 in the surgery group and 2 out of 24 in the observation group. 
- In the second study, 63 people either had a small surgery to look inside or were just watched. Again, no deaths or extra surgeries were needed.

**Conclusion**
The studies showed that for people who are stable and don’t have specific bad signs after getting a belly injury, watching them carefully is just as effective as doing surgery."
"Background
People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of pneumococcal disease, especially pneumonia, as well as acute exacerbations with associated morbidity and healthcare costs. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy of injectable pneumococcal vaccination for preventing pneumonia in persons with COPD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways COPD Trials Register and the databases CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase, using prespecified terms. Searches are current to November 2016. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing injectable pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) or pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV) versus a control or alternative vaccine type in people with COPD. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. For meta‐analyses, we subgrouped studies by vaccine type. 
Main results
For this update, we added five studies (606 participants), meaning that the review now includes a total of 12 RCTs involving 2171 participants with COPD. Average age of participants was 66 years, male participants accounted for 67% and mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 1.2 L (five studies), 54% predicted (four studies). We assessed risks of selection, attrition and reporting bias as low, and risks of performance and detection bias as moderate. 
Compared with control, the vaccine group had a lower likelihood of developing community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP) (odds ratio (OR) 0.59 , 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.85; six studies, n = 1372; GRADE: moderate), but findings did not differ specifically for pneumococcal pneumonia (Peto OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.31; three studies, n = 1158; GRADE: low). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) (preventing one episode of CAP) was 19 (95% CI 13 to 52). Mortality from cardiorespiratory causes did not differ between vaccine and control groups (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.66; three studies, n = 888; GRADE: moderate), nor did all‐cause mortality differ (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.40; five studies, n = 1053; GRADE: moderate). The likelihood of hospital admission for any cause, or for cardiorespiratory causes, did not differ between vaccine and control groups. Vaccination significantly reduced the likelihood of a COPD exacerbation (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.93; four studies, n = 446; GRADE: moderate). The NNTB to prevent a patient from experiencing an acute exacerbation was 8 (95% CI 5 to 58). Only one study (n = 181) compared the efficacy of different vaccine types ‐ 23‐valent PPV versus 7‐valent PCV ‐ and reported no differences for CAP, all‐cause mortality, hospital admission or likelihood of a COPD exacerbation, but investigators described a greater likelihood of some mild adverse effects of vaccination with PPV‐23. 
Authors' conclusions
Injectable polyvalent pneumococcal vaccination provides significant protection against community‐acquired pneumonia, although no evidence indicates that vaccination reduced the risk of confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia, which was a relatively rare event. Vaccination reduced the likelihood of a COPD exacerbation, and moderate‐quality evidence suggests the benefits of pneumococcal vaccination in people with COPD. Evidence was insufficient for comparison of different pneumococcal vaccine types.","Do injectable pneumococcal vaccines prevent pneumonia in people with COPD?
We wanted to find out if pneumococcal vaccination for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) reduces the risk of pneumonia and associated mortality. We found a total of 12 studies including 2171 participants. Evidence gathered in this review is current to December 2015. 
Background 
People with COPD are at increased risk of respiratory illness such as pneumonia due to a bacterium called Streptococcus pneumoniae, other community‐acquired pneumonias and acute COPD exacerbations. These illnesses increase mortality and are associated with increased healthcare costs. 
Study characteristics 
For this updated review, we identified five new studies (606 participants), bringing the total number of studies to 12, involving 2171 participants with COPD. The average age of participants was 66 years, 67% were male and participants had received a diagnosis of moderate to severe COPD. Eleven studies compared an injectable vaccine versus a control, and one study compared two different types of injectable vaccine. 
Key results 
People who were vaccinated were less likely to experience an episode of community‐acquired pneumonia; 19 people with COPD (95% confidence interval (CI) 13 to 52) would have to be vaccinated to prevent one episode of pneumonia. Vaccination made no difference in the risk of pneumococcal pneumonia due to S pneumoniae or in the chance of dying or of being admitted to hospital. People who were vaccinated were less likely to experience a COPD exacerbation; eight people with COPD (95% CI 5 to 58) would have to be vaccinated to prevent one person from having an acute exacerbation. We found no difference in effectiveness between the two types of injectable vaccine. 
Quality of the evidence 
Evidence in this review is generally independent and reliable, and we are moderately certain about the results. 
Conclusions 
In line with current guidance, this review suggests that all people with COPD should be given pneumococcal vaccination to provide some protection against community‐acquired pneumonia, and to reduce the chance of an acute exacerbation.","# Plain Language Summary: Pneumococcal Vaccines for People with COPD

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether pneumococcal vaccines (shots) can help prevent pneumonia and other lung problems in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a long-term lung disease that makes it hard to breathe.

## Why is this important?

People with COPD get pneumonia more often than other people. Pneumonia can lead to serious health problems and hospital visits. Researchers wanted to know if a vaccine could help prevent this.

## What did researchers do?

Scientists reviewed 12 studies involving 2,171 people with COPD. The average age was 66 years old, and most were men. They compared two types of pneumococcal vaccines against a control group (people who didn't get the vaccine).

## What were the main findings?

**Pneumonia prevention:** People who got the vaccine were less likely to develop pneumonia. Out of every 19 vaccinated people, one person avoided getting pneumonia.

**COPD flare-ups:** The vaccine also reduced sudden worsening of COPD symptoms. Out of every 8 vaccinated people, one person avoided a flare-up.

**Death rates:** The vaccine did not change how many people died from heart or lung problems, or from any cause.

**Hospital visits:** Hospital admissions were similar in both groups.

**Side effects:** One study found mild side effects were slightly more common with one vaccine type, but these were not serious.

## Bottom line

Pneumococcal vaccines appear to help people with COPD by reducing pneumonia and sudden lung flare-ups. The benefits are moderate but meaningful.","### Summary of the Vaccine Study for People with Lung Disease

**Who Was Studied?**
The study looked at people with a lung disease called COPD. It included 2,171 participants with an average age of 66, most of whom were men.

**What Was the Study About?**
Researchers wanted to see if a special injectable vaccine could help prevent pneumonia in people with COPD.

**What Did They Do?**
They looked at 12 different studies where people got either the real vaccine or something else (like a different vaccine or no vaccine) and compared the outcomes.

**What Were the Main Findings?**
- People who got the vaccine were less likely to get pneumonia that spreads in the community.
- The vaccine didn't show a big effect specifically on a less common type called pneumococcal pneumonia.
- The vaccine helped lower the chances of serious lung flare-ups from COPD.
- Getting the vaccine did not change the death rates or the number of hospital visits.

**Safety**
Some mild side effects happened with one type of the vaccine, but nothing severe was noted.

**Conclusion**
The vaccine helps protect against common types of pneumonia and lung flare-ups in people with COPD but doesn’t show a big difference in preventing a specific type of pneumonia. More studies are needed to compare different vaccines."
"Background
There is significant uncertainty in the treatment of intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma which is defined by the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) as hepatocellular carcinoma stage B with large, multi‐nodular, Child‐Pugh status A to B, performance status 0 to 2, and without vascular occlusion or extrahepatic disease. 
Objectives
To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions used in the treatment of intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma (BCLC stage B) through a network meta‐analysis and to generate rankings of the available interventions according to their safety and efficacy. However, we found only one comparison. Therefore, we did not perform the network meta‐analysis, and we assessed the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions versus each other, or versus placebo, sham, or no intervention (supportive treatment only) using standard Cochrane methodology. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and randomised clinical trials registers to September 2016 to identify randomised clinical trials on hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Selection criteria
We included only randomised clinical trials, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status, in participants with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma, irrespective of the presence of cirrhosis, size, or number of the tumours (provided they met the criteria of intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma), of presence or absence of portal hypertension, of aetiology of hepatocellular carcinoma, and of the future remnant liver volume. We excluded trials which included participants who had previously undergone liver transplantation. We considered any of the various interventions compared with each other or with no active intervention (supportive treatment only). We excluded trials which compared variations of the same intervention: for example, different methods of performing transarterial chemoembolisation. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We calculated the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using both fixed‐effect and random‐effects models based on available‐participant analysis with Review Manager. We assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane, controlled risk of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis using Stata, and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
Three randomised clinical trials, including 430 participants, met the inclusion criteria for this review; however, data from two trials with 412 participants could be included in only one primary outcome (i.e. mortality). All three trials were at high risk of bias. All three trials included supportive care as cointervention. The comparisons included in the two trials reporting on mortality were: systemic chemotherapy with sorafenib versus no active intervention; and transarterial chemoembolisation plus systemic chemotherapy with sorafenib versus transarterial chemoembolisation alone. The trials did not report the duration of follow‐up; however, it appeared that the participants were followed up for a period of about 18 to 30 months. The majority of the participants in the trials had cirrhotic livers. The trials included participants with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma arising from viral and non‐viral aetiologies. The trials did not report the portal hypertension status of the participants. The mortality was 50% to 70% over a median follow‐up period of 18 to 30 months. There was no evidence of difference in mortality at maximal follow‐up between systemic chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.18; participants = 412; studies = 2; I2 = 0%; very low quality evidence). A subgroup analysis performed by stratifying the analysis by the presence or absence of transarterial chemoembolisation as cointervention did not alter the results. None of the trials reported on serious adverse events other than mortality, health‐related quality of life, recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma, or length of hospital stay. One of the trials providing data was funded by the pharmaceutical industry, the other did not report the source of funding, and the trial with no data for the review was also funded by the pharmaceutical industry. We found two ongoing trials. 
Authors' conclusions
Currently, there is no evidence from randomised clinical trials that people with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma would benefit from systemic chemotherapy with sorafenib either alone or when transarterial chemoembolisation was used as a cointervention (very low quality evidence). We need high‐quality randomised clinical trials designed to measure differences in clinically important outcomes (e.g. all‐cause mortality or health‐related quality of life).","Treatment of intermediate‐stage primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma)
Background 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer) arises from the liver cells and is distinct from secondary liver cancer, arising from other parts of the body and spreading to the liver. Hepatocellular carcinoma can be classified in many ways. One classification is by Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) group stage which classifies the cancer based on how long the person is expected to live (life expectancy). This classification is broadly based on the size of the cancer, number of cancers in the liver, how well the liver works, and whether one's activities are affected by the cancer. People with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma have large, multiple cancers, but they do not have full‐blown liver failure. Cancer is confined to the liver, and there is no restriction of daily activities. There is significant uncertainty in the treatment of people with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma. We sought to resolve this uncertainty by searching for existing studies on the topic. We included all randomised clinical trials (well‐designed clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) whose results were reported to September 2016. We included only trials in which participants with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma had not undergone liver transplantation previously. Apart from using standard Cochrane methods which allow comparison of only two treatments at a time (direct comparison), we planned to use an advanced method which allows comparison of the many different treatments that are individually compared in the trials (network meta‐analysis). However, because there was only one comparison, we could only use standard Cochrane methodology. 
Study characteristics 
Only three trials with 430 participants met our inclusion criteria; however, two of the trials (412 participants) only reported death and no other measures of how well the treatments worked. All three trials included supportive care (treatment to prevent, control, or relieve complications and side effects and improve comfort and quality of life) as a co‐intervention. The trials assessed transarterial chemoembolisation (where anti‐cancer drugs block the blood supply and treat the cancer through the vessels supplying the cancer), chemotherapy using sorafenib (a drug which blocks cancer growth), or a combination of transarterial chemoembolisation and sorafenib. It appeared that the trials followed participants for about 18 to 30 months from the initiation of treatment. 
Two trials were funded by the pharmaceutical industry; one trial did not report the source of funding. 
Key results 
Over 18 to 30 months, 50% to 75% of participants died. There was no evidence of any difference between the people who received chemotherapy and those who did not receive chemotherapy. None of the trials reported complications, health‐related quality of life (a measure of a person's satisfaction with their life and health), cancer recurrence, or length of hospital stay. Overall, there is currently no evidence for benefit of any active treatment in addition to supportive treatment for intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma. There is significant uncertainty on this and further high‐quality randomised clinical trials are required. 
Quality of evidence 
The overall quality of evidence was low or very low and all the trials were at high risk of bias, which means that there is possibility of making the wrong conclusions, overestimating benefits, or underestimating harms of one treatment or the other because of the way that the trials were conducted.","# Plain Language Summary: Treatment for Intermediate-Stage Liver Cancer

## What is this study about?

This review looked at different treatments for a specific type of liver cancer called intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. Doctors weren't sure which treatment worked best, so researchers wanted to compare the available options.

## Who was studied?

The review included 430 people from three research studies who had intermediate-stage liver cancer. Most of these people also had cirrhosis (scarring of the liver).

## What treatments were tested?

The studies compared:
- A drug called sorafenib (a type of chemotherapy given by mouth) versus no active treatment
- A combination of sorafenib plus a procedure called transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE—where medicine is injected directly into blood vessels feeding the tumor) versus TACE alone

All participants also received supportive care (treatment to help manage symptoms).

## What were the results?

The researchers found **no clear difference** in how long people lived when comparing sorafenib treatment to no treatment. About half to two-thirds of people in the studies died during the follow-up period (roughly 18 to 30 months).

## Quality of the evidence

The review noted that all three studies had problems with how they were designed, making the results less reliable. The evidence was rated as ""very low quality.""

## What's missing?

The studies didn't report on:
- Serious side effects (other than death)
- Quality of life
- How long people stayed in the hospital

## Bottom line

Right now, there is **no proof** that sorafenib helps people with intermediate-stage liver cancer live longer. Better-designed studies are needed to find the best treatment options.","### Plain Language Summary

#### What is the study about?

This study looks at different ways to treat a certain liver cancer called intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. Researchers want to find out which treatments work best and are safest for people with this kind of cancer.

#### What did the researchers do?

They looked for studies that tested different treatments for this type of liver cancer. They found a few studies that tried different methods, like using a drug called sorafenib or a procedure called transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE).

#### What did they find?

- Three studies with a total of 430 participants were included. Most of these people had another liver condition called cirrhosis.
- The studies compared using the drug sorafenib alone or with TACE to no treatment at all.
- They found that using sorafenib, with or without TACE, didn't show a clear difference in survival rates compared to not using it (the chance of living longer didn’t change much).
- The studies lasted between 18 to 30 months. During this time, about 50% to 70% of the participants passed away.
- The studies didn’t report other important things like side effects or quality of life.

#### Were there problems with the study?

Yes, the studies had a high risk of bias, which means there might be mistakes or unfairness in how they were done. Also, not all important outcomes were measured, and some studies were funded by drug companies.

#### What do the researchers conclude?

Right now, there isn’t enough evidence to show that the drug sorafenib helps people with this type of liver cancer live longer. There need to be better quality studies that look at the important outcomes, like survival and quality of life.

#### What's next?

More high-quality studies are needed to understand which treatments can really help people with this liver cancer."
"Background
When women require induction of labour, oxytocin is the most common agent used, delivered by an intravenous infusion titrated to uterine contraction strength and frequency. There is debate over the optimum dose regimen and how it impacts on maternal and fetal outcomes, particularly induction to birth interval, mode of birth, and rates of hyperstimulation. Current induction of labour regimens include both high‐ and low‐dose regimens and are delivered by either continuous or pulsed infusions, with both linear and non‐linear incremental increases in oxytocin dose. Whilst low‐dose protocols bring on contractions safely, their potentially slow induction to birth interval may increase the chance of fetal infection and chorioamnionitis. Conversely, high‐dose protocols may cause undue uterine hyperstimulation and fetal distress. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of high‐ versus low‐dose oxytocin for induction of labour at term 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (31 August 2014) and the reference lists of relevant papers. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials that compared oxytocin protocol for induction of labour for women at term, where high‐dose oxytocin is at least 100 mU oxytocin in the first 40 minutes, with increments delivering at least 600 mU in the first two hours, compared with low‐dose oxytocin, defined as less than 100 mU oxytocin in the first 40 minutes, and increments delivering less than 600 mU total in the first two hours. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data were checked for accuracy. 
Main results
We have included nine trials, involving 2391 women and their babies in this review. Trials were at a moderate to high risk of bias overall. 
Results of primary outcomes revealed no significant differences in rates of vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.14, two trials, 1339 women) or caesarean section (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.14, eight trials, 2023 women). There was no difference in serious maternal morbidity or death (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.82, one trial, 523 women), and no difference in serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.23 to 3.12, one trial, 781 infants). Finally, no trials reported on the number of women who had uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes. 
Results of secondary outcomes revealed no difference between time from induction to delivery (mean difference (MD) ‐0.90 hours, 95% CI ‐2.28 to +0.49 hours; five studies), uterine rupture (RR 3.10, 95% CI 0.50 to 19.33; three trials), epidural analgesia (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.18; two trials), instrumental birth (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.66; three trials), Apgar less than seven at five minutes (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.01, five trials), perinatal death (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.23 to 3.12; two trials), postpartum haemorrhage (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.34; five trials), or endometritis (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.53 to 3.43; three trials). Removal of high bias studies reveals a significant reduction of induction to delivery interval (MD ‐1.94 hours, 95% CI ‐0.99 to ‐2.89 hours, 489 women). A significant increase in hyperstimulation without specifying fetal heart rate changes was found in the high‐dose group (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.55 to 2.25). 
No other secondary outcomes were reported: unchanged/unfavourable cervix after 12 to 24 hours, meconium‐stained liquor, neonatal intensive care unit admission, neonatal encephalopathy, disability in childhood, other maternal side‐effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea), maternal antibiotic use, maternal satisfaction, neonatal infection and neonatal antibiotic use. 
Authors' conclusions
The findings of our review do not provide evidence that high‐dose oxytocin increases either vaginal delivery within 24 hours or the caesarean section rate. There is no significant decrease in induction to delivery time at meta‐analysis but these results may be confounded by poor quality trials. High‐dose oxytocin was shown to increase the rate of uterine hyperstimulation but the effects of this are not clear. The conclusions here are specific to the definitions used in this review. Further trials evaluating the effects of high‐dose regimens of oxytocin for induction of labour should consider all important maternal and infant outcomes.","High‐dose versus low‐dose oxytocin infusion regimens for induction of labour
Some women do not begin labour spontaneously and may need assistance. This assistance, known as induction of labour, involves the use of an intervention to artificially commence uterine contractions for the mother. Oxytocin is a drug that is commonly given to women for induction of labour; however the most suitable dose to enable birth to occur safely for the mother and her baby, within a reasonable timeframe, is not known. 
We included nine randomised controlled trials involving 2391 women and their babies in this review. The trials were of moderate quality overall. All trials compared giving women a high dose versus a low dose of oxytocin for induction of labour. We found that women who had a high dose of oxytocin were not more likely to have a shorter induction to delivery interval or have a vaginal birth within 24 hours of receiving the treatment than women receiving a low dose of oxytocin. When poor‐quality trials are removed from analysis however, the induction to delivery interval was significantly shorter with high‐dose oxytocin compared to low‐dose oxytocin. The likelihood of having a caesarean was similar with the different doses of oxytocin for induction of labour. No differences were shown between the two groups of women in terms of serious complications, including death of the mother or her baby but women receiving the high‐dose oxytocin did have an increased risk of excessive uterine contractions (known as uterine hyperstimulation). No trials provided any information about the number of women with uterine hyperstimulation with changes in the babies' heart rate. Similarly, no trials assessed satisfaction of the mother or her caregivers. 
The trials were at moderate to high risk of bias overall. The definition of high‐ and low‐dose protocols and the outcomes measured varied considerably across the trials. The current evidence is not strong enough to recommend high‐dose over low‐dose regimens for routine induction of labour. We recommend that further research is carried out.","# Plain Language Summary: Oxytocin Doses for Labor Induction

## What is this study about?

This study compared two different doses of a medicine called oxytocin that doctors use to start labor in pregnant women at full term (ready to deliver). Researchers wanted to find out if using a higher dose or a lower dose works better and is safer.

## Why does this matter?

When labor doesn't start on its own, doctors give oxytocin through an IV (needle in the arm) to help the uterus contract and move labor along. Doctors aren't sure which dose is best. Some worry that low doses take too long and might increase infection risk. Others worry that high doses might cause the uterus to contract too much and stress the baby.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at 9 studies that included 2,391 pregnant women and babies. They compared:
- **High-dose oxytocin**: larger amounts given quickly in the first two hours
- **Low-dose oxytocin**: smaller amounts given more slowly in the first two hours

## What did they find?

**Main results:**
- Both doses had similar rates of vaginal delivery and cesarean sections
- Both were similarly safe for mothers and babies
- High-dose oxytocin caused more uterine hyperstimulation (the uterus contracting too much), but it's unclear if this caused harm

**Time to delivery:**
- High-dose oxytocin may have shortened labor by about 2 hours, but the evidence wasn't strong

## Bottom line

The study found no clear winner between high and low doses for most outcomes. High-dose oxytocin does cause more uterine over-contracting, but doctors need more research to understand if this matters.","### Plain Language Summary

This study looked at how safe and effective different doses of a medicine called oxytocin are when used to help start labor in pregnant women. Oxytocin helps cause contractions so the baby can be born. There are two ways to give oxytocin: in high doses or low doses. The right dose is important because too little might slow down labor, and too much might cause too many strong contractions, which could be risky for the baby.

**Purpose of the Study:**

The goal was to see if high doses or low doses of oxytocin are better for starting labor when a woman is ready to have her baby. The study wanted to know which dose is safer and more effective.

**Who was in the Study:**

The study looked at 2,391 pregnant women and their babies.

**Main Findings:**

1. **Vaginal Birth Time:** There wasn't a clear difference between high and low doses in how quickly women gave birth vaginally.
   
2. **C-section Rates:** The number of C-sections (surgical births) was about the same for both doses.

3. **Safety:** Serious health problems for mothers or babies were similar for both doses.

4. **Contractions:** Women who got high doses had more strong contractions, but it's not certain what this means for babies' health.

5. **Other Health Issues:** There were no big differences in other health problems, like heavy bleeding after birth or infections.

**Conclusion:**

The study showed that high doses of oxytocin didn't help women give birth faster or reduce the need for C-sections. High doses did cause more strong contractions, but the effect of this is not clear. This study suggests more research is needed to understand the best way to use oxytocin for starting labor."
"Background
Antibiotics alter the microbial balance commonly resulting in antibiotic‐associated diarrhea (AAD). Probiotics may prevent AAD via providing gut barrier, restoration of the gut microflora, and other potential mechanisms of action. 
Objectives
The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose) used for the prevention of AAD in children. 
Search methods
MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and the Web of Science (inception to 28 May 2018) were searched along with registers including the ISRCTN and Clinicaltrials.gov. We also searched the NICE Evidence Services database as well as reference lists from relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomized, parallel, controlled trials in children (0 to 18 years) receiving antibiotics, that compare probiotics to placebo, active alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment and measure the incidence of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use were considered for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently by two authors. Dichotomous data (incidence of AAD, adverse events) were combined using a pooled risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD), and continuous data (mean duration of diarrhea) as mean difference (MD), along with corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) where appropriate. For studies reporting on microbiome characteristics using heterogeneous outcomes, we describe the results narratively. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using GRADE. 
Main results
Thirty‐three studies (6352 participants) were included. Probiotics assessed included Bacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium butyricum, Lactobacilli spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc cremoris, Saccharomyces spp., orStreptococcus spp., alone or in combination. The risk of bias was determined to be high in 20 studies and low in 13 studies. Complete case (patients who did not complete the studies were not included in the analysis) results from 33 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea show a precise benefit from probiotics compared to active, placebo or no treatment control. 
After 5 days to 12 weeks of follow‐up, the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (259/3232) compared to 19% (598/3120) in the control group (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.56; I² = 57%, 6352 participants; NNTB 9, 95% CI 7 to 13; moderate certainty evidence). Nineteen studies had loss to follow‐up ranging from 1% to 46%. After making assumptions for those lost, the observed benefit was still statistically significant using an extreme plausible intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis, wherein the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 12% (436/3551) compared to 19% (664/3468) in the control group (7019 participants; RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.77; P <0.00001; I² = 70%). An a priori available case subgroup analysis exploring heterogeneity indicated that high dose (≥ 5 billion CFUs per day) is more effective than low probiotic dose (< 5 billion CFUs per day), interaction P value = 0.01. For the high dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (162/2029) compared to 23% (462/2009) in the control group (4038 participants; RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.46; P = 0.06; moderate certainty evidence). For the low dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (97/1155) compared to 13% (133/1059) in the control group (2214 participants; RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.01; P = 0.02). Again, assumptions for loss to follow‐up using an extreme plausible ITT analysis was statistically significant. For high dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 13% (278/2218) compared to 23% (503/2207) in control group (4425 participants; RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.70; P <0.00001; I² = 68%; moderate certainty evidence). 
None of the 24 trials (4415 participants) that reported on adverse events reported any serious adverse events attributable to probiotics. Adverse event rates were low. After 5 days to 4 weeks follow‐up, 4% (86/2229) of probiotics participants had an adverse event compared to 6% (121/2186) of control participants (RD 0.00; 95% CI ‐0.01 to 0.01; P < 0.00001; I² = 75%; low certainty evidence). Common adverse events included rash, nausea, gas, flatulence, abdominal bloating, and constipation. 
After 10 days to 12 weeks of follow‐up, eight studies recorded data on our secondary outcome, the mean duration of diarrhea; with probiotics reducing diarrhea duration by almost one day (MD ‐0.91; 95% CI ‐1.38 to ‐0.44; P <0.00001; low certainty evidence). One study reported on microbiome characteristics, reporting no difference in changes with concurrent antibiotic and probiotic use. 
Authors' conclusions
The overall evidence suggests a moderate protective effect of probiotics for preventing AAD (NNTB 9, 95% CI 7 to 13). Using five criteria to evaluate the credibility of the subgroup analysis on probiotic dose, the results indicate the subgroup effect based on high dose probiotics (≥ 5 billion CFUs per day) was credible. Based on high‐dose probiotics, the NNTB to prevent one case of diarrhea is 6 (95% CI 5 to 9). The overall certainty of the evidence for the primary endpoint, incidence of AAD, based on high dose probiotics was moderate due to the minor issues with risk of bias and inconsistency related to a diversity of probiotic agents used. Evidence also suggests that probiotics may moderately reduce the duration of diarrhea, a reduction by almost one day. The benefit of high dose probiotics (e.g. Lactobacillus rhamnosus orSaccharomyces boulardii) needs to be confirmed by a large well‐designed multi‐centered randomized trial. It is premature to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy and safety of 'other' probiotic agents as an adjunct to antibiotics in children. Adverse event rates were low and no serious adverse events were attributable to probiotics. Although no serious adverse events were observed among inpatient and outpatient children, including small studies conducted in the intensive care unit and in the neonatal unit, observational studies not included in this review have reported serious adverse events in severely debilitated or immuno‐compromised children with underlying risk factors including central venous catheter use and disorders associated with bacterial/fungal translocation.","Probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic‐associated diarrhea in children
What is antibiotic‐associated diarrhea? 
Antibiotic‐associated diarrhea (AAD) occurs when antibiotics disturb the natural balance of ""good"" and ""bad"" bacteria in the intestinal tract causing harmful bacteria to multiply beyond their normal numbers. The symptoms of AAD include frequent watery bowel movements and crampy abdominal pain. 
What are probiotics? 
Probiotics are found in dietary supplements or yogurts and contain potentially beneficial bacteria or yeast. Probiotics may restore the natural balance of bacteria in the intestinal tract. 
What did the researchers investigate? 
The researchers investigated whether probiotics prevent AAD in children receiving antibiotic therapy and whether probiotics causes any harms (side effects). The researchers searched the medical literature extensively up to May 28, 2018. 
What did the researchers find? 
Thirty‐three studies were reviewed and provide the best available evidence. The studies tested 6352 children (3 days to 17 years of age) who were receiving probiotics co‐administered with antibiotics to prevent AAD. The participants received probiotics (Lactobacilli spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Streptococcus spp., or Saccharomyces boulardii alone or in combination), placebo (pills not including probiotics), other treatments thought to prevent AAD (i.e. diosmectite or infant formula) or no treatment. The studies were short‐term, ranging in length from 5 days to 12 weeks. Analyses showed that probiotics are effective for preventing AAD. The incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (259/3232) compared to 19% (598/3120) in the control group, demonstrating a moderate reduction (11% fewer will suffer diarrhea). For every 9 children treated, probiotics will prevent one case of diarrhea. Further, evidence suggests that higher dose probiotics (≥ 5 billion CFUs per day) reduce the incidence of AAD. Eight per cent (162/2029) of the high dose probiotics group had AAD compared to 23% (462/2009) in the control group, demonstrating a moderate to large reduction (15% fewer suffer diarrhea). Probiotics were generally well tolerated, and minor side effects (e.g. rash, nausea, gas, flatulence, abdominal bloating, constipation) occurred infrequently. . Evidence suggested that probiotics are effective for a moderate reduction in duration of diarrhea (almost one day). Among the various probiotics evaluated, Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Saccharomyces boulardii at 5 to 40 billion colony forming units/day appear most appropriate for preventing AAD in children receiving antibiotics. It is premature to draw conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of 'other' probiotic agents for preventing AAD. Although no serious probiotic‐related side effects were observed among the mostly otherwise healthy children who participated in the studies, serious side effects have been reported in observational studies not included in this review, including severely debilitated or immuno‐compromised children with underlying risk factors including central venous catheter (a flexible tube used to give medicines) use and disorders associated with bacterial or fungal translocation (the passage of bacteria from the gut to other areas of the body).","# Plain Language Summary: Can Probiotics Prevent Diarrhea from Antibiotics in Children?

## What is this study about?

When children take antibiotics, the medicine can kill helpful bacteria in their stomach and cause diarrhea. Researchers wanted to know if probiotics (good bacteria) can prevent this type of diarrhea.

## Who was studied?

Scientists looked at 33 different studies involving 6,352 children (ages 0–18 years) who were taking antibiotics.

## What did they test?

Researchers compared children who received probiotics to children who received a fake treatment (placebo) or no treatment. They measured how many children got diarrhea and if there were any side effects.

## What did they find?

**Main Results:**
- Children taking probiotics had diarrhea 8% of the time
- Children not taking probiotics had diarrhea 19% of the time
- This means probiotics cut the risk of diarrhea in half

**For higher doses** (5 billion or more bacteria per day):
- Probiotics worked even better
- Only 8% of children taking high-dose probiotics got diarrhea versus 23% without

**Duration:**
- When children did get diarrhea, it lasted almost one day shorter with probiotics

**Safety:**
- Very few side effects occurred (4% with probiotics vs. 6% without)
- No serious side effects from probiotics were reported
- Common mild side effects included rash, nausea, gas, and bloating

## Bottom line

Probiotics appear to help prevent antibiotic-related diarrhea in children, especially at higher doses. They seem safe with minimal side effects. However, researchers want larger studies to confirm these findings.","### Simple Summary of Probiotic Study for Kids Taking Antibiotics

**Why This Study Happened:**
When kids take antibiotics, it can sometimes cause diarrhea. Researchers wanted to see if taking probiotics (good bacteria) can help prevent this.

**Who Was Studied:**
The study looked at kids aged 0 to 18 who were taking antibiotics. They compared those who took probiotics to those who didn't.

**What They Did:**
- Researchers reviewed 33 studies involving 6,352 kids.
- They looked at different types of probiotics to see if they helped prevent diarrhea.

**What They Found:**
- Children who took probiotics had less diarrhea (8 out of 100) compared to children who didn’t (19 out of 100).
- High doses of probiotics worked better than low doses.
- Probiotics also shortened the time kids had diarrhea by almost one day.

**Safety:**
- No serious side effects were linked to probiotics.
- A few kids had mild reactions like rash or gas.

**Conclusion:**
Probiotics can help reduce diarrhea in kids taking antibiotics, especially with higher doses. More research is needed to find out which probiotics work best. Overall, probiotics are safe with minor side effects."
"Background
A pressure ulcer is defined as ""an area of localized injury to the skin and/or underlying tissue, usually over a bony prominence, as a result of pressure, or pressure in combination with shear"". The use of phototherapy ‐ that is, light (or laser) used as an adjuvant, non‐surgical intervention, with the aim of having a therapeutic effect on healing ‐ has increased recently. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of phototherapy on the healing of pressure ulcers.
Search methods
In January 2014, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid EMBASE; Ovid MEDLINE (In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); and EBSCO CINAHL. We did not restrict the search by language or publication date. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of phototherapy (in addition to standard treatment) with sham phototherapy (in addition to standard treatment), another type of phototherapy (in addition to standard treatment) or standard or conventional treatment alone. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed studies for relevance and design according to the selection criteria, extracted data and evaluated study quality. The authors made attempts to obtain missing data by contacting study authors. Disagreement was resolved by consensus and discussion with a third review author. 
Main results
We identified seven RCTs involving 403 participants. All the trials were at unclear risk of bias. Trials compared the use of phototherapy with standard care only (six trials) or sham phototherapy (one trial). Only one of the trials included a third arm in which another type of phototherapy was applied. Overall, there was insufficient evidence to determine the relative effects of phototherapy for healing pressure ulcers. Time to complete healing was reported in three studies. Two studies showed the ultraviolet (UV) treated group had a shorter mean time to complete healing than the control group (mean difference ‐2.13 weeks (95% CI ‐3.53 to ‐0.72, P value 0.003)). One study reported that the laser group had a longer mean time to complete healing than the control group (mean difference 5.77 weeks; 95% CI ‐0.25 to 11.79). However, this result should be interpreted with caution, as these were small studies and the findings may have been due to chance. Three studies reported proportions of ulcers healed with a variety of results. One study reported a different outcome measure, and the other two studies had different treatment durations. These variations did not allow us to pool the studies and draw any conclusions as to whether phototherapy is effective or not. Adverse effects were reported in only two studies that compared phototherapy with control; the risk ratio for adverse events was imprecise. One study reported risk ratio (RR) 0.72 (95%CI 0.18 to 2.80). However, another study reported RR 0.89 (95% CI: 0.71 to 1.12) based on the number of events in each group, rather than the number of people with events. Among five studies reporting the rate of change in ulcer area, three studies found no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Pooling was not undertaken because of differences in outcome measures reported. The results were based on data from trials with unclear risk of bias for which generation of the randomisation sequence, concealment allocation and blinding of outcome assessors were unclear. No studies reported on quality of life, length of hospital stay, pain or cost. 
Authors' conclusions
We are very uncertain as to the effects of phototherapy in treating pressure ulcers. The quality of evidence is very low due to the unclear risk of bias and small number of trials available for analysis. The possibility of benefit or harm of this treatment cannot be ruled out. Further research is recommended.","Phototherapy for treating pressure ulcers
What are pressure ulcers? 
Pressure ulcers (also called bed sores or pressure sores) are sores on the skin caused by constant pressure or friction. They usually affect people who are immobilised or find it difficult to move themselves, for example the elderly or paralysed. Pressure ulcers frequently occur on bony parts of the body, such as the heels and hips, and also on the coccyx (tail bone). Pressure ulcers do not always heal, and, if they do heal, healing can take a long time. 
What is phototherapy? 
Phototherapy is a treatment in which part of the body is exposed to daylight, a or light of a specific wavelength. It is used for treating a variety of diseases, and may involve lights and lasers. Phototherapy is used to treat pressure ulcers in the hope that it will reduce the time the ulcers take to heal. 
The purpose of this review 
This review tried to find out whether phototherapy treatment(s) given in addition to standard care (i.e. pressure relief, removal of dead tissue from the wound, infection control and application of dressings) improves healing times for pressure ulcers. Standard care plus phototherapy could be compared against standard care alone, or against standard care plus sham phototherapy, or against standard care plus another type of phototherapy. 
Findings of this review 
The review authors searched the medical literature up to 7 January 2014, and identified seven relevant medical trials, with a total of 403 participants. Six trials compared the use of phototherapy with standard care only; one trial compared it with standard care plus sham phototherapy. Only one trial included a third treatment group that investigated another type of phototherapy. 
Two trials reported the time taken for pressure ulcers to heal completely, and these showed an improvement in healing time for people in the phototherapy group who received treatment with ultraviolet light. However, this result should be interpreted with caution, as these were small, poor quality trials, at unclear risk of bias (i.e. with potentially misleading results), and the findings may have been due to chance. The other trials reported either conflicting results or various measures/time points among trials, which meant that we could not conclude whether or not phototherapy is effective for treating pressure ulcers. Two trials reported incidence of harmful (adverse) effects and noted no significant differences between the phototherapy and standard treatment groups. Four trials provided funding information, two from industry funding, the others from an institutional grant. No studies reported on quality of life, length of hospital stay, pain or cost. 
This review identified only a few, small studies provided with insufficient evidence to support the use of phototherapy as a routine treatment for pressure ulcers. More trials will need to be conducted before it can be established whether this treatment works and is safe.","# Plain Language Summary: Light Therapy for Pressure Ulcers

## What is this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if light therapy (using special lights or lasers) helps heal pressure ulcers—painful sores that form on the skin when people stay in one position too long.

## Who was studied?

The researchers looked at 7 different studies involving 403 people total. These studies tested whether light therapy worked better than regular care alone or fake light therapy.

## What did they test?

The studies compared:
- Light therapy plus regular care vs. regular care only
- Light therapy plus regular care vs. fake light therapy
- Different types of light therapy

## What did they find?

**Healing time:** Some studies using ultraviolet (UV) light showed wounds healed about 2 weeks faster than with regular care. However, one study using laser light showed the opposite—wounds took 6 weeks longer to heal. These results were small and might have happened by chance.

**Number of ulcers healed:** Different studies measured this differently, so researchers couldn't combine the results to reach a clear answer.

**Side effects:** Only 2 studies reported on side effects, and the information wasn't clear enough to draw conclusions.

**Other factors:** No studies measured pain relief, hospital stay length, quality of life, or cost.

## Bottom line

The researchers found **not enough good evidence** to say whether light therapy actually works for pressure ulcers. More and better research is needed before we know if this treatment helps.","### Plain Language Summary: Phototherapy for Pressure Ulcers

**Purpose of the Study:**
This study looked at whether using light (phototherapy) helps heal pressure ulcers, which are sores that develop from too much pressure on the skin, often over bony areas.

**Who Was Involved:**
The study examined 403 people with pressure ulcers through seven different tests.

**What Was Done:**
Researchers compared regular treatment alone to regular treatment plus light therapy. Some treatments used a fake light as a comparison.

**What They Found:**
- Two studies suggested that ultraviolet (UV) light might help heal sores faster.
- One study showed that laser light took longer to heal sores.
- Results were mixed, and it's unclear if light therapy works better than regular treatment.
- Adverse effects (unwanted side effects) were not clearly different between those who had light therapy and those who didn't.

**Safety and Other Factors:**
- There wasn’t enough information to say if the light treatment was safe or not.
- Important aspects like quality of life, pain, and costs were not measured.

**Conclusion:**
The study couldn’t clearly prove if light therapy helps with pressure ulcers because the studies had unclear methods and there weren’t enough of them. More research is needed to find out if this treatment is helpful or harmful."
"Background
Efficacy and the risk of severe late effects have to be well‐balanced in treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Late adverse effects include secondary malignancies which often have a poor prognosis. To synthesise evidence on the risk of secondary malignancies after current treatment approaches comprising chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, we performed a meta‐analysis based on individual patient data (IPD) from patients treated for newly diagnosed HL. 
Objectives
We investigated several questions concerning possible changes in the risk of secondary malignancies when modifying chemotherapy or radiotherapy (omission of radiotherapy, reduction of the radiation field, reduction of the radiation dose, use of fewer chemotherapy cycles, intensification of chemotherapy). We also analysed whether these modifications affect progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL trials databases comprehensively in June 2010 for all randomised trials in HL since 1984. Key international trials registries were also searched. The search was updated in March 2015 without collecting further IPD (one further eligible study found) and again in July 2017 (no further eligible studies). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for untreated HL patients which enrolled at least 50 patients per arm, completed recruitment by 2007 and performed a treatment comparison relevant to our objectives. 
Data collection and analysis
Study groups submitted IPD, including age, sex, stage and the outcomes secondary malignant neoplasm (SMN), OS and PFS as time‐to‐event data. We meta‐analysed these data using Petos method (SMN) and Cox regression with inverse‐variance pooling (OS, PFS) for each of the five study questions, and performed subgroup and sensitivity analyses to assess the applicability and robustness of the results. 
Main results
We identified 21 eligible trials and obtained IPD for 16. For four studies no data were supplied despite repeated efforts, while one study was only identified in 2015 and IPD were not sought. For each study question, between three and six trials with between 1101 and 2996 participants in total and median follow‐up between 6.7 and 10.8 years were analysed. All participants were adults and mainly under 60 years. Risk of bias was assessed as low for the majority of studies and outcomes. 
Chemotherapy alone versus same chemotherapy plus radiotherapy.  Omitting additional radiotherapy probably reduces secondary malignancy incidence (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.82, low quality of evidence), corresponding to an estimated reduction of eight‐year SMN risk from 8% to 4%. This decrease was particularly true for secondary acute leukemias. However, we had insufficient evidence to determine whether OS rates differ between patients treated with chemotherapy alone versus combined‐modality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.11, moderate quality of evidence). There was a slightly higher rate of PFS with combined modality, but our confidence in the results was limited by high levels of statistical heterogeneity between studies (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.73, moderate quality of evidence). 
Chemotherapy plus involved‐field radiation versus same chemotherapy plus extended‐field radiation (early stages) . There is insufficient evidence to determine whether smaller radiation field reduces SMN risk (Peto OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.16, low quality of evidence), OS (HR 0.89, 95% C: 0.70 to 1.12, high quality of evidence) or PFS (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.21, high quality of evidence). 
Chemotherapy plus lower‐dose radiation versus same chemotherapy plus higher‐dose radiation (early stages).  There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of lower‐radiation dose on SMN risk (Peto OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.50, low quality of evidence), OS (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.28, high quality of evidence) or PFS (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.48, high quality of evidence). 
Fewer versus more courses of chemotherapy (each with or without radiotherapy; early stages).  Fewer chemotherapy courses probably has little or no effect on SMN risk (Peto OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.62), OS (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.73 to1.34) or PFS (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.45).Outcomes had a moderate (SMN) or high (OS, PFS) quality of evidence. 
Dose‐intensified versus ABVD‐like chemotherapy  (with or without radiotherapy in each case). In the mainly advanced‐stage patients who were treated with intensified chemotherapy, the rate of secondary malignancies was low. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of chemotherapy intensification (Peto OR 1.37, CI 0.89 to 2.10, low quality of evidence). The rate of secondary acute leukemias (and for younger patients, all secondary malignancies) was probably higher than among those who had treatment with standard‐dose ABVD‐like protocols. In contrast, the intensified chemotherapy protocols probably improved PFS (eight‐year PFS 75% versus 69% for ABVD‐like treatment, HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.95, moderate quality of evidence). Evidence suggesting improved survival with intensified chemotherapy was not conclusive (HR: 0.85, CI 0.70 to 1.04), although escalated‐dose BEACOPP appeared to lengthen survival compared to ABVD‐like chemotherapy (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.79, moderate quality of evidence). 
Generally, we could draw valid conclusions only in terms of secondary haematological malignancies, which usually occur less than 10 years after initial treatment, while follow‐up within the present analysis was too short to record all solid tumours. 
Authors' conclusions
The risk of secondary acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) is increased but efficacy is improved among patients treated with intensified chemotherapy protocols. Treatment decisions must be tailored for individual patients. Consolidating radiotherapy is associated with an increased rate of secondary malignancies; therefore it appears important to define which patients can safely be treated without radiotherapy after chemotherapy, both for early and advanced stages. For early stages, treatment optimisation methods such as use of fewer chemotherapy cycles and reduced field or reduced‐dose radiotherapy did not appear to markedly affect efficacy or secondary malignancy risk. Due to the limited amount of long‐term follow‐up in this meta‐analysis, further long‐term investigations of late events are needed, particularly with respect to secondary solid tumours. Since many older studies have been included, possible improvement of radiotherapy techniques must be considered when interpreting these results.","Optimisation of chemotherapy and radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma patients with respect to second cancers and survival 
Review question 
We aimed to compare various forms of treatment for newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma involving chemotherapy with or without additional radiotherapy. We particularly looked at the risk of second cancers caused by these treatments, although survival and elimination of Hodgkin lymphoma were also investigated. 
Background 
Since Hodgkin lymphoma often afflicts young people and highly effective treatments allow most patients to survive long after their diagnosis, curing the disease has to be weighed against the risk of causing long‐term adverse effects. Second cancers are a particularly severe form of late toxicity after chemotherapy and radiotherapy. We performed a meta‐analysis based on individual patient data from patients treated for newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma in order to compare second cancer risk, survival and Hodgkin‐free survival with various treatment options. These options included: (1) used of chemotherapy with or without additional radiotherapy; (2) use of a more extensive or more restricted radiation field; (3) use of a higher or lower radiation dose; (4) use of more or fewer courses of chemotherapy and (5) use of standard‐dose or dose‐intensified types of chemotherapy. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to July 2017, based on a total of 16 clinical trials which treated people between 1984 and 2007. Four eligible trials were excluded due to failure to obtain individual patient data, while one further eligible trial was identified only in 2015 and data were not sought. For each of the five study questions (see above), data from between three and six trials with between 1101 and 2996 participants were analysed. Each trial's data covered a follow‐up period of between six and 11 years. All included trials employed modern, widely accepted forms of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Patients were non‐elderly adults of both sexes with early or advances stage disease, according to study question. All trials were funded by public bodies or charities without any direct industry funding. 
Key results 
In the comparison of chemotherapy alone versus same chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (all stages), the use of chemotherapy without additional radiotherapy was associated with a lower second cancer risk but possibly at the cost of more growth or regrowth of the disease. 
In the comparison of chemotherapy plus involved‐field radiation versus same chemotherapy plus extended‐field radiation (early stages), neither second cancer risk, survival or Hodgkin‐free survival was markedly different. 
In the comparison of chemotherapy plus lower‐dose radiation versus same chemotherapy plus higher‐dose radiation (early stages), neither second cancer risk, survival or Hodgkin‐free survival was markedly different. 
In the comparison of fewer versus more courses of chemotherapy (early stages), neither second cancer risk, survival or Hodgkin‐free survival was markedly different. 
In the comparison of dose‐intensified versus ABVD‐like chemotherapy (advanced stages), dose‐intensified chemotherapy improved Hodgkin‐free survival, compared with ABVD‐like regimens, at the cost of a greater risk of secondary leukaemia. Evidence suggesting improved survival with intensified chemotherapy was not conclusive, although escalated‐dose BEACOPP appeared to lengthen survival. 
Quality of the evidence 
Evidence concerning survival and Hodgkin‐free survival was of at least moderate quality, while evidence concerning second cancer risk was partly of low quality due to the small numbers of second cancers observed in the trials and too short follow‐up. Thus, conclusions on second cancer risk remain tentative until more longer‐term data are available. Since many older studies have been included, possible improvement of radiotherapy techniques must be considered when interpreting these results. 
The risk of secondary leukaemia is increased among patients treated with intensified chemotherapy protocols; on the other hand these regimens improve Hodgkin‐free survival. Treatment decisions have to be tailored for the individual patients. Consolidating radiotherapy is associated with an increased rate of secondary malignancies; therefore it appears important to define a patient population that can safely be treated without radiotherapy after chemotherapy, both for early and advanced stages. For early stages, treatment optimisation methods such as use of fewer chemotherapy cycles and reduced field or reduced dose radiotherapy did not appear to markedly affect Hodgkin‐free survival or secondary malignancy risk.","# Plain Language Summary: Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment and Secondary Cancers

## What is this study about?

This study looked at how different cancer treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) affect the risk of developing a second cancer later in life. Researchers combined information from 16 previous studies involving nearly 3,000 patients to find the best balance between treating the cancer effectively and avoiding serious side effects.

## Who was studied?

Adults under age 60 who had newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma and received treatment. Most patients were followed for 7–11 years after treatment.

## What did researchers compare?

Researchers looked at five different treatment questions:

1. **Chemotherapy alone vs. chemotherapy plus radiation**
2. **Smaller radiation area vs. larger radiation area** (for early-stage disease)
3. **Lower radiation dose vs. higher radiation dose** (for early-stage disease)
4. **Fewer chemotherapy rounds vs. more rounds** (for early-stage disease)
5. **Stronger chemotherapy vs. standard chemotherapy** (for advanced-stage disease)

## Main findings

**Adding radiation to chemotherapy increases second cancer risk.** Skipping radiation after chemotherapy probably cuts the risk of developing a second cancer in half (from 8% to 4% over 8 years), especially blood cancers. However, adding radiation may help prevent the original cancer from coming back.

**For early-stage disease:** Using fewer chemotherapy rounds, smaller radiation areas, or lower radiation doses did not seem to significantly increase second cancer risk or reduce treatment effectiveness.

**For advanced-stage disease:** Stronger chemotherapy improved cancer control but probably increased the risk of second blood cancers.

## Why is this important?

Doctors now have better information to help choose treatments that work well while reducing the chance of second cancers developing years later. Treatment should be personalized for each patient based on their specific situation.

## Limitations

The studies didn't follow patients long enough to track all types of second cancers, especially solid tumors that develop many years later. Newer radiation techniques may also reduce risks compared to older methods used in these studies.","### Clinical Trial Summary

#### Purpose
This study looked at how changing treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma affects the chance of getting other cancers later on. It focused on deciding the best balance between treatment success and side effects.

#### Who Was Involved?
The study included adults with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma. Most were under 60 years old.

#### What Did They Do?
Researchers compared different treatments:
- Just chemotherapy versus chemotherapy plus radiotherapy
- Different sizes and doses of radiation
- Fewer versus more cycles of chemotherapy
- Regular versus stronger chemotherapy

#### Key Findings
1. **Chemotherapy Alone vs. With Radiotherapy**: Skipping radiotherapy might lower the risk of getting another cancer, especially certain types of leukemia. However, it's unclear how it affects overall survival.

2. **Size and Dose of Radiation**: Using smaller or weaker radiation didn’t show a clear difference in risk for other cancers or survival rates.

3. **Number of Chemotherapy Cycles**: Fewer cycles of chemotherapy seem to have little effect on cancer risk and survival.

4. **Stronger Chemotherapy**: More intense chemotherapy might increase the risk of some cancers but could improve the chance of staying cancer-free longer.

#### Safety and Effectiveness
- The study suggests careful consideration is needed to decide who should avoid radiotherapy after chemotherapy.
- More research is needed, especially on long-term effects.

#### Conclusion
Treatment should be personalized. While certain approaches seem to improve outcomes, they might have different risks. Further studies are necessary to understand long-term effects better."
"Background
Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) performed to treat patients with severe diffuse emphysema was reintroduced in the nineties. Lung volume reduction surgery aims to resect damaged emphysematous lung tissue, thereby increasing elastic properties of the lung. This treatment is hypothesised to improve long‐term daily functioning and quality of life, although it may be costly and may be associated with risks of morbidity and mortality. Ten years have passed since the last version of this review was prepared, prompting us to perform an update. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to gather all available evidence from randomised controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) versus non‐surgical standard therapy in improving health outcomes for patients with severe diffuse emphysema. Secondary objectives included determining which subgroup of patients benefit from LVRS and for which patients LVRS is contraindicated, to establish the postoperative complications of LVRS and its morbidity and mortality, to determine which surgical approaches for LVRS are most effective and to calculate the cost‐effectiveness of LVRS. 
Search methods
We identified RCTs by using the Cochrane Airways Group Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) register, in addition to the online clinical trials registers. Searches are current to April 2016. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs that studied the safety and efficacy of LVRS in participants with diffuse emphysema. We excluded studies that investigated giant or bullous emphysema. 
Data collection and analysis
Two independent review authors assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. When possible, we combined data from more than one study in a meta‐analysis using RevMan 5 software. 
Main results
We identified two new studies (89 participants) in this updated review. A total of 11 studies (1760 participants) met the entry criteria of the review, one of which accounted for 68% of recruited participants. The quality of evidence ranged from low to moderate owing to an unclear risk of bias across many studies, lack of blinding and low participant numbers for some outcomes. Eight of the studies compared LVRS versus standard medical care, one compared two closure techniques (stapling vs laser ablation), one looked at the effect of buttressing the staple line on the effectiveness of LVRS and one compared traditional 'resectional' LVRS with a non‐resectional surgical approach. Participants completed a mandatory course of pulmonary rehabilitation/physical training before the procedure commenced. Short‐term mortality was higher for LVRS (odds ratio (OR) 6.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.22 to 11.79; 1489 participants; five studies; moderate‐quality evidence) than for control, but long‐term mortality favoured LVRS (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.95; 1280 participants; two studies; moderate‐quality evidence). Participants identified post hoc as being at high risk of death from surgery were those with particularly impaired lung function, poor diffusing capacity and/or homogenous emphysema. Participants with upper lobe‐predominant emphysema and low baseline exercise capacity showed the most favourable outcomes related to mortality, as investigators reported no significant differences in early mortality between participants treated with LVRS and those in the control group (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.23 to 3.29; 290 participants; one study), as well as significantly lower mortality at the end of follow‐up for LVRS compared with control (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78; 290 participants; one study). Trials in this review furthermore provided evidence of low to moderate quality showing that improvements in lung function parameters other than forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), quality of life and exercise capacity were more likely with LVRS than with usual follow‐up. Adverse events were more common with LVRS than with control, specifically the occurrence of (persistent) air leaks, pulmonary morbidity (e.g. pneumonia) and cardiovascular morbidity. Although LVRS leads to an increase in quality‐adjusted life‐years (QALYs), the procedure is relatively costly overall. 
Authors' conclusions
Lung volume reduction surgery, an effective treatment for selected patients with severe emphysema, may lead to better health status and lung function outcomes, specifically for patients who have upper lobe‐predominant emphysema with low exercise capacity, but the procedure is associated with risks of early mortality and adverse events.","Lung volume reduction surgery for adults with diffuse emphysema
Review question 
Does lung volume reduction surgery improve lung function and quality of life, without leading to an increased chance of death, higher rates of illness after the procedure and higher costs for patients with severe emphysema, and which surgical methods lead to the best results in these patients? 
Background 
Emphysema causes severe damage to the lungs, which leads to breathing problems. Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) may help improve symptoms by removing the most diseased and non‐functioning parts of the lung. However, this procedure has been the centre of much controversy with its possible benefit being outweighed by potential harms and costs. 
Study characteristics 
This review examined the research published up to the 14th of April, 2016, and identified 11 studies involving 1760 participants. Eight of the studies compared LVRS versus standard medical care, one compared two closure techniques (stapling vs laser ablation), one looked at the effect of buttressing the staple line on the effectiveness of LVRS and one compared a traditional approach to LVRS with a 'non‐resectional' surgical approach. All participants completed a mandatory course of pulmonary rehabilitation/physical training before the procedure commenced. 
Key results 
This review found that people undergoing LVRS were at increased risk of death at three months after the procedure. By the end of follow‐up, death rates were lower for participants treated with LVRS than for those given standard medical care. Participants who were characterised by poor lung function with a particular distribution of diseased tissue in their lungs were at higher risk of death at three months and throughout one large study. One study identified a group of participants who responded better to LVRS than other participants, making them especially suitable for this treatment. The benefit of surgery for surviving participants was significant in terms of quality of life, exercise capacity and lung function, but costs of the procedure are relatively high, and patients had a greater chance of adverse events after the procedure. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the data reported is low to moderate in nature owing to some methodological issues of the trials (lack of blinding, unclear risk of bias). The results presented in this review are largely dominated by one influential study, which accounted for 68% of the participants.","# Plain Language Summary: Lung Volume Reduction Surgery for Emphysema

## What is this study about?

This review looked at research comparing lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) to regular medical treatment for people with severe emphysema. Emphysema is a lung disease that damages air sacs in the lungs, making it hard to breathe.

## What is lung volume reduction surgery?

LVRS is an operation where doctors remove the most damaged parts of the lungs. By removing this damaged tissue, the remaining healthy lung can work better and expand more easily.

## Who was studied?

The review included 11 studies with a total of 1,760 people who had severe emphysema. Before surgery, all participants completed a physical training program.

## What did researchers find?

**Short-term risks:** People who had surgery were more likely to die in the weeks right after the operation compared to people who received regular medical care.

**Long-term benefits:** Over time, people who had surgery lived longer than those who received regular medical care.

**Who benefited most:** People with emphysema mainly in the upper part of their lungs and lower exercise ability had the best results.

**Who had more problems:** People with very poor lung function or emphysema spread throughout both lungs had higher risks from surgery.

**Other improvements:** People who had surgery showed better lung function, quality of life, and exercise ability compared to regular care.

**Side effects:** Surgery patients experienced more complications, including air leaks from the lungs, infections, and heart problems.

**Cost:** While surgery improved health, it was expensive overall.

## Bottom line

LVRS can help selected patients with severe emphysema live longer and feel better, but it carries serious risks early on and requires careful patient selection.","### Plain Language Summary: Lung Volume Reduction Surgery for Severe Emphysema

**What Is the Study About?**

This study looks at how a surgery called Lung Volume Reduction Surgery (LVRS) helps people with serious lung problems due to emphysema. The surgery removes damaged parts of the lungs to help them work better. Researchers wanted to see if this surgery is better than regular non-surgical treatments and to learn more about its benefits and risks.

**Who Is Involved?**

The study gathered information from 11 different research trials with a total of 1,760 participants. These people had a type of lung disease called severe emphysema.

**What Did the Study Do?**

- Compared the outcomes of people who had the surgery with those who got usual medical treatments.
- Checked which patients benefited the most and who might have higher risks.
- Evaluated different surgical methods and costs of the surgery.

**What Were the Results?**

- Short-term risks: People who had the surgery had a higher chance of early death than those who did not have surgery.
- Long-term benefits: Over time, people who had the surgery lived longer on average.
- Best candidates: People with damaged upper parts of their lungs and low exercise ability saw the most improvement.
- Side effects: There were more side effects like air leaks, lung infections, and heart problems in surgery patients.
- Quality of life: Improvements in lung function, quality of life, and ability to exercise were more common after surgery.
- Costs: The surgery is expensive, but it can lead to better quality and longer life.

**Conclusion**

For some people with severe emphysema, LVRS can help improve lung function and quality of life. However, it does come with early risks and is quite costly. The best results were seen in patients with specific lung damage patterns."
"Background
This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 3, 2012. Caffeine has been added to common analgesics such as paracetamol, ibuprofen, and aspirin, in the belief that it enhances analgesic efficacy. Evidence to support this belief is limited and often based on invalid comparisons. 
Objectives
To assess the relative efficacy of a single dose of an analgesic plus caffeine against the same dose of the analgesic alone, without restriction on the analgesic used or the pain condition studied. We also assessed serious adverse events. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE from inception to 28 August 2014, the Oxford Pain Relief Database, and also carried out Internet searches and contacted pharmaceutical companies known to have carried out trials that have not been published. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised, double‐blind studies that compared a single dose of analgesic plus caffeine with the same dose of the analgesic alone in the treatment of acute pain. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and quality of studies, and extracted data. Any disagreements or uncertainties were settled by discussion with a third review author. We sought any validated measure of analgesic efficacy, but particularly the number of participants experiencing at least 50% of the maximum possible pain relief over four to six hours, participants reporting a global evaluation of treatment of very good or excellent, or headache relief after two hours. We pooled comparable data to look for a statistically significant difference, and calculated numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) with caffeine. We also looked for any numerical superiority associated with the addition of caffeine, and information about any serious adverse events. 
Main results
We identified no new studies with available results for this update. The earlier review included 20 studies (7238 participants) in valid comparisons, but because we used different outcomes for some headache studies, the number of participants in the analyses of the effects of caffeine is now 4262 when previously it was 5243. The studies were generally of good methodological quality, using standard designs and mostly standard scales of pain measurement, although many of those treating postoperative pain were small. 
Most studies used paracetamol or ibuprofen, with 100 mg to 130 mg caffeine, and the most common pain conditions studied were postoperative dental pain, postpartum pain, and headache. There was a small but statistically significant benefit with caffeine used at doses of 100 mg or more, which was not dependent on the pain condition or type of analgesic. About 5% to 10% more participants achieve a good level of pain relief (at least 50% of the maximum over four to six hours) with the addition of caffeine, giving a NNT of about 14 (high quality evidence). 
Most comparisons individually demonstrated numerical superiority with caffeine, but not statistical superiority. One serious adverse event was reported with caffeine, but was considered unrelated to any study medication. 
We know of the existence of around 25 additional studies with almost 12,500 participants for which data for analysis were not obtainable. The additional analgesic effect of caffeine remained statistically significant but clinically less important even if all the known missing data had no effect; the bulk of the unobtainable data are reported to have similar results as this review. 
Authors' conclusions
The addition of caffeine (≥ 100 mg) to a standard dose of commonly used analgesics provides a small but important increase in the proportion of participants who experience a good level of pain relief.","Caffeine as an analgesic adjuvant for acute pain in adults
Caffeine is found in various plant products, and may be ingested in drinks like tea, coffee, and some soft drinks and energy drinks. Caffeine is a stimulant, and can improve alertness and prevent tiredness over short periods. It may disturb sleep in some people if taken before bed. Ordinary consumption of caffeine (less than 500 milligrams daily) is not harmful to health. Caffeine is commonly used in pain‐relieving medicines available from pharmacies without a prescription. An adjuvant is something that is added to a medicine to make it work better. 
This review examined whether caffeine improves the pain‐relieving effects of such medicines. We searched for studies up to August 2014 and included twenty studies (7238 participants) examining several pain conditions, including headache, post‐dental pain, postoperative pain following childbirth, and menstrual period pain. The studies were generally of good methodological quality, using standard designs and mostly standard scales of pain measurement. Many of those in post‐dental and postoperative pain were small, and small studies can overestimate benefits. 
A dose of caffeine equivalent to a mug of coffee added to a standard dose of common analgesics such as paracetamol or ibuprofen provided better pain relief. Analgesic plus caffeine increased the number of people who had a good level of pain relief by 5% to 10% compared with analgesic alone (high quality evidence). 
No serious adverse events were reported that were related to either the analgesic or caffeine in these studies (low quality evidence). It is unlikely that adding caffeine to an analgesic will be harmful if the recommended dose is not exceeded.","# Plain Language Summary: Does Adding Caffeine to Pain Medicine Help?

## What is this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if adding caffeine to common pain medicines (like acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and aspirin) actually helps people feel better. Many pain medicines have caffeine added to them, but scientists weren't sure if this really works.

## Who did they study?

They looked at 20 research studies that included 4,262 people. These studies compared:
- Pain medicine **with** caffeine added
- The **same** pain medicine **without** caffeine

The studies looked at different types of pain, including pain after dental work, pain after childbirth, and headaches.

## What did they do?

Researchers searched medical databases and contacted pharmaceutical companies to find all available studies. They looked for high-quality studies where people didn't know if they were getting caffeine or not (called ""double-blind"" studies). Two researchers checked each study to make sure it was reliable.

## What did they find?

**The good news:** Adding caffeine (100-130 mg) to pain medicine **does help a little bit**. About 5-10% more people got good pain relief when caffeine was added.

**What that means:** For every 14 people taking pain medicine with caffeine, one extra person gets good pain relief compared to taking the medicine without caffeine.

**Safety:** Only one serious side effect was reported, and it wasn't thought to be caused by the caffeine.

## Bottom line

Adding caffeine to regular pain medicine provides a small but real improvement in pain relief. However, the benefit is modest.","### Plain Language Summary

**What was the study about?**

This study looked at whether adding caffeine to common pain relievers like paracetamol, ibuprofen, and aspirin helps them work better to relieve pain.

**Who was involved?**

The study reviewed data from over 7,000 people, looking specifically at results from combinations of pain relievers with caffeine versus pain relievers alone. The focus was on various types of pain like dental, postpartum, and headaches.

**What did they do?**

Researchers compared how effective a single dose of pain reliever plus caffeine was against the pain reliever alone. They looked at how many people felt at least 50% relief from their pain over four to six hours and if their overall treatment was good or excellent.

**What did they find?**

- Adding caffeine (100 mg or more) provided a small but real increase in the number of people who experienced good pain relief.
- About 5% to 10% more people got better pain relief with caffeine.
- Only one serious side effect was noted, but it wasn't connected to the studied medicines. 

**How long did the study last?**

The research involved studies up to August 28, 2014, with additional information dating back to a review started in 2012.

**Is it safe?**

The study found no major safety concerns related to adding caffeine. 

**Conclusion**

Adding caffeine can slightly improve the effectiveness of standard pain relievers for certain types of pain."
"Background
This is the second update of the review first published in the Cochrane Library (2010, Issue 2) and later updated (2014, Issue 9). 
Despite advances in chemotherapy, the prognosis of ovarian cancer remains poor. Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy aims to induce tumour antigen‐specific anti‐tumour immune responses as an alternative treatment for ovarian cancer. 
Objectives
Primary objective  • To assess the clinical efficacy of antigen‐specific active immunotherapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer as evaluated by tumour response measured by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) and/or cancer antigen (CA)‐125 levels, response to post‐immunotherapy treatment, and survival differences 
◦ In addition, we recorded the numbers of observed antigen‐specific humoral and cellular responses Secondary objective  • To establish which combinations of immunotherapeutic strategies with tumour antigens provide the best immunological and clinical results 
Search methods
For the previous version of this review, we performed a systematic search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2009, Issue 3), in the Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE and Embase databases, and clinicaltrials.gov (1966 to July 2009). We also conducted handsearches of the proceedings of relevant annual meetings (1996 to July 2009). 
For the first update of this review, we extended the searches to October 2013, and for this update, we extended the searches to July 2017. 
Selection criteria
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), as well as non‐randomised studies (NRSs), that included participants with epithelial ovarian cancer, irrespective of disease stage, who were treated with antigen‐specific active immunotherapy, irrespective of type of vaccine, antigen used, adjuvant used, route of vaccination, treatment schedule, and reported clinical or immunological outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviews authors independently extracted the data. We evaluated the risk of bias for RCTs according to standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane, and for NRSs by using a selection of quality domains deemed best applicable to the NRS. 
Main results
We included 67 studies (representing 3632 women with epithelial ovarian cancer). The most striking observations of this review address the lack of uniformity in conduct and reporting of early‐phase immunotherapy studies. Response definitions show substantial variation between trials, which makes comparison of trial results unreliable. Information on adverse events is frequently limited. Furthermore, reports of both RCTs and NRSs frequently lack the relevant information necessary for risk of bias assessment. Therefore, we cannot rule out serious biases in most of the included trials. However, selection, attrition, and selective reporting biases are likely to have affected the studies included in this review. GRADE ratings were high only for survival; for other primary outcomes, GRADE ratings were very low. 
The largest body of evidence is currently available for CA‐125‐targeted antibody therapy (17 studies, 2347 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Non‐randomised studies of CA‐125‐targeted antibody therapy suggest improved survival among humoral and/or cellular responders, with only moderate adverse events. However, four large randomised placebo‐controlled trials did not show any clinical benefit, despite induction of immune responses in approximately 60% of participants. Time to relapse with CA‐125 monoclonal antibody versus placebo, respectively, ranged from 10.3 to 18.9 months versus 10.3 to 13 months (six RCTs, 1882 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Only one RCT provided data on overall survival, reporting rates of 80% in both treatment and placebo groups (three RCTs, 1062 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Other small studies targeting many different tumour antigens have presented promising immunological results. As these strategies have not yet been tested in RCTs, no reliable inferences about clinical efficacy can be made. Given the promising immunological results and the limited side effects and toxicity reported, exploration of clinical efficacy in large well‐designed RCTs may be worthwhile. 
Authors' conclusions
We conclude that despite promising immunological responses, no clinically effective antigen‐specific active immunotherapy is yet available for ovarian cancer. Results should be interpreted cautiously, as review authors found a significant dearth of relevant information for assessment of risk of bias in both RCTs and NRSs.","Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy for ovarian cancer
Background  Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynaecological cancers. Standard therapy consists of surgery and chemotherapy. Responses to chemotherapy are generally good; however, most women experience relapse, for which no curative treatment is available. The presence of certain immune cells in tumours is associated with longer survival. This suggests that stimulation of anti‐tumour immune responses (i.e. immunotherapy) might be a useful approach for improving outcomes among women with ovarian cancer. 
Review question This review evaluated the feasibility of antigen‐specific active immunotherapy. Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy aims to induce anti‐tumour immune responses through administration of a tumour antigen ‐ a molecule that is expressed by tumour cells and is hardly expressed by healthy cells. Reviewers collected information on clinical outcomes, immunological responses, and side effects. 
Main findings We identified 67 studies, which included 3632 women with ovarian cancer and were published between 1966 and 2017. The most frequently described strategy was administration of antibodies targeting the tumour antigen CA‐125 (2347 participants in 17 studies). Most of these studies primarily evaluated safety and immunological responses. Severe flu‐like and gastrointestinal symptoms occurred in 7% to 30% of participants. Researchers frequently detected antibodies and immune cells recognising the tumour antigen CA‐125, albeit response rates varied between studies. Despite these promising immunological responses, four large studies reported no survival advantage for participants treated with CA‐125‐directed antibody over those given placebo. 
For strategies not relying on antibody administration, similar conclusions cannot yet be drawn. Overall, study authors report that treatment was well tolerated and inflammatory side effects at the injection site were most frequently observed. Researchers observed responses of the immune system for most strategies studied, but the clinical benefit of these strategies remains to be evaluated in large trials. 
Certainty of the evidence and conclusions Because no high‐certainty evidence of clinical benefit is currently available, antibody therapy targeting CA‐125 should not be incorporated into standard treatment in its current form. 
Based on lack of uniformity in included studies, we strongly advocate universal adoption of response definitions, guidelines for adverse events reporting, and directives for trial conduct and reporting. Furthermore, results from ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are awaited, and further RCTs should be conducted.","# Plain Language Summary: Immunotherapy for Ovarian Cancer

## What is this study about?

This review looked at research on a new type of cancer treatment called ""antigen-specific active immunotherapy"" (also called cancer vaccines) for ovarian cancer. Scientists wanted to see if these treatments help patients live longer and feel better.

## Why is this important?

Even with current cancer medicines, ovarian cancer is still very serious. These new vaccines work differently—they try to teach the body's immune system to fight cancer cells on its own.

## What did researchers do?

Experts searched for all studies testing these cancer vaccines from 1966 through July 2017. They looked at 67 different studies involving 3,632 women with ovarian cancer. They checked which treatments worked best and looked for side effects.

## What did they find?

**The main results:**
- Most studies were small and didn't follow the same rules, making it hard to compare results
- The most-tested vaccine targeted something called ""CA-125."" It caused immune responses in about 60% of patients
- However, large, well-designed studies showed this vaccine did **not** help patients live longer compared to fake treatment
- Patients lived about 10–19 months before cancer came back, whether they got the vaccine or not
- Other experimental vaccines showed promise in early tests but haven't been properly tested yet
- Side effects were generally mild

## Bottom line

Right now, **no cancer vaccine has been proven to work** for ovarian cancer. While these treatments show promise and seem safe, more large, carefully designed studies are needed before doctors can recommend them.","### Plain Language Summary

**Purpose of the Study**

This study looked at a new way to treat ovarian cancer using the body's immune system. Researchers wanted to see if this treatment could help fight cancer better than current options.

**Who Was Studied**

The study included 3,632 women with ovarian cancer. Doctors tested different immune treatments on these women to see how well they worked.

**What Was Done**

Doctors used a special immune treatment called antigen-specific immunotherapy. They tried different vaccines to help the body attack cancer cells. They measured results like tumor size and survival time.

**Main Findings**

- The study found no clear proof that the new treatment works better than current methods.
- Some treatments showed signs they might help the immune system, but they didn't improve survival rates.
- Researchers saw that many studies were done differently, making it hard to compare results.
- Side effects were generally moderate, but more information is needed.

**Safety and Results**

- The most information we have is about a treatment aimed at a specific cancer marker, CA-125. It helped some women's immune systems but didn’t make them live longer.
- High-quality studies showed no big difference in survival between women who got the treatment and those who didn’t.

**Conclusions**

While the new treatments showed some promise in helping the immune system, they didn't improve survival. More research is needed to see if these treatments can be more effective.

**Future Directions**

The study suggests further research should be done with bigger and better-planned trials to see if these treatments can be improved."
"Background
Portal hypertension commonly accompanies advanced liver disease and often gives rise to life‐threatening complications, including haemorrhage from oesophageal and gastrointestinal varices. Variceal haemorrhage commonly occurs in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. Therefore, prevention is important. 
Band ligation, beta‐blockers, and sclerotherapy have been proposed as alternatives for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children. However, primary prophylaxis is not the current standard of care in paediatric patients because it is unknown whether those treatments are of benefit or harm when used for primary prophylaxis in children and adolescents. 
Objectives
To determine the benefits and harms of beta‐blockers compared with placebo or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, LILACS, and Science Citation Index Expanded (April 2020). We screened the reference lists of the retrieved publications and manually searched the main paediatric gastroenterology and hepatology conference (NASPGHAN and ESPGHAN) abstract books from 2008 to December 2019. We searched clinicaltrials.gov, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the World Health Organization (WHO) for ongoing clinical trials. We imposed no language or document type restrictions on our search. 
Selection criteria
We planned to include randomised clinical trials, irrespective of blinding, language, or publication status to assess benefits and harms. We included observational studies, retrieved with the searches for randomised clinical trials, for a narrative report of harm. 
Data collection and analysis
We planned to summarise data from randomised clinical trials by standard Cochrane methodologies. We planned to asses risk of bias and use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Our primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events and liver‐related morbidity, and health‐related quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were oesophageal variceal bleeding and adverse events not considered serious. We planned to use intention‐to‐treat principle. We planned to analyse data with RevMan Analysis. 
Main results
We found no randomised clinical trials that assessed beta‐blockers compared with sham or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. We found four observational studies that reported on harms. As a systematic search for observational studies was not planned, we only listed the reported harms in a table. 
Authors' conclusions
Randomised clinical trials assessing the benefits or harms of beta‐blockers versus placebo or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis are lacking. Therefore, trials with adequate power and proper design, assessing the benefits and harms of beta‐blockers versus placebo on patient‐relevant clinical outcomes, such as mortality, quality of life, failure to control variceal bleeding, and adverse events are needed. Unless such trials are conducted and the results become published, we cannot make any conclusions regarding the benefits or harms of the two interventions.","Beta‐blockers versus placebo or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal varices in children 
Background 
Portal hypertension is defined as an increase in the blood pressure within a system of veins (a type of blood vessel) called the portal venous system. This system drains blood from the gastrointestinal tract (gut) and spleen into the liver. Portal hypertension commonly accompanies advanced liver disease and often gives rise to life‐threatening complications, including haemorrhage (bleeding) from oesophageal (gullet) and gastrointestinal varices (enlarged or swollen veins) in the tube that connects the throat and stomach (the oesophagus) and the digestive tract. Portal vein thrombosis (a vascular disease of the liver) occurs when a blood clot lodges in the hepatic portal vein. Portal vein thrombosis results in portal hypertension leading among others to the formation of varices (e.g. oesophageal or gastric). 
In adults, numerous randomised clinical trials (studies where people are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) have demonstrated benefits of medicines called non‐selective beta‐blockers in decreasing the risk of first variceal haemorrhage. These preventive interventions have become the established standard in adults. However, it is unknown whether the preventive interventions are of benefit or cause harm when used in children and adolescents. 
AimsWe aimed to assess the benefits and harms of beta‐blockers versus placebo or no intervention for the prevention of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. We searched for trials until April 2020. 
Key resultsWe found no randomised clinical trials to include in this systematic review. Therefore, we are unable to conclude whether beta‐blockers, when compared to placebo or no intervention, may be beneficial or not for children with oesophageal varices. There is a need for well‐designed and sufficiently large randomised clinical trials that include important clinical outcomes, such as death, quality of life, failure to control bleeding, and adverse events.","# Plain Language Summary: Beta-Blockers to Prevent Bleeding in Children with Liver Disease

## What is this study about?

This study looked for research on whether a type of medicine called beta-blockers can help prevent dangerous bleeding in children with liver disease.

## Why is this important?

When children have serious liver disease, blood vessels in their throat can become swollen and weak. These swollen vessels can burst and cause life-threatening bleeding. Doctors want to find ways to prevent this bleeding before it happens.

## What did researchers want to find out?

Researchers wanted to know if giving children beta-blocker medicine could stop this dangerous bleeding from happening. They also wanted to know if the medicine was safe and didn't cause other problems.

## What did they discover?

**The researchers found no studies that tested this.** They looked through many medical databases and conference records but could not find any proper research studies comparing beta-blockers to a placebo (fake medicine) or no treatment in children.

They did find four studies that reported on side effects, but these weren't the type of studies that could prove whether the medicine actually works.

## What does this mean?

Right now, doctors don't know if beta-blockers help prevent bleeding in children with liver disease. **We need real research studies to find out if this medicine is helpful and safe for kids.**

Until doctors have this information, they cannot recommend using beta-blockers to prevent bleeding in children with liver disease.","### Plain Language Summary

**Background**
Children with serious liver problems can have high blood pressure in a vein called the portal vein. This can lead to dangerous bleeding in the food pipe (esophagus). To prevent this bleeding, some doctors use treatments like banding, certain medicines (beta-blockers), or injections. However, it's not clear if these treatments help or harm children because there's not enough research.

**Objective**
The study aimed to find out if beta-blockers help prevent bleeding in children with liver problems compared to doing nothing or using a fake treatment.

**Research Methods**
Researchers looked through many scientific databases and conference records to find studies on this topic. They searched for all kinds of studies, including those in different languages, up until April 2020.

**Selection Criteria**
The researchers hoped to include studies that randomly assigned children to get either beta-blockers or no treatment. They also looked at other studies that weren't as strict to understand possible harms.

**Data Collection and Analysis**
The plan was to use standard methods to look at results from the studies. They wanted to focus on outcomes like death, serious health problems, and quality of life. They also planned to look at how well the treatments stopped bleeding and any side effects.

**Main Results**
The researchers didn’t find any studies that specifically tested beta-blockers against no treatment in children in the way they hoped. They did find four other studies that talked about harms, but since these weren’t the main studies they were looking for, they just listed them for now.

**Conclusion**
We still need good studies to see if beta-blockers really help children with liver problems without causing harm. Until we have these studies, we can't say if beta-blockers are good or bad for preventing bleeding in these children."
"Background
Commercially available preparations of garlic have been reported to have beneficial effects on some of the risk factors associated with atherosclerosis. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of garlic (both dried and non‐powdered preparations) for the treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease. 
Search methods
For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co‐ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched January 2013) and CENTRAL (2012, Issue 12). 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials of garlic therapy in patients with lower limb atherosclerosis were included. The main outcomes were objective measures of progression of underlying atherosclerosis (e.g. ankle pressure measurements, treadmill testing) and subjective measures (e.g. symptom progression). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (RJ and JK) independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. One author (RJ) contacted investigators to obtain information needed for the review that could not be found in published reports. 
Main results
One eligible trial with 78 participants was found. Both men and women (aged 40 to 75) were included. The follow‐up period was short, 12 weeks only. 
After twelve weeks of treatment, pain‐free walking distance increased from 161 to 207 metres in the group receiving garlic and from 172 to 203 metres in the placebo group. This was not a statistically significant difference. There was no difference in change of systolic or diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, ankle and brachial pressures. No severe side effects were observed and nine patients taking garlic (28%) and four patients taking placebo (12%) complained of a noticeable garlic smell. 
Three trials were excluded from the review because they did not include any clinical measurements. 
Authors' conclusions
One small trial of short duration found no statistically significant effect of garlic on walking distance.","Garlic for peripheral arterial occlusive disease affecting the legs
The most common symptom of peripheral arterial occlusive disease is intermittent claudication, discomfort in the legs that is triggered by exercise and relieved with rest. The underlying cause is atherosclerosis. Risk factors associated with the development of peripheral arterial disease include cigarette smoking, raised blood cholesterol and other fats (lipids), high blood pressure and diabetes. Garlic has been used as a medicinal therapy since ancient times. The main active ingredient is an unstable odorous sulphurous compound called allicin so that active ingredients may be lost in processing, and with different types of preparation. Commercially available preparations of garlic are reported to have beneficial effects on some of the risk factors for vascular disease. With fresh garlic, at least seven cloves of garlic per day are needed. Apart from the odour, garlic has only minor gastrointestinal side effects. 
The review authors made a thorough search of the medical literature and found one controlled trial in which 78 participants with peripheral arterial occlusive disease were randomised to receive garlic or a placebo medication. The dose of garlic was two coated tablets of 200 mg oral standardised garlic powder twice daily. Both men and women, aged 40 to 75 years, were included although sixteen did not keep to their treatment.   After twelve weeks of treatment, pain‐free walking distance increased similarly whether receiving garlic or placebo. Similarly there was no difference in the changes in blood pressure, heart rate and pressure differences between the ankle and brachial pressures. No severe side effects were observed although more people taking garlic (28%) than placebo (12%) complained of a noticeable garlic smell. Peripheral arterial occlusive disease is a long‐term (chronic) condition and any improvements in symptoms would require longer‐term treatment and follow up than in this study.","# Plain Language Summary: Garlic for Leg Blood Vessel Problems

## What is this study about?
Researchers wanted to test whether garlic could help people with poor blood flow in their legs. Some studies suggested garlic might be helpful, so they looked for all the research that tested this idea.

## Who was involved?
The researchers found one study that included 78 people (both men and women) between ages 40 and 75 who had leg blood vessel problems.

## What did they test?
The study compared:
- **Garlic group**: People who took garlic for 12 weeks
- **Placebo group**: People who took a fake pill for 12 weeks (they didn't know it wasn't real garlic)

## What were they measuring?
The main thing researchers checked was how far people could walk without pain. They also measured blood pressure, heart rate, and blood vessel pressure in the legs and arms.

## What happened?
After 12 weeks:
- **Garlic group**: Could walk about 46 meters farther before pain started (from 161 to 207 meters)
- **Placebo group**: Could walk about 31 meters farther (from 172 to 203 meters)

The difference between the two groups was **not big enough to matter**.

Blood pressure, heart rate, and other measurements were the same in both groups.

## Side effects
No serious problems happened. However, 9 people taking garlic (28%) and 4 people taking placebo (12%) noticed a garlic smell.

## Bottom line
This small, short study found that garlic did **not** help people with leg blood vessel problems walk farther without pain.","**Plain Language Summary**

**Study Purpose:**  
This study looked at how garlic might help people with a condition that affects blood flow in the legs.

**Who Participated:**  
78 men and women, aged 40 to 75, took part in the study.

**What They Did:**  
Participants were divided into two groups. One group took garlic, and the other took a placebo (a fake treatment) for 12 weeks. Researchers measured how far people could walk without pain and checked blood pressure and heart rates.

**What They Found:**  
- People who took garlic could walk a bit farther without pain, but the difference was not significant compared to the placebo group.
- No big changes were found in blood pressure or heart rates for either group.
- Some people reported a garlic smell as a side effect, but there were no serious side effects.

**Conclusion:**  
The study didn’t find strong evidence that garlic helps improve walking distance for people with this condition."
"Background
Approximately 20% of stroke patients experience clinically significant levels of anxiety at some point after stroke. Physicians can treat these patients with antidepressants or other anxiety‐reducing drugs, or both, or they can provide psychological therapy. This review looks at available evidence for these interventions. This is an update of the review first published in October 2011. 
Objectives
The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness of pharmaceutical, psychological, complementary, or alternative therapeutic interventions in treating stroke patients with anxiety disorders or symptoms. The secondary objective was to identify whether any of these interventions for anxiety had an effect on quality of life, disability, depression, social participation, caregiver burden, or risk of death. 
Search methods
We searched the trials register of the Cochrane Stroke Group (January 2017). We also searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library; 2017, Issue 1: searched January 2017); MEDLINE (1966 to January 2017) in Ovid; Embase (1980 to January 2017) in Ovid; the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1937 to January 2017) in EBSCO; and PsycINFO (1800 to January 2017) in Ovid. We conducted backward citation searches of reviews identified through database searches and forward citation searches of included studies. We contacted researchers known to be involved in related trials, and we searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised trials including participants with a diagnosis of both stroke and anxiety for which treatment was intended to reduce anxiety. Two review authors independently screened and selected titles and abstracts for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We performed a narrative review. We planned to do a meta‐analysis but were unable to do so as included studies were not sufficiently comparable. 
Main results
We included three trials (four interventions) involving 196 participants with stroke and co‐morbid anxiety. One trial (described as a 'pilot study') randomised 21 community‐dwelling stroke survivors to four‐week use of a relaxation CD or to wait list control. This trial assessed anxiety using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and reported a reduction in anxiety at three months among participants who had used the relaxation CD (mean (standard deviation (SD) 6.9 (± 4.9) and 11.0 (± 3.9)), Cohen's d = 0.926, P value = 0.001; 19 participants analysed). 
The second trial randomised 81 participants with co‐morbid anxiety and depression to paroxetine, paroxetine plus psychotherapy, or standard care. Mean levels of anxiety severity scores based on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM‐A) at follow‐up were 5.4 (SD ± 1.7), 3.8 (SD ± 1.8), and 12.8 (SD ± 1.9), respectively (P value < 0.01). 
The third trial randomised 94 stroke patients, also with co‐morbid anxiety and depression, to receive buspirone hydrochloride or standard care. At follow‐up, the mean levels of anxiety based on the HAM‐A were 6.5 (SD ± 3.1) and 12.6 (SD ± 3.4) in the two groups, respectively, which represents a significant difference (P value < 0.01). Half of the participants receiving paroxetine experienced adverse events that included nausea, vomiting, or dizziness; however, only 14% of those receiving buspirone experienced nausea or palpitations. Trial authors provided no information about the duration of symptoms associated with adverse events. The trial of relaxation therapy reported no adverse events. 
The quality of the evidence was very low. Each study included a small number of participants, particularly the study of relaxation therapy. Studies of pharmacological agents presented details too limited to allow judgement of selection, performance, and detection bias and lack of placebo treatment in control groups. Although the study of relaxation therapy had allocated participants to treatment using an adequate method of randomisation, study recruitment methods might have introduced bias, and drop‐outs in the intervention group may have influenced results. 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence is insufficient to guide the treatment of anxiety after stroke. Further well‐conducted randomised controlled trials (using placebo or attention controls) are required to assess pharmacological agents and psychological therapies.","Interventions for treating anxiety after stroke
Review question 
To determine whether any treatments might reduce the symptoms of anxiety, and subsequently improve quality of life, for people who have had a stroke. 
Background 
Anxiety after stroke occurs frequently and can be treated with antidepressants or other anxiety‐reducing drugs, or both, or with psychological therapy. 
Study characteristics 
Evidence is current to January 2017. We found three studies with 196 stroke survivors who had received a diagnosis of anxiety. One study assessed the effect of a relaxation CD used five times a week for one month for participants with a diagnosis of anxiety. Two studies assessed the use of antidepressants in participants who had both anxiety and depression. 
Key results 
One study found that participants were less anxious three months after using a relaxation CD when compared with those who were given no therapy. One study reported that participants were less anxious when treated with an antidepressant medicine (paroxetine), or with paroxetine and psychotherapy, than with standard care. This study reported that half of the participants receiving paroxetine experienced side effects that included nausea, vomiting, or dizziness. The third study also reported that participants were less anxious when treated with an antidepressant (buspirone hydrochloride) than with standard care, and only 14% of those receiving buspirone hydrocholoride reported nausea or palpitations. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged that the quality of this evidence was very low. Studies were few and each included a small number of participants. Studies assessing antidepressants did not include comparison with a placebo drug, and information in both study reports was insufficient to permit assessment of whether other biases had been introduced. The study of relaxation therapy was very small, with loss of two participants who used the CD, and the study recruitment process may have attracted participants who had a positive bias towards psychological therapies. 
Conclusion 
Current evidence is insufficient to guide the treatment of anxiety after stroke. Additional well‐conducted randomised trials are needed.","# Plain Language Summary: Treating Anxiety After Stroke

## What is this study about?

About 1 in 5 stroke patients feel very anxious after their stroke. Doctors can treat this anxiety with medicines, therapy, or both. This review looked at studies testing different ways to help stroke patients with anxiety.

## Who was studied?

The review included three small studies with a total of 196 stroke patients who also had anxiety.

## What treatments were tested?

**Study 1:** 21 patients listened to a relaxation CD for four weeks or were put on a waiting list.

**Study 2:** 81 patients received either:
- A medicine called paroxetine
- Paroxetine plus therapy sessions
- Regular care (no special treatment)

**Study 3:** 94 patients received either:
- A medicine called buspirone
- Regular care (no special treatment)

## What were the results?

All three treatments helped reduce anxiety compared to regular care:
- The relaxation CD worked well
- Paroxetine alone helped
- Paroxetine plus therapy worked best
- Buspirone helped

## Were there side effects?

- Relaxation CD: No side effects reported
- Paroxetine: About half of patients had nausea, vomiting, or dizziness
- Buspirone: Only 14% had mild side effects like nausea

## Bottom line

The studies were small and not very strong. We need bigger, better-designed studies to know for sure which treatment works best for anxiety after stroke.","**Summary of Clinical Trial on Treating Anxiety in Stroke Patients**

**Why This Study?**
Many people who have had a stroke also experience anxiety. Doctors can treat anxiety with medication or therapy. This study looks at how well these treatments work.

**What Was the Study About?**
The main goal was to see how well medicines, therapy, and other treatments work for anxiety in people who had a stroke. The study also checked if these treatments helped with quality of life, depression, or social activities.

**How Was the Study Done?**
Researchers looked at many previous studies and chose ones with people who had both stroke and anxiety. They found three important trials with a total of 196 people.

**What Did They Find?**
1. **Relaxation CDs:** One small study tested a relaxation CD for four weeks. People who used it felt less anxious three months later. There were no side effects reported.

2. **Paroxetine (an antidepressant):** Another study gave some people paroxetine alone, some with therapy, and some just regular care. Those taking paroxetine (with or without therapy) had lower anxiety levels, but half experienced side effects like nausea and dizziness.

3. **Buspirone (for anxiety):** A third study compared buspirone to standard care. Those on buspirone had reduced anxiety but some experienced minor side effects like nausea.

**Any Problems with the Study?**
- The evidence quality was low because the studies were small.
- Some studies didn’t use placebos (fake treatments for comparison).
- There might have been some errors in how the studies were done.

**Conclusion**
We need more research to understand how best to treat anxiety in stroke patients. Future studies should use better methods and include more participants."
"Background
Pyrethroid long‐lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have been important in the large reductions in malaria cases in Africa, but insecticide resistance in Anopheles mosquitoes threatens their impact. Insecticide synergists may help control insecticide‐resistant populations. Piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is such a synergist; it has been incorporated into pyrethroid‐LLINs to form pyrethroid‐PBO nets, which are currently produced by five LLIN manufacturers and, following a recommendation from the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2017, are being included in distribution campaigns. This review examines epidemiological and entomological evidence on the addition of PBO to pyrethroid nets on their efficacy. 
Objectives
To compare effects of pyrethroid‐PBO nets currently in commercial development or on the market with effects of their non‐PBO equivalent in relation to: 
1. malaria parasite infection (prevalence or incidence); and2. entomological outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group (CIDG) Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CAB Abstracts, and two clinical trial registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) up to 25 September 2020. We contacted organizations for unpublished data. We checked the reference lists of trials identified by these methods. 
Selection criteria
We included experimental hut trials, village trials, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with mosquitoes from the Anopheles gambiae complex or the Anopheles funestus group. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed each trial for eligibility, extracted data, and determined the risk of bias for included trials. We resolved disagreements through discussion with a third review author. We analysed data using Review Manager 5 and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Sixteen trials met the inclusion criteria: 10 experimental hut trials, four village trials, and two cluster‐RCTs (cRCTs). Three trials are awaiting classification, and four trials are ongoing.  
Two cRCTs examined the effects of pyrethroid‐PBO nets on parasite prevalence in people living in areas with highly pyrethroid‐resistant mosquitoes (< 30% mosquito mortality in discriminating dose assays). At 21 to 25 months post intervention, parasite prevalence was lower in the intervention arm (odds ratio (OR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 0.95; 2 trials, 2 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
In highly pyrethroid‐resistant areas, unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets led to higher mosquito mortality compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs (risk ratio (RR) 1.84, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.11; 14,620 mosquitoes, 5 trials, 9 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence) and lower blood feeding success (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.71; 14,000 mosquitoes, 4 trials, 8 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence). However, in comparisons of washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets to washed LLINs, we do not know if PBO nets had a greater effect on mosquito mortality (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.63; 10,268 mosquitoes, 4 trials, 5 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence), although the washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets did decrease blood‐feeding success compared to standard‐LLINs (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.92; 9674 mosquitoes, 3 trials, 4 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence). 
In areas where pyrethroid resistance is moderate (31% to 60% mosquito mortality), mosquito mortality was higher with unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.11; 1007 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence), but there was little to no difference in effects on blood‐feeding success (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.11; 1006 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence). For washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to washed standard‐LLINs, we found little to no evidence for higher mosquito mortality or reduced blood feeding (mortality: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.54; 329 mosquitoes, 1 trial, 1 comparison, low‐certainty evidence; blood feeding success: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.13; 329 mosquitoes, 1 trial, 1 comparison; low‐certainty evidence). 
In areas where pyrethroid resistance is low (61% to 90% mosquito mortality), studies reported little to no difference in the effects of unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs on mosquito mortality (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.57; 1580 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence), and we do not know if there was any effect on blood‐feeding success (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.11; 1580 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence). For washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to washed standard‐LLINs, we do not know if there was any difference in mosquito mortality (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.04; 1774 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence) or on blood feeding (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.33; 1774 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). 
In areas where mosquito populations are susceptible to insecticides (> 90% mosquito mortality), there may be little to no difference in the effects of unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs on mosquito mortality (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.26; 2791 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). This is similar for washed nets (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.25; 2644 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). We do not know if unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets had any effect on the blood‐feeding success of susceptible mosquitoes (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.22; 2791 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence). The same applies to washed nets (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.91; 2644 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). 
In village trials comparing pyrethroid‐PBO nets to LLINs, there was no difference in sporozoite rate (4 trials, 5 comparisons) nor in mosquito parity (3 trials, 4 comparisons). 
Authors' conclusions
In areas of high insecticide resistance, pyrethroid‐PBO nets have greater entomological and epidemiological efficacy compared to standard LLINs, with sustained reduction in parasite prevalence, higher mosquito mortality and reduction in mosquito blood feeding rates 21 to 25 months post intervention. Questions remain about the durability of PBO on nets, as the impact of pyrethroid‐PBO nets on mosquito mortality was not sustained over 20 washes in experimental hut trials, and epidemiological data on pyrethroid‐PBO nets for the full intended three‐year life span of the nets is not available. Little evidence is available to support greater entomological efficacy of pyrethroid‐PBO nets in areas where mosquitoes show lower levels of resistance to pyrethroids.","Pyrethroid‐PBO nets to prevent malaria
Background 
Bed nets treated with pyrethroid insecticides are an effective way to reduce malaria transmission and have been deployed across Africa. However, mosquitoes that spread malaria are now developing resistance to this type of insecticide. One way to overcome this resistance is to add another chemical ‐ piperonyl butoxide (PBO) ‐ to the net. PBO is not an insecticide, but it blocks the substance (an enzyme) inside the mosquito that stops pyrethroids from working. 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if pyrethroid‐PBO nets provide additional protection against malaria when compared to standard pyrethroid‐only nets. 
Key messages 
Pyrethroid‐PBO nets were more effective than standard pyrethroid‐only nets in killing mosquitoes and preventing blood feeding in areas where mosquito populations are very resistant to pyrethroid insecticides (high‐certainty evidence). Pyrethroid‐PBO nets reduced the number of malaria infections in areas of high pyrethroid resistance (moderate‐certainty evidence), although further studies are needed to measure clinical outcomes for the full lifetime of the net. 
What was studied in the review? 
We included 16 trials conducted between 2010 and 2020 that compared standard pyrethroid nets to pyrethroid‐PBO nets. These consisted of 10 experimental hut trials that measured the impact of pyrethroid‐PBO nets on a wild population of mosquitoes, four village trials, and two cRCTs. The two cRCTs measured the impact of pyrethroid‐PBO nets on malaria infection in humans; all other studies recorded their impact on mosquito populations. We analysed hut and village studies to determine whether pyrethroid‐PBO nets were better for killing mosquitoes and preventing them from blood feeding. For both cRCT trials, we examined whether pyrethroid‐PBO nets reduced the number of malaria infections. As the benefit of adding PBO to nets is likely to depend on the level of pyrethroid resistance in the mosquito population, we performed separate analyses for studies conducted in areas of high, medium, and low levels of pyrethroid resistance. 
What are the main results of the review? 
When mosquitoes show high levels of resistance to pyrethroids, pyrethroid‐PBO nets perform better than standard pyrethroid‐only nets for killing mosquitoes and preventing them from blood feeding. As expected, this effect is not seen in areas where mosquitoes show low or no resistance to pyrethroid‐only insecticides. Two trials looked at the impact of using pyrethroid‐PBO nets on the number of people infected with the malaria parasite. These trials, involving 10,603 participants in total and conducted in an area where mosquitoes are very resistant to pyrethroids, found that fewer people were infected with malaria when the population used pyrethroid‐PBO nets than when standard pyrethroid‐only nets were used.

## What is this study about?

Scientists wanted to know if special mosquito nets work better than regular nets at preventing malaria in areas where mosquitoes have become resistant to insecticides (poisons used to kill mosquitoes).

## The Problem

Regular insecticide-treated nets have helped reduce malaria cases in Africa. However, some mosquitoes have developed resistance—meaning the poison doesn't kill them as well anymore. Researchers added a special ingredient called PBO to these nets to see if it would help kill resistant mosquitoes better.

## What the researchers did

Scientists reviewed 16 studies that tested these special PBO nets compared to regular nets. The studies looked at:
- How many people got malaria
- How many mosquitoes died
- How many mosquitoes were able to bite and feed on blood

## Main findings

**In areas with very resistant mosquitoes:**
- People using PBO nets had fewer malaria infections
- More mosquitoes died when exposed to unwashed PBO nets
- Fewer mosquitoes were able to bite people

**In areas with some resistant mosquitoes:**
- PBO nets killed more mosquitoes than regular nets (when unwashed)
- Results were less clear when nets were washed

**In areas with low resistance or no resistance:**
- PBO nets didn't work much better than regular nets

## Important limitation

The special ingredient (PBO) on the nets wore off after about 20 washes. Scientists don't have enough information about how well these nets work for their full 3-year lifespan.

## Bottom line

PBO nets work better than regular nets in areas where mosquitoes are highly resistant to poison, but their effectiveness decreases as the nets are washed and used over time.","### Simple Summary of the Clinical Trial Review on Pyrethroid-PBO Nets

**Purpose of the Study:**
This study looks at special mosquito nets called pyrethroid-PBO nets to see if they are better at protecting people from malaria compared to regular mosquito nets. These nets may help because some mosquitoes have become resistant to the insecticides used in older nets.

**Who is Involved:**
The study included different trials with mosquitoes that can spread malaria. These trials took place in huts, villages, and larger community settings.

**Methods:**
Researchers checked different scientific databases for studies conducted up to September 2020. They included trials that tested the effectiveness of the nets.

**What They Found:**
- In areas where mosquitoes are very resistant to insecticides, the pyrethroid-PBO nets worked better. They lowered the number of people with the malaria parasite and killed more mosquitoes. 
- In these areas, mosquitoes were also less likely to feed on people when using these nets.
- When the nets were washed, their effectiveness decreased, but they still reduced the mosquitoes' ability to feed compared to regular nets.
- In areas with less resistant mosquitoes, the new nets didn't show a big difference in their effectiveness compared to regular nets.

**Timeframe and Safety:**
The nets worked well for up to 21 to 25 months. However, it's unclear if the nets last effectively for their full intended lifespan of three years.

**Conclusions:**
Pyrethroid-PBO nets seem to work better than regular nets in areas with highly resistant mosquitoes. More research is needed to see how long they stay effective, especially after washing.

This summary helps people understand how adding PBO to mosquito nets could improve protection against malaria, depending on mosquito resistance levels in different areas."
"Background
Corticosteroids are commonly used for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. However, traditional corticosteroids can cause significant adverse events. Budesonide is an alternative glucocorticoid with limited systemic bioavailability. 
Objectives
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral budesonide for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. 
Search methods
The following electronic databases were searched up to June 2014: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Specialised Trial Register, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Reference lists of articles, as well as conference proceedings were manually searched. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing budesonide to a placebo or active comparator were considered for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. Meta‐analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3.5 software. The primary outcome was induction of remission (defined by a Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) < 150) by week 8 to 16 of treatment. Secondary outcomes included: time to remission, mean change in CDAI, clinical, histological or endoscopic improvement, improvement in quality of life, adverse events and early withdrawal. We calculated the relative risk (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each dichotomous outcome and the mean difference and corresponding 95% CI for each continuous outcome. Data were analyzed on an intention‐to‐treat basis. A random‐effects model was used for the pooled analyses. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcomes and selected secondary outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. 
Main results
Fourteen studies (1805 patients) were included: Nine (779 patients) compared budesonide to conventional corticosteroids, three (535 patients) were placebo‐controlled, and two (491 patients) compared budesonide to mesalamine. Ten studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. Three studies were judged to be at high risk of bias due to open label design. One study was judged to be at high risk of bias due to selective reporting. After eight weeks of treatment, 9 mg budesonide was significantly more effective than placebo for induction of clinical remission. Forty‐seven per cent (115/246) of budesonide patients achieved remission at 8 weeks compared to 22% (29/133) of placebo patients (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.73; 3 studies, 379 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was moderate due to sparse data (144 events). Budesonide was significantly less effective than conventional steroids for induction of remission at eight weeks. Fifty‐two per cent of budesonide patients achieved remission at week 8 compared to 61% of patients who received conventional steroids (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.97; 8 studies, 750 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was moderate due to risk of bias. Budesonide was significantly less effective than conventional steroids among patients with severe disease (CDAI > 300) (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.95). Studies comparing budesonide to mesalamine were not pooled due to heterogeneity (I2 = 81%). One study (n = 182) found budesonide to be superior to mesalamine for induction of remission at 8 weeks. Sixty‐eight per cent (63/93) of budesonide patients were in remission at 8 weeks compared to 42% (37/89) of mesalamine patients (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.16). The other study found no statistically significant difference in remission rates at eight weeks. Sixty‐nine per cent (107/154) of budesonide patients were in remission at 8 weeks compared to 62% (132/242) of mesalamine patients (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.32). Fewer adverse events occurred in those treated with budesonide compared to conventional steroids (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.76) and budesonide was better than conventional steroids in preserving adrenal function (RR for abnormal ACTH test 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.78). 
Authors' conclusions
Budesonide is more effective than placebo for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Although short‐term efficacy with budesonide is less than with conventional steroids, particularly in those with severe disease or more extensive colonic involvement, the likelihood of adverse events and adrenal suppression with budesonide is lower. The current evidence does not allow for a firm conclusion on the relative efficacy of budesonide compared to 5‐ASA products.","Budesonide for treatment of people with active Crohn's disease.
What is Crohn's disease?  Crohn's disease is a debilitating long‐term (chronic) inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. Symptoms include abdominal pain, non‐bloody diarrhea and weight loss. The most common initial treatment of the Crohn's disease is oral steroid therapy. Unfortunately, traditional steroids are usually absorbed into the body and cause significant unwanted side effects. These may include but are not limited to weight gain, diabetes, growth retardation, acne, mood instability, and high blood pressure. When people with Crohn's disease are experiencing symptoms of the disease it is said to be ‘active’; periods when the symptoms stop are called ‘remission’. 
What is budesonide?  Budesonide is a steroid that is quickly metabolized by the liver thereby reducing corticosteroid‐related side effects. 
What did the researchers investigate?  The researchers investigated whether budesonide produces remission in people with active Crohn's disease; and whether these medications cause any harms (side effects). The researchers searched the medical literature up to June 12, 2014. 
What did the researchers find?  The researchers identified 14 studies that included a total of 1805 participants. Nine studies (779 participants) compared budesonide to conventional corticosteroids, three studies (535 participants) compared budesonide to a placebo (e.g. a sugar pill), and two studies (491 participants) compared budesonide to mesalamine (an anti‐inflammatory drug composed of 5‐aminosalicylic acid). Ten studies were judged to be of high quality. Four studies were judged to be of low quality. 
Budesonide was superior to placebo for induction of remission. An increase in side effects was not seen with budesonide compared to placebo. Withdrawals due to disease worsening were similar in budesonide and placebo groups. Budesonide patients were more likely than placebo patients to experience adrenal suppression a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce adequate amounts of steroid hormones. 
Budesonide was significantly less effective than conventional steroids for induction of remission in people with Crohn's disease. However, fewer side effects occurred in those treated with budesonide compared to conventional steroids and budesonide was better than conventional steroids in preserving adrenal function. 
One study (n = 182) found budesonide to be superior to mesalamine for induction of remission in patients with Crohn's disease whereas another study found no difference in remission rates. 
The current evidence does not allow for a firm conclusion on the relative efficacy of budesonide compared to 5‐aminosalicylic products. Budesonide is more effective than placebo for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Although budesonide is less effective than conventional steroids for induction of remission the likelihood of side effects and adrenal suppression is lower than with conventional steroids.","# Plain Language Summary: Budesonide for Crohn's Disease

## What is this study about?

This study looked at whether a medicine called budesonide works well to help people with Crohn's disease feel better. Researchers wanted to compare budesonide to other treatments and see which one is safest and most effective.

## Why does this matter?

Doctors often use strong steroids to treat Crohn's disease, but these medicines can cause serious side effects. Budesonide is a different type of steroid that might cause fewer problems.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at 14 studies involving 1,805 patients. They compared:
- Budesonide vs. placebo (fake medicine)
- Budesonide vs. regular steroids
- Budesonide vs. another medicine called mesalamine

They checked if patients got better within 8 weeks of treatment.

## What did they find?

**Budesonide vs. placebo:** Budesonide worked better. About 47% of people taking budesonide felt better compared to 22% taking placebo.

**Budesonide vs. regular steroids:** Regular steroids worked slightly better (61% vs. 52% felt better). However, budesonide caused fewer side effects and was gentler on the body's hormone system.

**Budesonide vs. mesalamine:** Results were mixed—one study showed budesonide worked better, but another study showed similar results for both medicines.

## Bottom line

Budesonide is better than placebo and causes fewer side effects than regular steroids. However, regular steroids may work slightly better, especially for people with severe disease. More research is needed to compare budesonide with mesalamine.","### Plain Language Summary

**What Was Studied?**

Researchers wanted to see if a medicine called budesonide is safe and works well to help calm down Crohn's disease symptoms. They compared it to other treatments like fake medicine (placebo), regular steroids, and mesalamine.

**Who Was Involved?**

The study looked at 1,805 people who have Crohn's disease.

**What Treatments Were Compared?**

1. Budesonide
2. Placebo (a fake pill with no medicine)
3. Regular steroids
4. Mesalamine (another type of medication)

**How Was the Study Done?**

Scientists looked at 14 different studies. They checked how well people got better by using budesonide compared to the other treatments.

**What Did They Find?**

- Budesonide helped more people feel better than the placebo after 8 weeks. About 47% of budesonide users got better, compared to 22% with the placebo.
- Budesonide was not as strong as regular steroids, especially for people with more severe symptoms. 52% of people on budesonide improved, while 61% of those on regular steroids got better.
- Compared to mesalamine, one study showed budesonide worked better, but another study showed no big difference between the two.

**Safety and Side Effects**

- Budesonide had fewer side effects than regular steroids. It was also easier on the adrenal glands, which help manage stress and other body functions.

**Conclusion**

Budesonide works better than a fake pill, but not as well as regular steroids, especially for more severe cases. It has fewer side effects than regular steroids. More research is needed to compare budesonide and mesalamine effectively."
"Background
Endometrial cancer is one of the most common gynaecological cancers in developed countries. Treatment of advanced endometrial cancer usually involves radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy or a combination of these. However, survival outcomes are poor in advanced or metastatic disease. Better systemic treatment options are needed to improve survival and safety outcomes for these women. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is a frequently altered signalling pathway in endometrial cancer. Single‐arm studies have reported some encouraging results of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibition in advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor‐containing regimens in women with locally‐advanced, metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and Embase to 16 January 2019; and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov in July 2018. We also reviewed reference lists from included studies and endometrial cancer guidelines. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a regimen with a PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor (either alone or in combination with other treatments, such as chemotherapy or hormonal therapy) versus a comparator regimen without a PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor. There were no restrictions on which comparator(s) were included. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data independently, and assessed risks of bias and the certainty of the evidence. The primary outcome measures were progression‐free survival and toxicity (grade 3/4 where available). We derived hazard ratios (HRs) for time‐to‐event outcomes and risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes. Secondary outcomes included overall survival, objective tumour response rate, quality of life and treatment‐related death. We used GRADEproGDT to assess the certainty of the evidence for the most important outcomes (by first‐line and second/third‐line therapy for progression‐free survival and overall survival). 
Main results
We included two RCTs involving 361 women. One study assessed the effects of the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus, in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel versus carboplatin/paclitaxel and bevacizumab in treatment‐naïve women with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. The second study compared the mTOR inhibitor ridaforolimus alone versus progestin or investigator choice of chemotherapy in women who had received prior treatment for metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer. We identified five ongoing studies on the effects of PI3K and AKT inhibitors, metformin and dual mTOR inhibitors. 
For first‐line therapy, an mTOR inhibitor‐containing regimen may worsen progression‐free survival (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.93; 1 study, 231 participants; low‐certainty evidence), while for second/third‐line therapy, an mTOR inhibitor probably improves progression‐free survival compared to chemotherapy or endocrine therapy (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.91; 1 study, 95 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Data on toxicity were available from both studies: administering an mTOR inhibitor regimen may increase the risk of grade 3/4 mucositis (RR 10.42, 95% CI 1.34 to 80.74; 2 studies, 357 participants; low‐certainty evidence), but may result in little to no difference in risk of anaemia or interstitial pneumonitis (low‐certainty evidence for both toxicities). Overall, event rates were low. For first‐line therapy, an mTOR inhibitor‐containing regimen may result in little to no difference in overall survival compared to chemotherapy (HR 1.32, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.781 study, 231 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The finding was similar for second/third‐line therapy (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.61; 1 study, 130 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Administering mTOR inhibitor‐containing regimens may result in little to no difference in tumour response compared to chemotherapy or hormonal therapy in first‐line or second/third‐line therapy (first line: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.17; 1 study, 231 participants; second/third line: RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.40; 1 study, 61 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Neither study collected or reported quality‐of‐life data.
Authors' conclusions
Two RCTs have been reported to date, with low certainty of evidence. In a recurrent disease setting, mTOR inhibitors may result in improved progression‐free survival, but we found no clear benefit in overall survival or tumour response rate. We await the publication of at least five ongoing studies investigating the role of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors in advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer before any conclusions can be drawn on their use.","Drugs targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway for locally‐advanced, metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer 
What is the aim of this review? To find out whether drugs that inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (known as PI3K, AKT and mTOR inhibitors) can improve survival of women diagnosed with locally‐advanced (cancer that has spread beyond the uterus/womb), metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer. 
Key messages There is a low certainty of evidence from two clinical trials about the use of drugs targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in women with locally‐advanced, metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer. Based on the small number of completed studies, women who have received prior treatment for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer and received an mTOR inhibitor may have a lower risk of their cancer progressing compared to those who received chemotherapy/hormonal therapy alone. However, in women who received mTOR inhibitor‐containing chemotherapy as part of their treatment when first diagnosed with advanced disease, mTOR inhibitor‐containing treatment may result in their disease progressing more quickly and probably with increased complications compared to chemotherapy or hormonal therapy alone. Although mTOR inhibitors may change how long it takes for their cancer to progress, there may be little or no difference in how long women lived after treatment (known as overall survival). We await the publication of at least five studies examining the role of PI3K, AKT and mTOR inhibitors in advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. 
What was studied in the review? Treatment for women with metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer usually involves radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy or a combination of these to try to shrink or slow the growth of the cancer. The response of the cancer to these treatments is variable, but mostly modest. New treatments are needed to improve outcomes. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway within an endometrial cancer cell is involved in the growth of endometrial cancer, and various drugs have been developed to target this pathway with the aim of reducing the growth of endometrial cancer cells. These are known as PI3K, AKT and mTOR inhibitors. We found relevant studies looking at mTOR inhibitors. mTOR inhibitors can be given alone or in combination with other cancer treatment drugs. They may be given along with chemotherapy or endocrine therapy. mTOR inhibitors act by blocking cancer cells from dividing and reproducing. Their adverse events can include ulcers along the digestive tract (known as mucositis), inflammation of lung tissues (known as pneumonitis) and low red blood cell counts (anaemia). 
We include two studies that randomised 361 women. In one study, women received either an mTOR inhibitor (temsirolimus) in combination with other chemotherapy drugs, or the same chemotherapy drugs without the mTOR inhibitor and with a different targeted therapy (bevacizumab). This was given as part of their 'first‐line' treatment after their initial diagnosis of advanced endometrial cancer. In the second study, women with recurrent disease or who had been treated with chemotherapy at least once before received an mTOR inhibitor (ridaforolimus) on its own, compared with a chemotherapy or hormonal therapy and no mTOR inhibitor. 
What are the main results of the review? For women who received mTOR inhibitor drugs as part of their first treatment, there may be a higher risk of disease worsening with an mTOR inhibitor than with conventional treatment and bevacizumab. However, for women with recurrent disease who had received chemotherapy previously, receiving an mTOR inhibitor drug may reduce the risk of the disease worsening compared to further chemotherapy or hormonal treatments. These results are based on one study only in each treatment setting. 
There were side effects from mTOR inhibitors. Women may be more likely to experience ulcers within the digestive tract with mTOR inhibitors than women who received treatments without these drugs. There was probably little or no difference in the rates of inflammation of the lungs or anaemia between those who received mTOR inhibitors and those who did not, although we have only low certainty evidence about the result. None of the studies reported quality‐of‐life information. 
There are five clinical trials currently recruiting women. We hope to have a clearer answer in the next update of this review, once data from these studies are available. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? We searched for studies that had been published up to January 2019.","# Plain Language Summary: PI3K/AKT/mTOR Inhibitors for Advanced Endometrial Cancer

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether a new type of medicine called PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors can help women with advanced endometrial cancer (cancer of the uterus lining that has spread or come back). Researchers wanted to know if these medicines work better and are safer than standard treatments like chemotherapy.

## Why does this matter?

Endometrial cancer is a common cancer in developed countries. When the cancer is advanced or has spread to other parts of the body, current treatments don't work well enough. Doctors need better options to help patients live longer and have fewer side effects.

## What did researchers do?

The researchers searched for studies that compared a new medicine containing a PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor against standard cancer treatments. They found 2 completed studies involving 361 women total.

**Study 1:** Tested a medicine called temsirolimus combined with two chemotherapy drugs versus chemotherapy alone in women who hadn't received prior treatment.

**Study 2:** Tested a medicine called ridaforolimus alone versus hormone therapy or chemotherapy in women who had already been treated before.

## What did they find?

**For women getting treatment for the first time:**
- The new medicine may have made cancer worse (it came back faster)
- It didn't help people live longer
- It didn't shrink tumors better than standard treatment

**For women getting treatment a second or third time:**
- The new medicine may have slowed cancer growth better than standard treatment
- It still didn't help people live longer
- It didn't shrink tumors better

**Side effects:**
- The new medicine may cause more mouth sores
- It didn't cause more anemia or lung problems than standard treatment

## What happens next?

The researchers found only 2 studies with limited information. They are waiting for at least 5 more studies to finish before making final recommendations about using these medicines.","### Study Summary: Testing New Treatments for Advanced Endometrial Cancer

**Objective:**
This study looks at whether new treatments called PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors can help women with advanced endometrial cancer. The goal is to see if these treatments can stop the cancer from growing and are safe to use.

**Who Participated:**
The study involved 361 women with advanced or recurring endometrial cancer.

**Treatments Tested:**
- **First Group:** Received a mix of drugs including temsirolimus, carboplatin, and paclitaxel.
- **Second Group:** Took ridaforolimus alone or with other common cancer treatments.

**What They Measured:**
- How long the cancer stayed stable without getting worse (progression-free survival).
- Side effects like severe mouth sores (mucositis).
- Overall survival time.
- The cancer’s response to treatment.

**Results:**
- In women getting treatment for the first time, adding an mTOR inhibitor did not greatly improve how long they lived without cancer getting worse.
- For women who had been treated before, the mTOR inhibitors seemed to help stop the cancer from growing.
- Some side effects were more common, like severe mouth sores, but there was little change in other side effects like anemia.
- There wasn’t a big difference in overall survival or how well the cancer shrank.

**Safety and Quality of Life:**
The study didn't measure or report on how these treatments affected the women’s quality of life.

**Conclusion:**
The results show some promise for mTOR inhibitors in women who have previously been treated, but we still need more information. New studies are being done to learn more about these drugs in endometrial cancer."
"Background
Foot ulcers in people with diabetes are non‐healing, or poorly healing, partial, or full‐thickness wounds below the ankle. These ulcers are common, expensive to manage and cause significant morbidity and mortality. The presence of a wound has an impact on nutritional status because of the metabolic cost of repairing tissue damage, in addition to the nutrient losses via wound fluid. Nutritional interventions may improve wound healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of nutritional interventions on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. 
Search methods
In March 2020 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of nutritional interventions on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors, working independently, assessed included RCTs for their risk of bias and rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology, using pre‐determined inclusion and quality criteria. 
Main results
We identified nine RCTs (629 participants). Studies explored oral nutritional interventions as follows: a protein (20 g protein per 200 mL bottle), 1 kcal/mL ready‐to‐drink, nutritional supplement with added vitamins, minerals and trace elements; arginine, glutamine and β‐hydroxy‐β‐methylbutyrate supplement; 220 mg zinc sulphate supplements; 250 mg magnesium oxide supplements; 1000 mg/day omega‐3 fatty acid from flaxseed oil; 150,000 IU of vitamin D, versus 300,000 IU of vitamin D; 250 mg magnesium oxide plus 400 IU vitamin E and 50,000 IU vitamin D supplements. The comparator in eight studies was placebo, and in one study a different dose of vitamin D. 
Eight studies reported the primary outcome measure of ulcer healing; only two studies reported a measure of complete healing. Six further studies reported measures of change in ulcer dimension, these studies reported only individual parameters of ulcer dimensions (i.e. length, width and depth) and not change in ulcer volume. 
All of the evidence identified was very low certainty. We downgraded it for risks of bias, indirectness and imprecision. 
It is uncertain whether oral nutritional supplement with 20 g protein per 200 mL bottle, 1 kcal/mL, nutritional supplement with added vitamins, minerals and trace elements, increases the proportion of ulcers healed at six months more than placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 1.53). It is also uncertain whether arginine, glutamine and β‐hydroxy‐β‐methylbutyrate supplement increases the proportion of ulcers healed at 16 weeks compared with placebo (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.40). 
It is uncertain whether the following interventions change parameters of ulcer dimensions over time when compared with placebo; 220 mg zinc sulphate supplement containing 50 mg elemental zinc, 250 mg magnesium oxide supplement, 1000 mg/day omega‐3 fatty acid from flaxseed oil supplement, magnesium and vitamin E co‐supplementation and vitamin D supplementation. It is also uncertain whether 150,000 IU of vitamin D, impacts ulcer dimensions when compared with 300,000 IU of vitamin D. 
Two studies explored some of the secondary outcomes of interest for this review. It is uncertain whether oral nutritional supplement with 20 g protein per 200 mL bottle, 1 kcal/mL, nutritional supplement with added vitamins, minerals and trace elements, reduces the number of deaths (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.60) or amputations (RR 4.82, 95% CI 0.24 to 95.88) more than placebo. It is uncertain whether arginine, glutamine and β‐hydroxy‐β‐methylbutyrate supplement increases health‐related quality of life at 16 weeks more than placebo (MD −0.03, 95% CI −0.09 to 0.03). It is also uncertain whether arginine, glutamine and β‐hydroxy‐β‐methylbutyrate supplement reduces the numbers of new ulcers (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.51), or amputations (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.69) more than placebo. 
None of the included studies reported the secondary outcomes cost of intervention, acceptability of the intervention (or satisfaction) with respect to patient comfort, length of patient hospital stay, surgical interventions, or osteomyelitis incidence. 
One study exploring the impact of arginine, glutamine and β‐hydroxy‐β‐methylbutyrate supplement versus placebo did not report on any relevant outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence for the impact of nutritional interventions on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes compared with no nutritional supplementation, or compared with a different dose of nutritional supplementation, remains uncertain, with eight studies showing no clear benefit or harm. It is also uncertain whether there is a difference in rates of adverse events, amputation rate, development of new foot ulcers, or quality of life, between nutritional interventions and placebo. More research is needed to clarify the impact of nutritional interventions on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes.","Dietary supplements for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes
What is the aim of this review? 
We wanted to find out whether nutritional supplements or special diets are effective in treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes. Researchers from Cochrane collected and analysed all relevant studies (randomised controlled trials (RCTs)) to answer this question and found nine studies for inclusion. RCTs are medical studies where the treatment or care people receive is are chosen at random. This type of trial provides the most reliable health evidence about whether different approaches to treatment or care make a difference. 
Key messages 
Of the nine studies that we identified, eight reported the outcomes we were interested in, primarily impact on ulcer healing. Findings from five studies showed very low‐certainty evidence regarding the effect of oral nutritional supplements in tablet form on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. These five studies did not measure healing in such a way that we could be certain of the results, and they did not have enough participants for us to be certain of the effects. The results of three other studies also showed very low‐certainty evidence as to whether nutritional supplements in other forms have any impact on ulcer healing. Two of these studies showed very low‐certainty evidence as to whether nutritional supplement drinks have any impact on other outcomes such as death, likelihood of amputation, reduction in numbers of new ulcers, or people's quality of life. These studies were not well conducted and did not have enough participants involved for us to be certain of the effects. 
What was studied in the review? 
People with diabetes can develop foot ulcers. These are often due to reduced blood supply, reduced sensation, foot deformity, the presence of trauma, or a combination of all or some of these causes. Foot ulcers are a serious complication of diabetes and can result in serious consequences such as amputation. 
It is thought that foot ulcers, like other wounds, heal better, and more quickly, if people are well‐nourished. Food supplements containing certain vitamins and protein can be given to people with foot ulcers and diabetes to help to treat their wounds. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found nine relevant studies dating from 2004 to 2019, involving 629 participants, 72% were men, aged, on average, 59.2 years. Most studies took place in hospital outpatient clinics. Three studies explored a different nutritional supplement drink and compared this with a drink that looked the same but did not have any added nutritional supplement. Five studies explored the effects of different types of nutritional tablets and compared these with tablets that did not contain any active ingredient, or nutritional supplement. One study compared two different doses of a vitamin D injection. One study did not report any of the outcomes of interest for this review. 
Two of the studies were sponsored by the manufacturers of the nutritional supplement, five studies were sponsored by Iranian university research funding. 
Findings from eight studies are unclear as to whether nutritional interventions improve the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes compared with no nutritional supplementation, or compared with a different dose of nutritional supplementation. One study reported adverse events and two studies reported numbers of amputations. Results are unclear as to whether there is a difference in the numbers of amputations or deaths between nutritional supplementation and no nutritional supplementation. It is also unclear if there is a difference in health‐related quality of life or number of ulcers that recur between nutritional supplementation and no nutritional supplementation. 
Overall, we judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low. None of the studies had enough participants, five did not measure outcomes in such a way that we could be certain of the results and the studies were not well conducted, so we are not very confident in the results. Additional studies at low risk of bias and of high‐certainty evidence are needed to clarify the role of nutritional interventions for the treatment of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. 
How up to date is this review? 
We searched for studies that had been published up to March 2020.","# Plain Language Summary: Nutritional Supplements and Foot Ulcers in People with Diabetes

## What is this study about?

People with diabetes sometimes develop sores (ulcers) on their feet that don't heal well. These sores are painful, costly to treat, and can cause serious health problems. When your body is trying to heal a wound, it needs extra nutrients. This study looked at whether taking special nutritional supplements (vitamins, minerals, proteins, and other nutrients) could help these foot ulcers heal better.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers searched for studies that tested different nutritional supplements in people with diabetes who had foot ulcers. They found 9 studies with a total of 629 people. These studies tested supplements like:
- Protein and vitamin drinks
- Zinc supplements
- Magnesium supplements
- Omega-3 fatty acids
- Vitamin D
- Vitamin E

Most studies compared the supplement to a placebo (a fake pill with no medicine).

## What did they find?

The researchers could not find clear proof that any of these supplements helped foot ulcers heal better. The studies tested different supplements and measured results in different ways, making it hard to compare them. The quality of the evidence was very low, meaning researchers weren't confident in the results.

## What does this mean?

Right now, we don't know for sure whether nutritional supplements help diabetic foot ulcers heal. More research is needed to find out if these supplements actually work.","**Can Nutrition Help Heal Foot Sores in People with Diabetes?**

**Background**

People with diabetes sometimes develop sores on their feet that are hard to heal. These sores can be costly to treat and can lead to serious health problems. Eating the right nutrients might help these sores heal better.

**Purpose of the Study**

This study looks at whether special nutrition can help heal foot sores in people with diabetes.

**What Was Done**

Researchers searched for studies from different databases in March 2020. They wanted to find studies that tested different nutrients to see if they help heal foot sores in people with diabetes. Only studies where people were randomly given either nutrients or a placebo were included.

**Who Was Studied**

The study involved nine different research trials with a total of 629 participants.

**Nutritional Interventions Tested**

1. Protein drinks with vitamins and minerals.
2. Supplements with arginine, glutamine, and other nutrients.
3. Zinc and magnesium supplements.
4. Flaxseed oil for omega-3 fatty acids.
5. Different amounts of vitamin D and other vitamins.

**Results**

- The study couldn't confirm if these nutrients helped sores heal better than a placebo.
- It was unclear if these nutrients reduced deaths or amputations.
- The effects on new sores or overall quality of life were also uncertain.
- Some studies measured changes in sore size, but results were not clear.

**Safety and Side Effects**

The study found no clear differences in side effects between those taking nutrients and those taking a placebo.

**Conclusion**

We still don't know if special nutrition helps foot sores heal in people with diabetes. More research is needed to understand how these nutrients might help."
"Background
Peripheral joint osteoarthritis is a major cause of pain and functional limitation. Few treatments are safe and effective. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of acupuncture for treating peripheral joint osteoarthritis.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 1), MEDLINE, and EMBASE (both through December 2007), and scanned reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing needle acupuncture with a sham, another active treatment, or a waiting list control group in people with osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, or hand. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We calculated standardized mean differences using the differences in improvements between groups. 
Main results
Sixteen trials involving 3498 people were included. Twelve of the RCTs included only people with OA of the knee, 3 only OA of the hip, and 1 a mix of people with OA of the hip and/or knee. In comparison with a sham control, acupuncture showed statistically significant, short‐term improvements in osteoarthritis pain (standardized mean difference ‐0.28, 95% confidence interval ‐0.45 to ‐0.11; 0.9 point greater improvement than sham on 20 point scale; absolute percent change 4.59%; relative percent change 10.32%; 9 trials; 1835 participants) and function (‐0.28, ‐0.46 to ‐0.09; 2.7 point greater improvement on 68 point scale; absolute percent change 3.97%; relative percent change 8.63%); however, these pooled short‐term benefits did not meet our predefined thresholds for clinical relevance (i.e. 1.3 points for pain; 3.57 points for function) and there was substantial statistical heterogeneity. Additionally, restriction to sham‐controlled trials using shams judged most likely to adequately blind participants to treatment assignment (which were also the same shams judged most likely to have physiological activity), reduced heterogeneity and resulted in pooled short‐term benefits of acupuncture that were smaller and non‐significant. In comparison with sham acupuncture at the six‐month follow‐up, acupuncture showed borderline statistically significant, clinically irrelevant improvements in osteoarthritis pain (‐0.10, ‐0.21 to 0.01; 0.4 point greater improvement than sham on 20 point scale; absolute percent change 1.81%; relative percent change 4.06%; 4 trials;1399 participants) and function (‐0.11, ‐0.22 to 0.00; 1.2 point greater improvement than sham on 68 point scale; absolute percent change 1.79%; relative percent change 3.89%). In a secondary analysis versus a waiting list control, acupuncture was associated with statistically significant, clinically relevant short‐term improvements in osteoarthritis pain (‐0.96, ‐1.19 to ‐0.72; 14.5 point greater improvement than sham on 100 point scale; absolute percent change 14.5%; relative percent change 29.14%; 4 trials; 884 participants) and function (‐0.89, ‐1.18 to ‐0.60; 13.0 point greater improvement than sham on 100 point scale; absolute percent change 13.0%; relative percent change 25.21%). In the head‐on comparisons of acupuncture with the 'supervised osteoarthritis education' and the 'physician consultation' control groups, acupuncture was associated with clinically relevant short‐ and long‐term improvements in pain and function. In the head on comparisons of acupuncture with 'home exercises/advice leaflet' and 'supervised exercise', acupuncture was associated with similar treatment effects as the controls. Acupuncture as an adjuvant to an exercise based physiotherapy program did not result in any greater improvements than the exercise program alone. Information on safety was reported in only 8 trials and even in these trials there was limited reporting and heterogeneous methods. 
Authors' conclusions
Sham‐controlled trials show statistically significant benefits; however, these benefits are small, do not meet our pre‐defined thresholds for clinical relevance, and are probably due at least partially to placebo effects from incomplete blinding. Waiting list‐controlled trials of acupuncture for peripheral joint osteoarthritis suggest statistically significant and clinically relevant benefits, much of which may be due to expectation or placebo effects.","Acupuncture for osteoarthritis
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of acupuncture on osteoarthritis. 
The review shows that in people with osteoarthritis, 
‐Acupuncture may lead to small improvements in pain and physical function after 8 weeks. 
‐Acupuncture may lead to small improvements in pain and physical function after 26 weeks. 
We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects. Possible side effects of acupuncture treatment include minor bruising and bleeding at the site of needle insertion. 
What is osteoarthritis and what is acupuncture? 
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, such as your knee or hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try and repair the damage. Instead of making things better, however, the bone grows abnormally and makes things worse. For example, the bone can become misshapen and make the joint painful and unstable. This can affect your physical function or ability to use your knee. 
According to the philosophy of traditional acupuncture, energy circulates in 'meridians' located throughout the body.  Pain or ill health happens when something occurs to cause this meridian energy circulation to be blocked. The way to restore health is to stimulate the appropriate combination of acupuncture points in the body by inserting very thin needles.  Sometimes in painful conditions, electrical stimulation along with the needles is also used.  According to acupuncture theory, one way you can tell that acupuncture is relieving pain is that you may feel numbness or tingling, called de qi, where the needle is inserted. 
Best estimate of what happens to people with osteoarthritis who have acupuncture: 
Pain after 8 weeks: 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by about 4 points on a scale of 0 to 20.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by about 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20. 
‐People who received acupuncture had a 1 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐20.  (5% absolute improvement). 
Pain after 26 weeks: 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by slightly more than 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by slightly less than 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20. 
‐People who received acupuncture had under a 1 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐20.  (2% absolute improvement).  
Physical function after 8 weeks : 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 11 points on a scale of 0 to 68.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 8 points on a scale of 0 to 68. 
‐People who received acupuncture had about a 3 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐68.  (4% absolute improvement)  
Physical function after 26 weeks : 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 11 points on a scale of 0 to 68.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 10 points on a scale of 0 to 68. 
‐People who received acupuncture had about a 1 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐68.  (2% absolute improvement)","# Plain Language Summary: Acupuncture for Joint Arthritis

## What is this study about?
Researchers wanted to find out if acupuncture (using thin needles on the skin) helps people with arthritis pain in their knees, hips, or hands.

## Why does this matter?
Joint arthritis causes a lot of pain and makes it hard for people to move and do daily activities. There aren't many safe treatments that really work well.

## What did researchers do?
They looked at 16 studies involving 3,498 people. Most studies tested acupuncture on people with knee arthritis. Researchers compared acupuncture to:
- Fake acupuncture (sham treatment)
- Other treatments like exercise or education
- Waiting lists (no treatment)

## What did they find?

**Acupuncture vs. Fake Acupuncture:**
- Acupuncture showed small improvements in pain and movement compared to fake acupuncture
- However, the improvements were so small they probably don't make a real difference in how people feel
- The benefits may have come from people *expecting* acupuncture to work, not from the needles themselves

**Acupuncture vs. Waiting (No Treatment):**
- Acupuncture showed bigger improvements in pain and movement
- But again, much of this improvement may be from people expecting it to work

**Acupuncture vs. Exercise or Education:**
- Acupuncture worked about the same as exercise or doctor education
- Adding acupuncture to exercise didn't help more than exercise alone

## Safety
Only 8 studies reported safety information, and the reporting was limited. More information is needed.

## Bottom line
Acupuncture may help a little, but the benefits are small and may mostly come from people expecting it to work rather than from the needles themselves.","### Plain Language Summary

**Purpose of the Study**
The study looked at how acupuncture affects pain and movement for people with osteoarthritis in the knees, hips, or hands.

**Who Was Studied**
Researchers focused on 3,498 people with osteoarthritis in the joints mentioned above.

**What They Did**
- They compared acupuncture with fake acupuncture (called sham), other treatments, or no treatment while waiting.
- The study reviewed 16 different trials.

**Main Findings**
- Acupuncture showed a small improvement in pain and movement compared to sham acupuncture, but the effects were not very noticeable.
- When compared to those on a waiting list, acupuncture showed more noticeable benefits in the short term.
- Acupuncture’s effects were about the same as other treatments like educational sessions and exercise advice.
- Combining acupuncture with exercise didn’t improve results more than exercise alone.

**Safety**
Only 8 out of the 16 trials reported information on safety, and there were differences in how they collected this information.

**Conclusion**
- Acupuncture showed some benefits, but these might be due to people expecting it to work rather than the treatment itself.
- The results might change depending on the type of study or comparison group used."
"Background
Concerns regarding the safety of transfused blood have prompted reconsideration of the use of allogeneic (from an unrelated donor) red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, and a range of techniques to minimise transfusion requirements. 
Objectives
To examine the evidence for the efficacy of cell salvage in reducing allogeneic blood transfusion and the evidence for any effect on clinical outcomes. 
Search methods
We identified studies by searching CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1950 to June 2009), EMBASE (1980 to June 2009), the internet (to August 2009) and bibliographies of published articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials with a concurrent control group in which adult patients, scheduled for non‐urgent surgery, were randomised to cell salvage (autotransfusion) or to a control group who did not receive the intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Data were independently extracted and the risk of bias assessed. Relative risks (RR) and weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Data were pooled using a random‐effects model. The primary outcomes were the number of patients exposed to allogeneic red cell transfusion and the amount of blood transfused. Other clinical outcomes are detailed in the review. 
Main results
A total of 75 trials were included. Overall, the use of cell salvage reduced the rate of exposure to allogeneic RBC transfusion by a relative 38% (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.70). The absolute reduction in risk (ARR) of receiving an allogeneic RBC transfusion was 21% (95% CI 15% to 26%). In orthopaedic procedures the RR of exposure to RBC transfusion was 0.46 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.57) compared to 0.77 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.86) for cardiac procedures. The use of cell salvage resulted in an average saving of 0.68 units of allogeneic RBC per patient (WMD ‐0.68; 95% CI ‐0.88 to ‐0.49). Cell salvage did not appear to impact adversely on clinical outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
The results suggest cell salvage is efficacious in reducing the need for allogeneic red cell transfusion in adult elective cardiac and orthopaedic surgery. The use of cell salvage did not appear to impact adversely on clinical outcomes. However, the methodological quality of trials was poor. As the trials were unblinded and lacked adequate concealment of treatment allocation, transfusion practices may have been influenced by knowledge of the patients' treatment status potentially biasing the results in favour of cell salvage.","Cell salvage (collecting a patient's own blood during surgery) for reducing transfusions with donated blood 
Some patients who undergo surgery require blood transfusions to compensate for the blood loss that occurs during the procedure. Often the blood used for the transfusion has been donated by a volunteer. The risks associated with receiving volunteer donor blood that has been screened by a competently managed modern laboratory are considered minimal, with the risk of contracting diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C being extremely low. However there is concern in many developing countries, where there is a high prevalence of such infections and transfusion services are inadequately equipped to screen donor blood as thoroughly. Although in developed countries the risks of acquiring a disease from transfused blood are low, the financial costs associated with providing a safe and reliable blood product are escalating. Therefore there is much attention being placed on alternative strategies to minimise the need for transfusions of donor blood. 
'Cell salvage' or 'autotransfusion' is one technique designed to reduce the use of such transfusions. It involves the collection of a patient's own blood from surgical sites which can be transfused back into the same person during or after surgery, as required. 
The authors undertook this systematic review to examine the evidence for the effectiveness of cell salvage in reducing the need for blood transfusions of donor blood in adults (over 18 years) undergoing surgery. 
The authors found 75 studies investigating the effectiveness of cell salvage in orthopaedic (36 studies), cardiac (33 studies), and vascular (6 studies) surgery. Overall, the findings show that cell salvage reduces the need for transfusions of donated blood. The authors conclude that there appears to be sufficient evidence to support the use of cell salvage in cardiac and orthopaedic surgery. Cell salvage does not appear to cause any adverse clinical outcomes. 
As the methodological quality of the trials was poor, the findings may be biased in favour of cell salvage. Large trials of high methodological quality that assess the relative effectiveness, safety, and cost‐effectiveness of cell salvage in different surgical procedures should be the focus of future research in this area.","# Plain Language Summary: Cell Salvage During Surgery

## What is this study about?

This study looked at a medical technique called ""cell salvage"" (also called autotransfusion) used during surgery. Researchers wanted to know if this technique reduces the need for blood transfusions from donors and whether it affects patient outcomes.

## Why does this matter?

Doctors sometimes worry about the safety of blood transfusions from other people. Cell salvage is a way to collect a patient's own blood during surgery and give it back to them, rather than using blood from a donor.

## What did researchers do?

Scientists reviewed 75 different research studies that tested cell salvage during planned (non-urgent) surgery in adults. They compared patients who received cell salvage to patients who did not receive it.

## What did they find?

**Main results:**
- Cell salvage reduced the need for donor blood transfusions by about 38%
- On average, patients who received cell salvage needed 0.68 fewer units of donor blood
- Cell salvage worked especially well for bone and joint surgery (46% reduction)
- Cell salvage worked less well for heart surgery (23% reduction)
- Cell salvage did not cause harm to patients

## Important note

The researchers said the studies they reviewed had quality problems because doctors and patients knew who was receiving cell salvage, which may have affected the results.","### Plain Language Summary

This study looks at a way to use a patient's own blood during surgery instead of blood from donors, to make surgeries safer.

**What’s the Goal?**
The goal is to see if using a person’s own blood, a method called cell salvage, can reduce the need for donor blood during non-urgent surgeries and check if it affects patient health.

**Who’s in the Study?**
The study focused on adults having planned surgeries that were not emergencies. Participants were randomly chosen to use cell salvage or not.

**What Did They Do?**
Researchers looked at studies between 1950 and 2009 about using cell salvage. They compared those who used it with those who didn’t to see how many needed donor blood and how much was needed.

**What Did They Find?**
- Using cell salvage meant fewer people needed donor blood. It cut the need by about 38%.
- In orthopedic surgeries, the need for donor blood dropped more than in heart surgeries.
- On average, patients saved about 0.68 units of donor blood.
- Using cell salvage did not seem to harm patients’ health.

**What Does This Mean?**
Cell salvage could help reduce the need for donor blood in some surgeries, which may be safer for patients. However, researchers think some study details were not handled well, so the results might be biased.

### Key Points
- The method can make surgeries safer by using less donor blood.
- It works better in some types of surgeries than in others.
- More careful studies are needed to be sure of the results."
"Background
Available evidence on the effects of a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) of 60% to 90% compared with a routine fraction of inspired oxygen of 30% to 40%, during anaesthesia and surgery, on mortality and surgical site infection has been inconclusive. Previous trials and meta‐analyses have led to different conclusions on whether a high fraction of supplemental inspired oxygen during anaesthesia may decrease or increase mortality and surgical site infections in surgical patients. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of an FIO2 equal to or greater than 60% compared with a control FIO2 at or below 40% in the perioperative setting in terms of mortality, surgical site infection, respiratory insufficiency, serious adverse events and length of stay during the index admission for adult surgical patients. 
We looked at various outcomes, conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses, examined the role of bias and applied trial sequential analysis (TSA) to examine the level of evidence supporting or refuting a high FIO2 during surgery, anaesthesia and recovery. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, International Web of Science, the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS), advanced Google and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) up to February 2014. We checked the references of included trials and reviews for unidentified relevant trials and reran the searches in March 2015. We will consider two studies of interest when we update the review. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized clinical trials that compared a high fraction of inspired oxygen with a routine fraction of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia, surgery and recovery in individuals 18 years of age or older. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors extracted data independently. We conducted random‐effects and fixed‐effect meta‐analyses, and for dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs). We used published data and data obtained by contacting trial authors. 
To minimize the risk of systematic error, we assessed the risk of bias of the included trials. To reduce the risk of random errors caused by sparse data and repetitive updating of cumulative meta‐analyses, we applied trial sequential analyses. We used Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 28 randomized clinical trials (9330 participants); in the 21 trials reporting relevant outcomes for this review, 7597 participants were randomly assigned to a high fraction of inspired oxygen versus a routine fraction of inspired oxygen. 
In trials with an overall low risk of bias, a high fraction of inspired oxygen compared with a routine fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with all‐cause mortality (random‐effects model: RR 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.36; GRADE: low quality) within the longest follow‐up and within 30 days of follow‐up (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.99, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.60; GRADE: low quality). In a trial sequential analysis, the required information size was not reached and the analysis could not refute a 20% increase in mortality. Similarly, when all trials were included, a high fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with all‐cause mortality to the longest follow‐up (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.33) or within 30 days of follow‐up (Peto OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.29), both of very low quality according to GRADE. Neither was a high fraction of inspired oxygen associated with the risk of surgical site infection in trials with low risk of bias (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.17; GRADE: low quality) or in all trials (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.07; GRADE: low quality). A high fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with respiratory insufficiency (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.99), serious adverse events (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.43) or length of stay (mean difference ‐0.06 days, 95% CI ‐0.44 to 0.32 days). 
In subgroup analyses of nine trials using preoperative antibiotics, a high fraction of inspired oxygen was associated with a decrease in surgical site infections (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97; GRADE: very low quality); a similar effect was noted in the five trials adequately blinded for the outcome assessment (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96; GRADE: very low quality). We did not observe an effect of a high fraction of inspired oxygen on surgical site infections in any other subgroup analyses. 
Authors' conclusions
As the risk of adverse events, including mortality, may be increased by a fraction of inspired oxygen of 60% or higher, and as robust evidence is lacking for a beneficial effect of a fraction of inspired oxygen of 60% or higher on surgical site infection, our overall results suggest that evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of a high fraction of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia and surgery. Given the risk of attrition and outcome reporting bias, as well as other weaknesses in the available evidence, further randomized clinical trials with low risk of bias in all bias domains, including a large sample size and long‐term follow‐up, are warranted.","The effects of giving adult patients a high inspiratory oxygen fraction around the time of surgery 
Review question 
The normal air that we breathe contains 21% oxygen. This systematic review assesses the beneficial and harmful effects of a percentage of inspired oxygen of 60% to 90% compared with a routine percentage of 30% to 40% given during anaesthesia, during surgery and in the immediate recovery period on the numbers of deaths and surgical site infections reported in adult surgical patients. 
Background 
Reduced lung and circulatory function during surgery can lead to reduced levels of oxygen (hypoxia). Also, oxygen levels are often low in wounds at the end of surgery. This may impair bacterial killing and wound healing. Trials and previous meta‐analyses have led to different conclusions as to whether a high percentage of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia may decrease or increase the risk of death or surgical site infections. This systematic review used improved Cochrane methodology for carrying out systematic reviews to reassess available evidence derived from randomized clinical trials. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 28 randomized clinical trials. Eight trials with 4918 participants reported on risk of death, and 15 trials with 7219 participants reported on surgical site infections within 14 to 30 days of surgery. Four trials reported serious adverse events, three trials respiratory insufficiency, nine trials length of stay during the associated hospital admission and one trial quality of life. All trials were conducted without direct industry funding. 
The number of participants in each trial ranged from 38 to 2012. The mean age of participants was 50 years (range 15 to 92 years) and 63% were women. Types of surgery included abdominal surgery (eight trials), caesarean section (four trials), breast surgery (one trial), orthopaedic surgery (two trials) and various other surgical procedures (four trials). 
Key results 
A high percentage of inspired oxygen was not statistically associated with increased risk of death, or with a decrease in surgical site infections, in all trials that measured these outcomes, in trials of highest quality and in those with longest follow‐up. 
An increased risk of adverse events could not be proved right or wrong for a high percentage of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia and surgery. 
Quality and quantity of the evidence 
Only five of the included trials had low risk of bias. The trials randomly assigned 9330 participants, of whom only 7537 participants provided data for this review. The number of participants required to detect or reject a 20% relative risk reduction in deaths was not reached; therefore the observed results were uncertain.","# Plain Language Summary: High Oxygen During Surgery

## What is this study about?

Doctors sometimes give patients extra oxygen during surgery and anesthesia. This study looked at whether giving patients a lot of oxygen (60-90%) is better than giving them a regular amount (30-40%). Researchers wanted to know if high oxygen helps or hurts patients.

## Why does this matter?

Scientists have disagreed about whether extra oxygen during surgery helps patients. Some studies suggested it might prevent infections at the surgery site. Other studies suggested it might not help or could even cause problems. This review looked at all the research together to find the answer.

## What did researchers do?

The team searched for all high-quality studies comparing high oxygen to regular oxygen during surgery. They found 28 studies with 9,330 patients total. They combined the results to see what happened to patients in each group.

## What did they find?

**Death rates:** High oxygen did not change how many patients died compared to regular oxygen.

**Surgical site infections:** High oxygen did not clearly prevent infections in most patients. In a few studies using antibiotics, high oxygen showed a small benefit, but the evidence was weak.

**Other outcomes:** High oxygen did not affect breathing problems, serious side effects, or how long patients stayed in the hospital.

## What do the researchers conclude?

There is not enough strong evidence to recommend giving all surgery patients high oxygen. The risks may outweigh the benefits. More research is needed before changing current practice.","### Summary of Clinical Trial on Oxygen Levels During Surgery

**Objective:**  
This study looked at whether giving more oxygen (60% or higher) compared to a usual amount (30%-40%) during surgery affects patients' recovery, including survival rates and infections at the surgery site.

**Who Was Studied:**  
Adults having surgery were included in the study.

**What Was Tested:**  
Researchers compared two groups: one received high oxygen levels, and the other received standard oxygen levels during and after surgery.

**Key Outcomes Measured:**  
- Death rates
- Infections at surgery sites
- Breathing problems
- Serious side effects
- Length of hospital stay

**Main Findings:**  
- High oxygen levels did not clearly affect death rates or infections.
- No strong connection was found between high oxygen and breathing problems, other serious events, or length of stay in the hospital.
- Some studies showed that high oxygen levels might reduce infections when used with antibiotics, but the evidence was weak.

**Safety and Quality:**  
The study included 28 trials with 9,330 participants and used careful methods to check the reliability of the results, though some evidence was considered low or very low quality.

**Conclusion:**  
There isn't enough strong evidence to regularly use high oxygen levels during surgery to improve outcomes. More carefully done research with a larger number of people is needed to get clearer answers."
"Background
It has been suggested that in comparison with open radical cystectomy, robotic‐assisted radical cystectomy results in less blood loss, shorter convalescence, and fewer complications with equivalent short‐term oncological and functional outcomes; however, uncertainty remains as to the magnitude of these benefits.

Review authors conducted a comprehensive search with no restrictions on language of publication or publication status for studies comparing open radical cystectomy and robotic‐assisted radical cystectomy. The date of the last search was 1 July 2018 for the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (1999 to July 2018), PubMed Embase (1999 to July 2018), Web of Science (1999 to July 2018), Cancer Research UK (www.cancerresearchuk.org/), and the Institute of Cancer Research (www.icr.ac.uk/). We searched the following trials registers: ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov/), BioMed Central International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials Number (ISRCTN) Registry (www.isrctn.com), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. 
Selection criteria
We searched for randomised controlled trials that compared robotic‐assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with open radical cystectomy (ORC). 
Data collection and analysis
This study was based on a published protocol. Primary outcomes of the review were recurrence‐free survival and major postoperative complications (class III to V). Secondary outcomes were minor postoperative complications (class I and II), transfusion requirement, length of hospital stay (days), quality of life, and positive margins (%). Three review authors independently assessed relevant titles and abstracts of records identified by the literature search to determine which studies should be assessed further. Two review authors assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and rated the quality of evidence according to GRADE. We used Review Manager 5 to analyse the data. 
Main results
We included in the review five randomised controlled trials comprising a total of 541 participants. Total numbers of participants included in the ORC and RARC cohorts were 270 and 271, respectively. 
Primary outomes  
Time‐to‐recurrence: Robotic cystectomy and open cystectomy may result in a similar time to recurrence (hazard ratio (HR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.43); 2 trials; low‐certainty evidence). In absolute terms at 5 years of follow‐up, this corresponds to 16 more recurrences per 1000 participants (95% CI 79 fewer to 123 more) with 431 recurrences per 1000 participants for ORC. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. 
Major complications (Clavien grades 3 to 5): Robotic cystectomy and open cystectomy may result in similar rates of major complications (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.48); 5 trials; low‐certainty evidence). This corresponds to 11 more major complications per 1000 participants (95% CI 44 fewer to 89 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. 
Secondary outcomes  
Minor complications (Clavien grades 1 and 2): We are very uncertain whether robotic cystectomy may reduce minor complications (very low‐certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and for very serious imprecision. 
Transfusion rate: Robotic cystectomy probably results in substantially fewer transfusions than open cystectomy (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.80; 2 trials; moderate‐certainty evidence). This corresponds to 193 fewer transfusions per 1000 participants (95% CI 262 fewer to 92 fewer) based on 460 transfusion per 1000 participants for ORC. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations. 
Hospital stay: Robotic cystectomy may result in a slightly shorter hospital stay than open cystectomy (mean difference (MD) ‐0.67, 95% CI ‐1.22 to ‐0.12); 5 trials; low‐certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. 
Quality of life: Robotic cystectomy and open cystectomy may result in a similar quality of life (standard mean difference (SMD) 0.08, 95% CI 0.32 lower to 0.16 higher; 3 trials; low‐certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. 
Positive margin rates: Robotic cystectomy and open cystectomy may result in similar positive margin rates (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.40; 5 trials; low‐certainty evidence). This corresponds to 8 more (95% CI 21 fewer to 67 more) positive margins per 1000 participants based on 48 positive margins per 1000 participants for ORC. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. 
Authors' conclusions
Robotic cystectomy and open cystectomy may have similar outcomes with regard to time to recurrence, rates of major complications, quality of life, and positive margin rates (all low‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain whether the robotic approach reduces rates of minor complications (very low‐certainty evidence), although it probably reduces the risk of blood transfusions substantially (moderate‐certainty evidence) and may reduce hospital stay slightly (low‐certainty evidence). We were unable to conduct any of the preplanned subgroup analyses to assess the impact of patient age, pathological stage, body habitus, or surgeon expertise on outcomes. This review did not address issues of cost‐effectiveness.","Robotic versus open radical cystectomy for bladder cancer in adults
Review question 
For patients with bladder cancer that involves the deep muscle wall, does use of a robotic device lead to better or worse outcomes than open surgery? 
Background 
Patients with bladder cancer that involves the deep muscle wall are best treated by an operation that removes the entire bladder and creates an artificial bladder or channel from the bowel to allow urine to drain to the outside world. This has been done traditionally through open surgery using one large incision. Recently, this operation has been performed with robotic assistance using several small incisions. It is uncertain which approach is better. 
Study characteristics 
We performed a comprehensive literature search until 1 July 2018. We found five trials comparing robotic assisted versus open surgery. The total number of participants in these trials was 541. Four studies were conducted in the USA and one in the UK. 
Key results 
There may be little to no difference in the time to recurrence, the rate of major complications or minor complications, quality of life, and rates of positive margins (signalling that cancer may have been left behind). Robotic surgery probably results in fewer blood transfusions and may lead to a slightly shorter hospital stay when compared with open surgery. 
Certainty of evidence 
Reviewers rated the certainty of evidence as low for most outcomes, except for minor complications (very low) and transfusions (moderate). This means that the true results for these outcomes could be quite different.","# Plain Language Summary: Robotic vs. Open Surgery for Bladder Cancer

## What is this study about?

This study compared two types of surgery for bladder cancer: robotic-assisted surgery and traditional open surgery. Researchers wanted to know which approach works better, causes fewer problems, and helps patients recover faster.

## Who was in the study?

The review looked at 5 research studies with a total of 541 patients who had bladder cancer surgery. About half had robotic surgery and half had traditional open surgery.

## What did they test?

**Main things they measured:**
- Whether cancer came back and how long it took
- Serious complications (major problems after surgery)

**Other things they measured:**
- Minor complications (smaller problems after surgery)
- Need for blood transfusions
- How long patients stayed in the hospital
- Quality of life after surgery
- Whether all the cancer was removed

## What did they find?

**Cancer coming back:** Both types of surgery seemed about the same.

**Serious complications:** Both types of surgery had similar rates of major problems.

**Minor complications:** The researchers weren't sure if one was better than the other.

**Blood transfusions:** Robotic surgery needed fewer blood transfusions than open surgery. This was the clearest finding.

**Hospital stay:** Robotic surgery patients went home slightly sooner (about half a day earlier).

**Quality of life:** Both types of surgery resulted in similar quality of life afterward.

**Cancer removal:** Both surgeries removed all the cancer at similar rates.

## Bottom line

Robotic and open surgery appear to work similarly for bladder cancer. The main advantage of robotic surgery is needing fewer blood transfusions. More research is needed to be completely sure about the differences.","**Study Summary: Comparing Surgery Methods for Bladder Cancer**

**Purpose of the Study:**
This study looked at two ways of doing a surgery called radical cystectomy for adults with bladder cancer: robotic-assisted and open surgery. It wanted to see which method works better and is safer.

**Who Was Involved:**
The study included 541 people, split almost evenly between the two surgery types: 270 had open surgery, and 271 had robotic surgery.

**What Was Measured:**
The study measured several things:
- How long it takes for cancer to come back
- Major and minor surgery complications
- Need for blood transfusions
- Length of hospital stay
- Quality of life after surgery
- Success in fully removing cancer

**Findings:**
- **Cancer Recurrence:** Both types of surgery had similar results on how quickly cancer might come back after surgery.
- **Major Complications:** Both methods had similar rates of major complications after surgery.
- **Minor Complications:** It's unclear if robotic surgery reduces minor complications.
- **Blood Transfusions:** People who had robotic surgery needed fewer blood transfusions.
- **Hospital Stay:** Those who had robotic surgery stayed in the hospital slightly less time.
- **Quality of Life and Surgery Success:** Both methods showed similar results in quality of life after surgery and removing cancer successfully.

**Conclusion:**
Both robotic and open surgeries for bladder cancer seem to work similarly in many ways. Robotic surgery might help with fewer blood transfusions and shortens hospital stays a bit, but it's unclear if it helps with minor complications. The study couldn't look into other factors like age or doctor's experience, and it didn't check costs."
"Background
Drug resistance is common in focal epilepsy. In this update, we summarised the current evidence regarding add‐on levetiracetam in treating drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. The original review was published in 2001 and last updated in 2012. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of levetiracetam when used as an add‐on treatment for people with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web, which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register and CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to November 2018. We contacted the manufacturers of levetiracetam and researchers in the field to seek any ongoing or unpublished trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised, placebo‐controlled trials of add‐on levetiracetam treatment in people with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trials for bias, extracted data, and evaluated the overall certainty of the evidence. Outcomes investigated included 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency (response), treatment withdrawal, adverse effects (including a specific analysis of changes in behaviour), cognitive effects, and quality of life (QoL). Primary analysis was intention‐to‐treat. We performed meta‐analysis for all outcomes using a Mantel‐Haenszel approach and calculated risk ratios (RR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all estimates apart from adverse effects (99% CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using a Chi² test and the I² statistic. 
Main results
This update included 14 trials (2455 participants), predominantly possessing low risks of bias. Participants were adults in 12 trials (2159 participants) and children in the remaining two (296 participants). The doses of levetiracetam tested were 500 mg/day to 4000 mg/day in adults, and 60 mg/kg/day in children. Treatment ranged from 12 to 24 weeks. When individual doses were examined, levetiracetam at either 500 mg/day or 4000 mg/day did not perform better than placebo for the 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency outcome (500 mg: RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.71 to 3.62; P = 0.26; 4000 mg: RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.59 to 4.57; P = 0.34). Levetiracetam was significantly better than placebo at all other individual doses (1000 mg to 3000 mg). RR was significantly in favour of levetiracetam compared to placebo when results were pooled across all doses (RR 2.37, 95% CI 2.02 to 2.78; 14 studies, 2455 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Dose–response analysis demonstrated that the odds of achieving response (50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency) were increased by nearly 40% (odds ratio (OR) 1.39, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.58) for each 1000 mg increase in dose of levetiracetam. There were important levels of heterogeneity across multiple comparisons. 
Participants were not significantly more likely to experience treatment withdrawal with levetiracetam than with placebo (pooled RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.40; 13 studies, 2428 participants; high‐certainty evidence). 
Somnolence was the most common adverse effect, affecting 13% of participants, and it was significantly associated with levetiracetam compared to placebo (pooled RR 1.62, 99% CI 1.19 to 2.20; 13 studies, 2423 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Changes in behaviour were negligible in adults (1% affected; RR 1.79, 99% CI 0.59 to 5.41), but significant in children (23% affected; RR 1.90, 99% CI 1.16 to 3.11). Levetiracetam had a positive effect on some aspects of cognition and QoL in adults and worsened certain aspects of child behaviour. 
Authors' conclusions
Overall, this review update finds that in both adults and children with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy, levetiracetam added on to usual care is more effective than placebo at reducing seizure frequency, it is unlikely to be stopped by patients, and it has minimal adverse effects outside of potential worsening behaviour in children. These findings are unchanged from the previous review update in 2012. This review update contributes two key additional findings: 1. a 500 mg daily dose of levetiracetam is no more effective than placebo at reducing seizures; and 2. the odds of response (50% reduction in seizure frequency) are increased by nearly 40% for each 1000 mg increase in dose of levetiracetam. 
It seems reasonable to continue the use of levetiracetam in both adults and children with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy.","Levetiracetam add‐on for drug‐resistant focal epilepsy
This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review first published in 2001 and last updated in Issue 9, 2012 of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. 
Background and objective 
Epilepsy is a one of the most common disorders of the brain, affecting over 70 million people worldwide. Levetiracetam is an antiepileptic drug widely used around the world. In this review, we summarised the current evidence regarding its effectiveness when used as a treatment added on to usual care in people experiencing focal epilepsy that responds poorly to medication. 
Methods 
The evidence is current to 26 November 2018. Fourteen studies in which people were randomly assigned to either levetiracetam or a dummy tablet (placebo) were included, with a total of 2455 participants (296 of whom were children). Everybody had their usual medications continued, meaning that nobody was left without taking an antiepileptic medicine. Among other things, we looked at how many people had their frequency of seizures reduced by 50% or more when taking levetiracetam versus when taking the placebo tablet. We combined the results of all of these people in order to increase our confidence in how effective levetiracetam is. 
Key results 
Levetiracetam significantly reduced the frequency of seizures in both adults and children. Just over half of children responded to levetiracetam, and 34% of adults also responded. These responses were much higher than in the placebo groups, indicating that levetiracetam was better than placebo. The most effective doses were those of 1000 mg to 3000 mg levetiracetam. For every 1000 mg increase in dose, the chances that levetiracetam would reduce seizures (fits) appeared to improve by 40%. We noticed that the results were very different in each study we looked at. Therefore, although we could see that levetiracetam works, it was difficult for us to be certain about how large that effect actually is. 
Levetiracetam was generally tolerated well by adults and children. Most people managed to complete their course of levetiracetam during the studies. There were very few side effects with levetiracetam. The only side effect that was significantly associated with levetiracetam was somnolence (sleepiness). However, we also noticed that the behaviour of some children taking levetiracetam could worsen significantly. 
Overall, it seems reasonable to add levetiracetam to a patient's usual antiepileptic medications if they have focal epilepsy that has responded poorly to other medications.","# Plain Language Summary: Levetiracetam for Hard-to-Treat Seizures

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether a medicine called levetiracetam works when added to other seizure medicines for people whose seizures don't respond well to standard treatment.

## Who was studied?

The review combined information from 14 different studies involving 2,455 people:
- 2,159 adults
- 296 children

## What was tested?

Researchers tested whether levetiracetam (given at doses ranging from 500 to 4,000 mg per day for adults, and 60 mg per kilogram per day for children) could reduce seizures when added to the medicines people were already taking. Studies lasted 12 to 24 weeks.

## Main findings

**Seizure reduction:** Levetiracetam worked better than placebo (fake medicine) at reducing seizures—except at the lowest dose (500 mg/day). When researchers looked at all doses together, people taking levetiracetam were about 2.4 times more likely to have at least a 50% reduction in seizures. Higher doses worked better than lower doses.

**Side effects:** 
- The most common side effect was drowsiness (13% of people)
- Behavior changes were rare in adults (1%) but more common in children (23%)
- People were not more likely to stop taking the medicine

**Quality of life:** The medicine had some positive effects on thinking and quality of life in adults and some negative effects on behavior in children.

## Bottom line

Levetiracetam is effective and safe for both adults and children with hard-to-treat seizures when added to their regular medicines. However, doctors should watch for behavior changes in children.","### Plain Language Summary

**What is this about?**  
We're looking at how well a medicine called levetiracetam works for people who have focal epilepsy that doesn't get better with regular treatments.

**Who was involved?**  
The study included 2,455 people, both adults and kids, who have focal epilepsy that is hard to treat.

**What did they do?**  
People in the study took levetiracetam in different doses, from 500 mg to 4000 mg a day. Kids took 60 mg per kg of body weight each day. They tried this for 12 to 24 weeks. Some people were given a placebo (a fake pill) to compare results.

**What were they looking for?**  
Researchers wanted to see if levetiracetam helped reduce seizures by 50% or more. They also looked at side effects and whether people stopped taking the medicine.

**Main findings:**  
- Levetiracetam worked better than the placebo in reducing seizures for most doses between 1000 mg and 3000 mg.
- A 500 mg or 4000 mg dose did not work better than the placebo.
- Increasing the dose by 1000 mg increased the chances of reducing seizures by nearly 40%.
- People taking levetiracetam were not more likely to stop the treatment than those taking the placebo.
- The most common side effect was sleepiness, affecting 13% of people.
- Changes in behavior were seen more in children than adults.
- Levetiracetam had some positive effects on thinking skills and quality of life.

**What does this mean?**  
Levetiracetam seems helpful for reducing seizures in both adults and kids with hard-to-treat focal epilepsy, and most people can continue taking it without serious problems. However, it might make kids act out more. Lower doses may not be as effective.

**Conclusion**  
Levetiracetam is a good option for treating focal epilepsy when other treatments don't work. Higher doses seem to help more."
"Background
Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in young children account for 1.4 million deaths annually worldwide. Antibiotics could be beneficial in preventing LRTIs in high‐risk children, and may also help prevent school absenteeism and work days missed by children and/or carers. While it is well documented that the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis for RTIs decreases over time, there are no reviews that describe the use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent LRTIs in high‐risk children aged 12 years and under. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic prophylaxis in the prevention of bacterial LRTIs in high‐risk children aged 12 years and under. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 1) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), MEDLINE and MEDLINE In‐Process (OvidSP) (1946 to 13 February 2015), EMBASE (OvidSP) (1974 to 12 February 2015), Science Citation Index Expanded (1945 to 13 February 2015) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (Web of Science Core Collection) (1990 to 13 February 2015). We searched for ongoing studies on ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization ICTRP. We handsearched the bibliographies of retrieved full texts of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral or intravenous antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment to prevent infections in high‐risk children aged 12 years and under. We used a combination of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Health Service (NHS), American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP) and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines to define conditions at higher risk of complications. Our primary outcome was the incidence of bacterial lower respiratory infections. Secondary outcomes included clinical function, hospital admission, mortality, growth, use of secondary antibiotics, time off school or parental work, quality of life and adverse events. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data using a customised data extraction sheet, assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' criteria, and used the GRADE criteria to rate the quality of the evidence. We used a random‐effects model for meta‐analysis. We presented the results narratively where we could not statistically combine data. 
Main results
We included 10 RCTs of high‐risk children using antibiotics (azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, co‐trimoxazole, isoniazid, oral penicillin V or vancomycin) to prevent LRTIs. Three studies included HIV‐infected children (n = 1345), four cystic fibrosis (n = 429) and one each sickle cell disease (n = 219), cancer (n = 160) and low birth weight neonates with underlying respiratory disorders (n = 40). The study duration ranged from seven days to three years. The quality of the evidence from studies including children with HIV infection, cystic fibrosis or cancer was moderate. Due to inadequate data, we were unable to rate the quality of the evidence for two studies: one in children with sickle cell disease (low risk of bias), and another in low birth weight neonates with underlying respiratory disorders (high risk of bias). 
In HIV‐infected children receiving continuous isoniazid prophylaxis, there was no significant difference in the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis (risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32 to 1.29, I2 statistic = 47%, P value = 0.21). There was no significant effect on mortality with co‐trimoxazole or isoniazid prophylaxis (RR 0.82, 0.46 to 1.46, I2 statistic = 76%, P value = 0.58); however, analysis of one study that used co‐trimoxazole showed a significant reduction in mortality (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.85, P value = 0.001). There was a significant decrease in the rates of hospital admission per child‐year of follow‐up with co‐trimoxazole prophylaxis in one study (P value = 0.01). There was no evidence of increased adverse events due to antibiotic prophylaxis (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.64, I2 statistic = 22%, P value = 0.28); however, there was scant reporting of antibiotic resistance ‐ the one study that did assess this found no increase. 
In two studies of children with cystic fibrosis receiving ciprofloxacin prophylaxis, there was no significant difference in Pseudomonas infections (RR 0.76, 0.44 to 1.31, I2 statistic = 0%, P value = 0.33). In two studies assessing the benefit of azithromycin prophylaxis, there was a significant reduction in the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.76, I2 statistic = 0%, P value < 0.0001). The effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on growth in children with cystic fibrosis was inconsistent across the studies. There was an increased risk of emergence of pathogenic strains with either azithromycin or ciprofloxacin prophylaxis in two studies reporting this outcome. There was no significant difference in the quality of life (one study). In three studies, there was no significant increase in the frequency of adverse events with prophylaxis with azithromycin (two studies) or ciprofloxacin (one study). There was no evidence of increased antibiotic resistance in two studies. 
In the one study of children with sickle cell disease, a significantly lesser proportion of children with pneumococcal septicaemia was reported with penicillin V prophylaxis (P value = 0.0025). 
In the one study of children with cancer there was a significant decrease in Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.47, P value < 0.01). There was no significant increase in the frequency of adverse events with antibiotic prophylaxis. 
In low birth weight children with underlying respiratory disorders, there was no significant difference in the proportion of children with pulmonary infection with vancomycin prophylaxis (P value = 0.18). 
No included studies reported time off school or carer time off work.
Authors' conclusions
There is inconclusive evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis in certain groups of high‐risk children can reduce pneumonia, exacerbations, hospital admission and mortality in certain conditions. However, limitations in the evidence base mean more clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of antibiotics for preventing LRTIs in children at high risk should be conducted. Specifically, clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of antibiotics for preventing LRTIs in congenital heart disease, metabolic disease, endocrine and renal disorders, neurological disease or prematurity should be a priority.","Antibiotics for the prevention of lower respiratory tract infections in children at high risk aged 12 years and under 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for antibiotics to prevent bacterial lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in children aged 12 years and under who are at increased chance of contracting such infections. 
Background 
Annually, about 1.4 million children die from respiratory tract infections. One in five of these deaths occur in children under five years old. Using antibiotics to prevent LRTI in high‐risk children aged 12 years and under may be beneficial. However, no review currently describes the evidence for using antibiotics to prevent LRTI in this population. 
Study characteristics 
In February 2015, we searched for studies examining the effect of antibiotics to prevent LRTI in children aged 12 years and under with an increased risk of contracting such infections. 
We included 10 studies; three examined the effectiveness of antibiotics in 1345 children with HIV, four in 429 children with cystic fibrosis, one in 219 children with sickle cell disease, one in 160 children undergoing treatment for cancer, and one in 40 children who were underweight at birth with underlying breathing problems. 
The study duration was between 18.9 and 24.7 months for children with HIV, between six and 36 months in children with cystic fibrosis, 15 months in one study of children with sickle cell disease, 13 to 24 months in one study of children with cancer, and seven days in low birth weight newborns with underlying respiratory problems. 
Study funding sources 
Of three studies that included children with HIV, one was funded by an International Aid Agency, another by government and the third by a charity. 
Of four studies that included children with cystic fibrosis, three were funded by charities and one by government. 
The one study that included children with sickle cell disease was funded by government and the study that included children with cancer was funded by government, industry and charity. 
The funding source for the study that included newborns with underlying respiratory disorders was not specified. 
Key results 
In children with HIV, antibiotics did not reduce the likelihood of contracting tuberculosis. Overall there was no improvement in death rates, but there was a marked reduction in hospital admission with antibiotic use in one study. 
In children with cystic fibrosis, antibiotics did not reduce the likelihood of infection with Pseudomonas bacteria, but there was a reduction in flare‐ups, where bacterial infection makes it harder for the child to breathe. 
In one study of children with sickle cell disease, antibiotics reduced the likelihood of contracting blood infections. 
In one study of children with cancers, antibiotics reduced the likelihood of contracting Pneumocystis infection in the lungs. 
In low birth weight newborns with respiratory disorders, antibiotics did not reduce the likelihood of lung infections. 
Quality of the evidence 
In children with HIV, we rated the overall quality of the evidence for two studies that examined the effect of antibiotics for preventing tuberculosis as moderate because of differences in how the antibiotics were administered. We rated the quality of the evidence for antibiotic use in reducing deaths as moderate because of differences in the types of antibiotics used. Due to lack of data, we could not rate the quality of the evidence for hospital admissions. 
In children with cystic fibrosis, we rated the overall quality of the evidence for two studies that examined the effect of antibiotics in reducing the likelihood of Pseudomonas infection as moderate because of differences in the types of antibiotics used. We rated the quality of the evidence for the effect of antibiotics in reducing 'flare‐ups' as high. 
In children with cancer, we rated the quality of the evidence for the effect of antibiotics in reducing the likelihood of Pneumocystis infection as moderate because of the likelihood of indirectness of the study results. 
Due to lack of data, we could not rate the quality of the evidence for the effect of antibiotics in reducing the likelihood of blood infections in children with sickle cell disease, or in reducing the likelihood of lung infections in low birth weight newborns with respiratory disorders; the two studies had low probability and high probability of bias respectively.","# Plain Language Summary: Antibiotics to Prevent Lung Infections in High-Risk Children

## What is this study about?

Lung infections are a major cause of death in young children around the world. Researchers wanted to find out if giving antibiotics to high-risk children could help prevent serious lung infections before they start.

## Who was studied?

The review looked at 10 different studies involving children 12 years old and younger who were at high risk for lung infections. These children had conditions like:
- HIV infection
- Cystic fibrosis
- Sickle cell disease
- Cancer
- Low birth weight with lung problems

## What did they test?

Researchers compared children who received antibiotics (like azithromycin or penicillin) to prevent infections versus children who received a placebo (fake medicine) or no treatment. Studies lasted from one week to three years.

## What did they find?

**Results were mixed:**
- In children with HIV, antibiotics didn't clearly prevent lung infections
- In children with cystic fibrosis, one antibiotic (azithromycin) reduced flare-ups of lung problems
- In children with sickle cell disease, penicillin helped prevent a serious blood infection
- In children with cancer, one antibiotic prevented a specific type of pneumonia
- In premature babies with lung problems, antibiotics didn't clearly help

**Safety:** Antibiotics were generally safe, with no major increase in side effects.

## What does this mean?

The evidence shows antibiotics *might* help some high-risk children, but the results aren't clear enough to say for certain. More research is needed.","### Can Antibiotics Help High-Risk Kids Avoid Lung Infections?

**Purpose of the Study**
This study looked at whether giving antibiotics to young children who are more likely to get lung infections can help keep them healthy and safe.

**Who Was Studied?**
The study included children aged 12 and under who are at high risk for lung infections. These groups included children with conditions like HIV, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, cancer, and low birth weight.

**What Was Done?**
The researchers looked at different studies where high-risk children received antibiotics versus no treatment, to see if the antibiotics helped prevent lung infections. Some of these antibiotics were given by mouth or through an IV.

**What Were They Measuring?**
The study focused on:
- How many children got lung infections.
- Other health outcomes like hospital visits, growth, and side effects.
- Time children were healthy enough to attend school or if their caregivers missed work.

**Findings**
- Children with HIV who received certain antibiotics did not have a significant reduction in lung infections.
- For those with cystic fibrosis, one antibiotic helped reduce flare-ups, but there were concerns about drug-resistant germs.
- In children with sickle cell disease, antibiotics helped prevent a serious infection.
- In children with cancer, antibiotics helped prevent a specific type of pneumonia.
- For low birth weight babies, there was no strong evidence that antibiotics reduced lung infections.

**Safety**
In general, the antibiotics did not cause more side effects than expected and resistance was not a major problem in most studies.

**Conclusion**
Antibiotics could help prevent lung infections in some high-risk children, but the findings weren't strong enough for all groups. More studies are needed, especially for other high-risk conditions like heart or kidney issues."
"Background
Critically ill patients require regular body position changes to minimize the adverse effects of bed rest, inactivity and immobilization. However, uncertainty surrounds the effectiveness of lateral positioning for improving pulmonary gas exchange, aiding drainage of tracheobronchial secretions and preventing morbidity. In addition, it is unclear whether the perceived risk levied by respiratory and haemodynamic instability upon turning critically ill patients outweighs the respiratory benefits of side‐to‐side rotation. Thus, lack of certainty may contribute to variation in positioning practice and equivocal patient outcomes. 
Objectives
To evaluate effects of the lateral position compared with other body positions on patient outcomes (mortality, morbidity and clinical adverse events) in critically ill adult patients. (Clinical adverse events include hypoxaemia, hypotension, low oxygen delivery and global indicators of impaired tissue oxygenation.) We examined single use of the lateral position (i.e. on the right or left side) and repeat use of the lateral position (i.e. lateral positioning) within a positioning schedule. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1950 to 23 May 2015), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1937 to 23 May 2015), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (1984 to 23 May 2015), Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1901 to 23 May 2015), Web of Science (1945 to 23 May 2015), Index to Theses in Great Britain and Ireland (1950 to 23 May 2015), Trove (2009 to 23 May 2015; previously Australasian Digital Theses Program (1997 to December 2008)) and Proquest Dissertations and Theses (2009 to 23 May 2015; previously Proquest Digital Dissertations (1980 to 23 May 2015)). We handsearched the reference lists of potentially relevant reports and two nursing journals. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized and quasi‐randomized trials examining effects of lateral positioning in critically ill adults. We included manual or automated turns but limited eligibility to studies that included duration of body position of 10 minutes or longer. We examined each lateral position versus at least one comparator (opposite lateral position and/or another body position) for single therapy effects, and the lateral positioning schedule (repeated lateral turning) versus other positioning schedules for repetitive therapy effects. 
Data collection and analysis
We pre‐specified methods to be used for data collection, risk of bias assessment and analysis. Two independent review authors carried out each stage of selection and data extraction and settled differences in opinion by consensus, or by third party adjudication when disagreements remained unresolved. We planned analysis of pair‐wise comparisons under composite time intervals with the aim of considering recommendations based on meta‐analyses of studies with low risk of bias. 
Main results
We included 24 studies of critically ill adults. No study reported mortality as an outcome of interest. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examined lateral positioning for pulmonary morbidity outcomes but provided insufficient information for meta‐analysis. A total of 22 randomized trials examined effects of lateral positioning (four parallel‐group and 18 cross‐over designs) by measuring various continuous data outcomes commonly used to detect adverse cardiopulmonary events within critical care areas. However, parallel‐group studies were not comparable, and cross‐over studies provided limited data as the result of unit of analysis errors. Eight studies provided some data; most of these were single studies with small effects that were imprecise. We pooled partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) as a measure to detect hypoxaemia from two small studies of participants with unilateral lung disease (n = 19). The mean difference (MD) between lateral positions (bad lung down versus good lung down) was approximately 50 mmHg (MD ‐49.26 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐67.33 to ‐31.18; P value < 0.00001). Despite a lower mean PaO2 for bad lung down, hypoxaemia (mean PaO2 < 60 mmHg) was not consistently reported. Furthermore, pooled data had methodological shortcomings with unclear risk of bias. We had similar doubts regarding internal validity for other studies included in the review. 
Authors' conclusions
Review authors could provide no clinical practice recommendations based on the findings of included studies. Available research could not eliminate the uncertainty surrounding benefits and/or risks associated with lateral positioning of critically ill adult patients. Research gaps include the effectiveness of lateral positioning compared with semi recumbent positioning for mechanically ventilated patients, lateral positioning compared with prone positioning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and less frequent changes in body position. We recommend that future research be undertaken to address whether the routine practice of repositioning patients on their side benefits all, some or few critically ill patients.","Lateral positioning for critically ill adult patients
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of turning critically ill adults from side to side while lying on a hospital bed. We found 24 studies. 
Background 
Nurses change the body position of critically ill patients as frequently as every two hours to prevent bed sores and other complications associated with immobility. Turning from side to side may also help loosen and drain secretions accumulated within the lungs. Routine lateral repositioning is a relatively safe standard practice. However, if a patient's blood pressure or oxygen level drops to a dangerously low reading during the position change, urgent medical attention is required. Most events resolve quickly, but for some patients these events may be slow to resolve and are potentially life‐threatening. We wanted to discover whether routine lateral repositioning is better than other positioning strategies including less frequent turns, and whether a lateral position may cause more adverse events. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to May 2015.
Study characteristics 
We included randomized studies of critically ill adults receiving treatment in intensive care units and in other critical care areas. We selected studies that included lateral positioning after a single turn or following repetitive turns. The duration of each body position was 10 minutes or longer. Comparisons included the other lateral position (opposite side), as well as supine (lying on your back), semi recumbent (lying on your back with your upper body elevated to a 45‐degree angle) and prone (lying on your stomach) positions. 
Results 
We found 24 eligible studies. No studies reported on mortality. Two studies reported on pulmonary morbidity following cardiac surgery, but available data were insufficient for analysis. The other studies reported measures that we included to identify clinical adverse events. Most of these studies did not report results in a way that could be combined for review of evidence, and trial design was often dissimilar. We compared two studies of critically ill adults with unilateral lung disease (one 'bad lung' and one 'good lung'). Oxygen levels within the blood were lower for 'bad lung down' (side lying with the 'bad lung' lowermost). However, the sample was small, both studies were of poor quality and very low oxygen levels in the blood were not consistently found across studies. Therefore, results need to be viewed with caution. 
Conclusion 
We found no clear evidence on the effectiveness of routine lateral repositioning or the effects of a single turn for critically ill patients. Good quality studies are needed to find out whether routine lateral repositioning is still recommended for most critically ill patients, and whether one body position is best avoided for some.","# Plain Language Summary: Body Positioning in Critically Ill Patients

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether turning critically ill patients onto their sides helps them get better. Doctors and nurses regularly turn patients in the hospital to prevent problems from lying in one position too long. However, doctors aren't sure if turning patients on their sides actually helps them breathe better or if it might cause other problems.

## Who was studied?

The review included 24 studies of very sick adults in hospitals who needed intensive care.

## What did researchers want to find out?

Researchers wanted to know:
- Does turning patients onto their sides help them survive or recover better?
- Does side positioning help them breathe better?
- Does side positioning cause any harmful effects, like low blood oxygen or low blood pressure?

## What did they find?

Researchers looked at 24 studies but found major problems:
- **No studies** measured whether side positioning helped patients survive
- Only **2 studies** looked at whether it helped with breathing problems, but they didn't provide enough information to draw conclusions
- **22 studies** measured blood oxygen levels and other signs, but the studies were too different from each other to compare fairly
- When researchers combined results from 2 small studies, they found that positioning patients with their ""bad lung"" down resulted in lower blood oxygen than positioning them with their ""good lung"" down

## What does this mean?

The researchers **cannot recommend** whether hospitals should routinely turn patients onto their sides. There isn't enough good evidence to say if side positioning helps or hurts critically ill patients.

## What happens next?

More research is needed to find out if turning patients on their sides actually helps them get better.","### Plain Language Summary

#### What Was the Study About?
When people are very sick and in the hospital, they often need their body positions changed regularly. This can help with breathing and prevent problems from staying in bed too long. However, it's unclear if lying on their side helps them more than other positions. This study looked at whether side-lying (lateral position) helps these patients or not.

#### What Did the Researchers Want to Learn?
The researchers aimed to find out if lying on the side (either right or left) helps with recovery, reduces the risk of problems, or causes any issues like low oxygen levels or blood pressure changes.

#### How Was the Study Done?
The researchers looked at several sources for previous studies. They included studies where patients in critical care were positioned on their side for at least 10 minutes to see if it affected their health outcomes.

#### What Were the Main Findings?
- The study included 24 different reports.
- No study looked specifically at whether sideways positioning affects how long patients live.
- Some studies measured effects on breathing, but data was limited and not clear enough for detailed analysis.
- A few studies suggested that lying with the bad lung down might lower oxygen levels in some patients, but the results were not strong or consistent.

#### What Were the Conclusions?
The researchers couldn't make strong recommendations on whether lying on the side is helpful or not because the studies were not clear or consistent enough. More research is needed to understand if and how side positioning helps critically ill patients.

#### What Should We Do Next?
Future research should investigate if positioning people on their side is beneficial and look into other positions, especially for patients using machines to help them breathe."
"Background
Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common symptom. Non‐prescription, over‐the‐counter (OTC) medicines are frequently recommended as a first‐line treatment, but there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of oral OTC cough preparations for acute cough in children and adults in community settings. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 3 2014), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2014), CINAHL (January 2010 to March 2014), LILACS (January 2010 to March 2014), Web of Science (January 2010 to March 2014) and the UK Department of Health National Research Register (March 2010). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral OTC cough preparations with placebo in children and adults suffering from acute cough in community settings. We considered all cough outcomes; secondary outcomes of interest were adverse effects. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened potentially relevant citations, extracted data and assessed study quality. We performed quantitative analysis where appropriate. 
Main results
Due to the small numbers of trials in each category, the limited quantitative data available and the marked differences between trials in terms of participants, interventions and outcome measurement, we felt that pooling of the results was inappropriate. 
We included 29 trials (19 in adults, 10 in children) involving 4835 people (3799 adults and 1036 children). All studies were placebo‐controlled RCTs. However, assessment of the risk of bias of the included studies was limited by poor reporting, particularly for the earlier studies. 
In the adult studies, six trials compared antitussives with placebo and had variable results. Three trials compared the expectorant guaifenesin with placebo; one indicated significant benefit, whereas the other two did not. One trial found that a mucolytic reduced cough frequency and symptom scores. Two studies examined antihistamine‐decongestant combinations and found conflicting results. Four studies compared other combinations of drugs with placebo and indicated some benefit in reducing cough symptoms. Three trials found that antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. 
In the child studies, antitussives (data from three studies), antihistamines (data from three studies), antihistamine‐decongestants (two studies) and antitussive/bronchodilator combinations (one study) were no more effective than placebo. No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. The results of one trial favoured active treatment with mucolytics over placebo. One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups and both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46% and 56% of children compared to 21% of children in the placebo group. One new trial indicated that three types of honey were more effective than placebo over a three‐day period. 
Twenty‐one studies reported adverse effects. There was a wide range across studies, with higher numbers of adverse effects in participants taking preparations containing antihistamines and dextromethorphan. 
Authors' conclusions
The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution because the number of studies in each category of cough preparations was small. Availability, dosing and duration of use of over‐the‐counter cough medicines vary significantly in different countries. Many studies were poorly reported making assessment of risk of bias difficult and studies were also very different from each other, making evaluation of overall efficacy difficult. There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. This should be taken into account when considering prescribing antihistamines and centrally active antitussive agents in children; drugs that are known to have the potential to cause serious harm.","Over‐the‐counter (OTC) medications for acute cough in children and adults in community settings 
Review question 
We undertook a review to determine the effectiveness of over‐the‐counter cough medicines in reducing cough in children and adults in community settings. We found 29 trials involving 4835 people. 
Background 
Acute cough is a common and troublesome symptom in children and adults suffering from acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Many people self prescribe over‐the‐counter (OTC) cough preparations, and health practitioners often recommend their use for the initial treatment of cough. There is substantial variation between countries in the availability and guidelines for use of many of these preparations. 
Study characteristics 
We identified a broad range of studies of different types of preparations used at different dosages in both adults and children. 
Key results 
The evidence is current up to March 2014. We found no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medications in acute cough. Nineteen studies reported adverse effects of these medications and described infrequent, mainly minor side effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache and drowsiness. 
Quality of the evidence 
The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution because the number of studies in each category of cough preparations was small. Many studies were poorly reported making assessment of risk of bias difficult. While all studies were placebo‐controlled randomised controlled trials only a minority reported their methods of allocation and randomisation and there was lack of reporting of blinding of outcome assessors and whether cough outcome measures were validated. In addition, studies supported by pharmaceutical companies or other providers were more likely to have positive results. Studies were very different from each other in terms of treatment types, treatment duration and outcomes measured, making evaluation of overall effectiveness of OTC cough medicines difficult.","# Plain Language Summary: Over-the-Counter Cough Medicines for Acute Cough

## What was this study about?
Researchers wanted to find out if over-the-counter (OTC) cough medicines that you can buy without a prescription actually work for people with acute cough (sudden, short-term cough). They looked at studies comparing these medicines to placebo (fake medicine with no active ingredient).

## Who was studied?
The review included 29 studies with about 4,835 people total—3,799 adults and 1,036 children. All studies compared OTC cough medicines to placebo.

## What medicines were tested?
Researchers looked at several types of cough medicines:
- **Antitussives** (medicines that suppress cough)
- **Expectorants** (medicines that thin mucus)
- **Antihistamines** (allergy medicines)
- **Decongestants** (medicines that clear nasal passages)
- **Mucolytics** (medicines that break down mucus)
- **Honey**

## What did they find?

**In adults:** Results were mixed. Some medicines showed small benefits, but many showed no difference from placebo.

**In children:** Most medicines (antitussives, antihistamines, and decongestants) did not work better than placebo. Honey showed some benefit over three days. One cough syrup showed improvement compared to placebo.

**Side effects:** 21 studies reported side effects. Medicines with antihistamines and certain cough suppressants had more side effects.

## Bottom line
There is not enough good evidence to say whether OTC cough medicines work. The researchers caution that these medicines should be used carefully, especially in children, since some can cause serious harm.","**Summary of a Study on Over-the-Counter Cough Medicines**

**Purpose of the Study:**
The study looked at whether over-the-counter (OTC) medicines help with coughs caused by colds in children and adults.

**Who Was Studied:**
The study included 4,835 people—3,799 adults and 1,036 children.

**What They Did:**
Researchers compared OTC cough medicines to placebos (sugar pills) to see if the medicines worked. They checked for any side effects too.

**Main Findings:**
- In adults, results for different medicines varied. Some showed a little benefit, while others did not work better than the placebo.
- For children, most OTC medicines did not work better than placebos, except a few like certain types of honey.
- There were more side effects in medicines containing certain ingredients like antihistamines.

**Safety Notes:**
Some medicines might not be safe for children and could cause harm. 

**Conclusion:**
There isn't strong evidence that OTC cough medicines help with coughs from colds. It's important to be cautious when giving these to children."
"Background
Healthcare professionals are important contributors to healthcare quality and patient safety, but their performance does not always follow recommended clinical practice. There are many approaches to influencing practice among healthcare professionals. These approaches include audit and feedback, reminders, educational materials, educational outreach visits, educational meetings or conferences, use of local opinion leaders, financial incentives, and organisational interventions. In this review, we evaluated the effectiveness of patient‐mediated interventions. These interventions are aimed at changing the performance of healthcare professionals through interactions with patients, or through information provided by or to patients. Examples of patient‐mediated interventions include 1) patient‐reported health information, 2) patient information, 3) patient education, 4) patient feedback about clinical practice, 5) patient decision aids, 6) patients, or patient representatives, being members of a committee or board, and 7) patient‐led training or education of healthcare professionals. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of patient‐mediated interventions on healthcare professionals' performance (adherence to clinical practice guidelines or recommendations for clinical practice). 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, Ovid in March 2018, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in March 2017, and ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry (ICTRP) in September 2017, and OpenGrey, the Grey Literature Report and Google Scholar in October 2017. We also screened the reference lists of included studies and conducted cited reference searches for all included studies in October 2017. 
Selection criteria
Randomised studies comparing patient‐mediated interventions to either usual care or other interventions to improve professional practice. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes using Mantel‐Haenszel statistics and the random‐effects model. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) using inverse variance statistics. Two review authors independently assessed the certainty of the evidence (GRADE). 
Main results
We included 25 studies with a total of 12,268 patients. The number of healthcare professionals included in the studies ranged from 12 to 167 where this was reported. The included studies evaluated four types of patient‐mediated interventions: 1) patient‐reported health information interventions (for instance information obtained from patients about patients' own health, concerns or needs before a clinical encounter), 2) patient information interventions (for instance, where patients are informed about, or reminded to attend recommended care), 3) patient education interventions (intended to increase patients' knowledge about their condition and options of care, for instance), and 4) patient decision aids (where the patient is provided with information about treatment options including risks and benefits). For each type of patient‐mediated intervention a separate meta‐analysis was produced. 
Patient‐reported health information interventions probably improve healthcare professionals' adherence to recommended clinical practice (moderate‐certainty evidence). We found that for every 100 patients consulted or treated, 26 (95% CI 23 to 30) are in accordance with recommended clinical practice compared to 17 per 100 in the comparison group (no intervention or usual care). We are uncertain about the effect of patient‐reported health information interventions on desirable patient health outcomes and patient satisfaction (very low‐certainty evidence). Undesirable patient health outcomes and adverse events were not reported in the included studies and resource use was poorly reported. 
Patient information interventions may improve healthcare professionals' adherence to recommended clinical practice (low‐certainty evidence). We found that for every 100 patients consulted or treated, 32 (95% CI 24 to 42) are in accordance with recommended clinical practice compared to 20 per 100 in the comparison group (no intervention or usual care). Patient information interventions may have little or no effect on desirable patient health outcomes and patient satisfaction (low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of patient information interventions on undesirable patient health outcomes because the certainty of the evidence is very low. Adverse events and resource use were not reported in the included studies. 
Patient education interventions probably improve healthcare professionals' adherence to recommended clinical practice (moderate‐certainty evidence). We found that for every 100 patients consulted or treated, 46 (95% CI 39 to 54) are in accordance with recommended clinical practice compared to 35 per 100 in the comparison group (no intervention or usual care). Patient education interventions may slightly increase the number of patients with desirable health outcomes (low‐certainty evidence). Undesirable patient health outcomes, patient satisfaction, adverse events and resource use were not reported in the included studies. 
Patient decision aid interventions may have little or no effect on healthcare professionals' adherence to recommended clinical practice (low‐certainty evidence). We found that for every 100 patients consulted or treated, 32 (95% CI 24 to 43) are in accordance with recommended clinical practice compared to 37 per 100 in the comparison group (usual care). Patient health outcomes, patient satisfaction, adverse events and resource use were not reported in the included studies. 
Authors' conclusions
We found that two types of patient‐mediated interventions, patient‐reported health information and patient education, probably improve professional practice by increasing healthcare professionals' adherence to recommended clinical practice (moderate‐certainty evidence). We consider the effect to be small to moderate. Other patient‐mediated interventions, such as patient information may also improve professional practice (low‐certainty evidence). Patient decision aids may make little or no difference to the number of healthcare professionals' adhering to recommended clinical practice (low‐certainty evidence). 
The impact of these interventions on patient health and satisfaction, adverse events and resource use, is more uncertain mostly due to very low certainty evidence or lack of evidence.","Patient‐mediated interventions to improve professional practice
What is the aim of the review? 
Our aim with this Cochrane review was to assess whether patients can change the performance of healthcare professionals. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 25 studies. 
Key message 
This review suggests that patients may change healthcare professionals’ practice though the following three strategies: 1) strategies where patients give healthcare professionals information about themselves; 2) strategies where patients are given healthcare information; and 3) strategies where patients take part in patient education. Patient decision aids may make little or no difference to healthcare professionals’ practice, however, the certainty is low, and these results should be interpreted carefully. We still need more research about the best ways in which patients can change professional practice and about the impact it has on patients’ health. 
What was studied in the review? 
Many strategies have been tested to see if they can improve healthcare professionals’ practice and make sure that patients receive the best available care. These strategies include sending reminders to healthcare professionals, giving them further education, or giving them financial rewards. These strategies have mostly had only small or moderate effects. Another way of changing what healthcare professionals do is through the patients themselves. These strategies are called 'patient‐mediated interventions'. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The studies in this review assessed different patient‐mediated strategies compared to usual care or no strategies. 
Strategies where patients give information to healthcare professionals 
In these studies, patients gave information about their own health, concerns or needs to the doctor. This was usually done by filling in a questionnaire in the waiting area before a consultation. The doctor was then given this information before or at the consultation. The review shows that these strategies: 
‐ probably improve the extent to which healthcare professionals follow recommended clinical practice (moderate‐certainty evidence). 
We are uncertain about the effect of these strategies on patient health, patient satisfaction and resource use because these outcomes were not measured in the studies or because the certainty of the evidence is very low. 
Strategies where information was given to patients 
In these studies, patients were given information about recommended care or were reminded to use services, for instance to go for a check‐up. The review shows that these strategies: 
‐ may improve the extent to which healthcare professionals follow recommended clinical practice (low‐certainty evidence); 
‐ may have little or no effect on patient satisfaction (low‐certainty evidence);
‐ may have little or no effect on some patient health outcomes, such as the number of patients who reach controlled blood pressure (low‐certainty evidence). However, we are uncertain about the effect of these strategies on other patient health outcomes because the certainty of the evidence is very low. We also lack information to draw conclusions about resource use. 
Patient education strategies 
In these studies, patients took part in patient education such as self‐management programmes, for instance to increase their knowledge about their condition. The review shows that these strategies: 
‐ probably improve the extent to which healthcare professionals follow recommended clinical practice (moderate‐certainty evidence); 
‐ may slightly improve some patient health outcomes such as the number of patients who reach controlled blood pressure (low‐certainty evidence). However, we are uncertain about the effect of these strategies on other patient health outcomes, patient satisfaction and resource use because these outcomes were not measured in the included studies. 
Patient decision aid strategies 
In the one study that assessed effect of patient decision aids, patients were given a decision aid consisting of a booklet, personal worksheet, and audiotape to make decisions about their medical management. The review shows that these strategies: 
‐ may have little or no effect on the extent to which healthcare professionals follow recommended clinical practice (low‐certainty evidence) 
We are uncertain about the effect of these strategies on patient health, patient satisfaction and resource use because these outcomes were not measured in the studies or because the certainty of the evidence is very low. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We searched for studies up to March 2018 and ongoing studies up to October 2017.","# Plain Language Summary: How Patient Involvement Can Help Doctors Follow Best Practices

## What is this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if involving patients can help doctors and nurses follow recommended medical guidelines. They looked at different ways patients can be involved, such as sharing their health information, getting education about their condition, or helping make decisions about treatment.

## What did researchers do?

The researchers searched for studies that tested different patient-involvement methods. They found 25 studies involving about 12,000 patients and up to 167 healthcare workers. They compared what happened when patients were involved versus when they weren't.

## What types of patient involvement were tested?

1. **Patients sharing their own health information** — Patients told doctors about their symptoms or concerns before appointments

2. **Patients getting information** — Doctors reminded patients about recommended care or gave them information

3. **Patients getting education** — Patients learned more about their health condition and treatment choices

4. **Patient decision aids** — Patients received information about treatment options, including risks and benefits

## What did they find?

**Patient education and patient-reported health information worked best.** When patients shared their health information or received education:
- More doctors followed recommended practices
- For every 100 patients, about 46 doctors followed best practices (compared to 35 without patient involvement)

**Patient information also helped, but less strongly.**

**Patient decision aids didn't seem to make much difference** in whether doctors followed guidelines.

## What about patient health and safety?

The studies didn't provide enough information about whether these methods actually improved patient health, satisfaction, or safety. More research is needed on these important topics.","### Study Summary on Improving Healthcare Practices

#### Goal of the Study
The study aims to see if involving patients can help healthcare professionals follow guidelines more effectively.

#### Who Was Studied
The research included 25 studies with 12,268 patients and varied numbers of healthcare professionals (12 to 167).

#### Types of Patient Involvement
1. **Patient-Reported Health Information:** Patients share their health details before meeting with a doctor.
2. **Patient Information:** Patients get reminders or information about their care.
3. **Patient Education:** Educating patients about their health and treatment options.
4. **Patient Decision Aids:** Providing patients with information on treatment choices, including pros and cons.

#### Key Findings
- **Patient-Reported Health Information and Education:** These methods probably help healthcare professionals follow guidelines better.
- **Patient Information:** This might help a little, but evidence is less certain.
- **Patient Decision Aids:** These seem to make little or no difference in how well professionals follow guidelines.

#### What’s Unclear
- The impact on patient health outcomes and satisfaction is uncertain due to a lack of strong evidence.
- Effects on any negative outcomes and how resources are used were not clear in the studies.

#### Conclusion
Involving patients, especially through sharing their health information and educating them, likely aids in proper healthcare practices. The effect on actual health results and satisfaction needs more study."
"Background
General anaesthesia combined with epidural analgesia may have a beneficial effect on clinical outcomes. However, use of epidural analgesia for cardiac surgery is controversial due to a theoretical increased risk of epidural haematoma associated with systemic heparinization. This review was published in 2013, and it was updated in 2019. 
Objectives
To determine the impact of perioperative epidural analgesia in adults undergoing cardiac surgery, with or without cardiopulmonary bypass, on perioperative mortality and cardiac, pulmonary, or neurological morbidity. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in November 2018, and two trial registers up to February 2019, together with references and relevant conference abstracts. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including adults undergoing any type of cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia and comparing epidural analgesia versus another modality of postoperative pain treatment. The primary outcome was mortality. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 69 trials with 4860 participants: 2404 given epidural analgesia and 2456 receiving comparators (systemic analgesia, peripheral nerve block, intrapleural analgesia, or wound infiltration). The mean (or median) age of participants varied between 43.5 years and 74.6 years. Surgeries performed were coronary artery bypass grafting or valvular procedures and surgeries for congenital heart disease. We judged that no trials were at low risk of bias for all domains, and that all trials were at unclear/high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel taking care of study participants. 
Epidural analgesia versus systemic analgesia  
Trials show there may be no difference in mortality at 0 to 30 days (risk difference (RD) 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.01 to 0.01; 38 trials with 3418 participants; low‐quality evidence), and there may be a reduction in myocardial infarction at 0 to 30 days (RD −0.01, 95% CI −0.02 to 0.00; 26 trials with 2713 participants; low‐quality evidence). Epidural analgesia may reduce the risk of 0 to 30 days respiratory depression (RD −0.03, 95% CI −0.05 to −0.01; 21 trials with 1736 participants; low‐quality evidence). There is probably little or no difference in risk of pneumonia at 0 to 30 days (RD −0.03, 95% CI −0.07 to 0.01; 10 trials with 1107 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), and epidural analgesia probably reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter at 0 to 2 weeks (RD −0.06, 95% CI −0.10 to −0.01; 18 trials with 2431 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). There may be no difference in cerebrovascular accidents at 0 to 30 days (RD −0.00, 95% CI −0.01 to 0.01; 18 trials with 2232 participants; very low‐quality evidence), and none of the included trials reported any epidural haematoma events at 0 to 30 days (53 trials with 3982 participants; low‐quality evidence). Epidural analgesia probably reduces the duration of tracheal intubation by the equivalent of 2.4 hours (standardized mean difference (SMD) −0.78, 95% CI −1.01 to −0.55; 40 trials with 3353 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Epidural analgesia reduces pain at rest and on movement up to 72 hours after surgery. At six to eight hours, researchers noted a reduction in pain, equivalent to a reduction of 1 point on a 0 to 10 pain scale (SMD −1.35, 95% CI −1.98 to −0.72; 10 trials with 502 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Epidural analgesia may increase risk of hypotension (RD 0.21, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.33; 17 trials with 870 participants; low‐quality evidence) but may make little or no difference in the need for infusion of inotropics or vasopressors (RD 0.00, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.07; 23 trials with 1821 participants; low‐quality evidence). 
Epidural analgesia versus other comparators  
Fewer studies compared epidural analgesia versus peripheral nerve blocks (four studies), intrapleural analgesia (one study), and wound infiltration (one study). Investigators provided no data for pulmonary complications, atrial fibrillation or flutter, or for any of the comparisons. When reported, other outcomes for these comparisons (mortality, myocardial infarction, neurological complications, duration of tracheal intubation, pain, and haemodynamic support) were uncertain due to the small numbers of trials and participants. 
Authors' conclusions
Compared with systemic analgesia, epidural analgesia may reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, respiratory depression, and atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, as well as the duration of tracheal intubation and pain, in adults undergoing cardiac surgery. There may be little or no difference in mortality, pneumonia, and epidural haematoma, and effects on cerebrovascular accident are uncertain. Evidence is insufficient to show the effects of epidural analgesia compared with peripheral nerve blocks, intrapleural analgesia, or wound infiltration.","Epidural analgesia for heart surgery with or without the heart lung machine in adults
Review question 
We set out to determine from randomized controlled trials the effect of epidural pain relief on the number of deaths following surgery and risk of heart, lung, or nerve complications in adults undergoing heart surgery. 
This review was first published in 2013, and it was updated in 2019.
Background 
For epidural pain relief, a local anaesthetic, an opioid, or a mixture of both drugs is given through a catheter in the epidural space, which is the space immediately outside the membrane surrounding the cord. Epidural analgesia could reduce the risk of complications after surgery, such as lung infections including pneumonia, difficulty in breathing (respiratory failure), heart attack, and irregular heart rhythm caused by atrial fibrillation. A concern is that for cardiac surgery, the blood has to be thinned to reduce blood clotting, which may increase the chance of bleeding around the spinal cord. The collection of blood puts pressure on the spinal cord and can cause permanent nerve damage and disability. 
Study characteristics 
We included randomized controlled trials involving adults undergoing any type of cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia with or without cardiopulmonary bypass where researchers compared epidural pain relief around the time of surgery against other forms of pain relief. Surgeries performed were coronary artery bypass grafting or valvular procedures and surgeries for congenital heart disease. The average age of participants was between 43 and 75 years. Outcomes were measured up to one year after surgery. 
We included 69 studies with 4860 participants. Where stated, the studies were funded by governmental resources (five studies), charity (eight), institutional resources (23), or in part by the industry (two). In all, 31 trials did not mention the source of funding. The evidence is current to November 2018. 
Key results 
When researchers compared epidural analgesia versus systemic pain relief (e.g. by an analgesic given directly into a vein), they could not detect any difference in the number of deaths in the first 30 days after surgery (38 studies, 3418 participants). There might be a difference in the number of people experiencing heart attacks (26 studies, 2713 participants). These findings were supported by low‐quality evidence. We found a small reduction in the risk of respiratory depression with epidural pain relief (21 studies, 1736 participants), but not in the risk of pneumonia (10 studies, 1107 participants) (low‐ or moderate‐quality evidence). The reduced risk of respiratory depression was more obvious when cardiopulmonary bypass was needed for cardiac surgery. Epidural analgesia reduced the risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter early in recovery at zero to two weeks (18 studies, 2431 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). The number of cerebrovascular accidents was not clearly different (18 studies, 2232 participants), and no lasting neurological complications or epidural haematomas were reported (53 studies, 3982 participants; very low‐ or low‐quality evidence). Although epidural analgesia may have reduced the duration of tracheal intubation, this was noted mainly in older studies, and clinical practices have changed since that time (40 trials, 3353 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). 
We found only six studies that compared epidural pain relief versus application of local anaesthetic on the body surface to produce peripheral nerve blocks directly into the space around the lungs (intrapleural analgesia) and onto the surgical wound (wound infiltration). These studies provided low‐ or very low‐quality evidence and did not report on many of the outcomes for this review. Study authors reported no heart attacks and no epidural haematomas. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of evidence as moderate, low, or very low. We included too few participants in our review to rule out any differences in the number of patient deaths between epidural analgesia and systemic analgesia, nor to see any increase in epidural haematomas.","# Plain Language Summary: Pain Relief Methods After Heart Surgery

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether a special pain relief method called ""epidural analgesia"" works well for patients having heart surgery. Epidural analgesia is a way to deliver pain medicine through a small tube placed near the spine. Doctors wanted to know if this method is better than other ways of managing pain after surgery.

## Why is this important?

Heart surgery is a major operation, and patients need good pain control afterward. Some doctors worry that epidural analgesia might cause bleeding problems in heart surgery patients because they receive blood-thinning medicine during the operation. This review examined whether epidural analgesia is actually safe and helpful.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at 69 different studies involving 4,860 patients who had heart surgery. About half received epidural analgesia, and the other half received different types of pain relief (like pain medicine through an IV or nerve blocks).

## What did they find?

**Good news:**
- Epidural analgesia reduced pain better than other methods
- Patients needed less time on a breathing machine (about 2.4 hours less)
- It may lower the risk of heart rhythm problems
- It may reduce breathing problems after surgery
- **No cases of dangerous bleeding were reported**

**Similar results:**
- Death rates were about the same
- Pneumonia rates were about the same
- Stroke risk was about the same

**Possible concern:**
- Low blood pressure happened more often with epidural analgesia

## Bottom line

For heart surgery patients, epidural analgesia appears to be a safe option that provides better pain relief and may help patients recover faster, without the serious bleeding risks doctors once worried about.","### Plain Language Summary

#### What Is the Study About?

This study looks at how a type of pain control, called epidural analgesia, affects people having heart surgery. It checks if it helps with recovery and safety compared to other pain treatments.

#### Who Took Part?

The study involved 4,860 adults having different types of heart surgeries. These included bypass and valve surgeries, and surgeries for heart problems present from birth. Participants were between 43.5 and 74.6 years old.

#### What Did They Do?

Researchers compared epidural analgesia with other pain treatments like regular pain medication and different ways to block pain.

#### What Did They Find?

- **Mortality (Death Rates):** No difference in death rates within 30 days after surgery.
- **Heart Problems:** Epidural may lower the chance of heart attacks and heart rhythm issues after surgery.
- **Breathing Issues:** There might be a lower risk of breathing problems with epidurals.
- **Pneumonia:** Probably no difference in the chance of getting pneumonia.
- **Stroke:** Effects on stroke risk are unsure.
- **Pain and Recovery:** Epidural helped lower pain after surgery and reduced time on breathing machines by a couple of hours.
- **Blood Pressure:** Epidurals might increase the risk of low blood pressure.

#### How Reliable Are These Results?

The results vary in quality from low to moderate. This means some findings might not be very strong, and more research is needed, especially comparing epidurals with other pain treatments.

#### Conclusion

Epidurals might help with some heart surgery recovery aspects, but more studies are needed to know for sure, especially compared to other pain relief methods."
"Background
Systemic corticosteroid therapy is central to the management of acute asthma. The use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) may also be beneficial in this setting. 
Objectives
To determine the benefit of ICS for the treatment of patients with acute asthma managed in the emergency department (ED). 
Search methods
We identified controlled clinical trials from the Cochrane Airways Group specialised register of controlled trials. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews, and texts also were searched. The latest search was September 2012. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. Studies were included if patients presented to the ED or its equivalent with acute asthma, and were treated with ICS or placebo, in addition to standard therapy. Two review authors independently selected potentially relevant articles, and then independently selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two review authors. There were three different types of studies that were included in this review: 1) studies comparing ICS vs. placebo, with no systemic corticosteroids given to either treatment group, 2) studies comparing ICS vs. placebo, with systemic corticosteroids given to both treatment groups, and 3) studies comparing ICS alone versus systemic corticosteroids. For the analysis, the first two types of studies were included as separate subgroups in the primary analysis (ICS vs. placebo), while the third type of study was included in the secondary analysis (ICS vs. systemic corticosteroid). 
Data collection and analysis
Data were extracted independently by two review authors if the authors were unable to verify the validity of extracted information. Missing data were obtained from the authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper. Where appropriate, individual and pooled dichotomous outcomes were reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate, individual and pooled continuous outcomes were reported as mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs. The primary analysis employed a fixed‐effect model and a random‐effects model was used for sensitivity analysis. Heterogeneity is reported using I‐squared (I2) statistics. 
Main results
Twenty trials were selected for inclusion in the primary analysis (13 paediatric, seven adult), with a total number of 1403 patients. Patients treated with ICS were less likely to be admitted to hospital (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.62; 12 studies; 960 patients) and heterogeneity (I2 = 27%) was modest. This represents a reduction from 32 to 17 hospital admissions per 100 patients treated with ICS in comparison with placebo. Subgroup analysis of hospital admissions based on concomitant systemic corticosteroid use revealed that both subgroups indicated benefit from ICS in reducing hospital admissions (ICS and systemic corticosteroid versus systemic corticosteroid: OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.81; 5 studies; N = 433; ICS versus placebo: OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.52; 7 studies; N = 527). However, there was moderate heterogeneity in the subgroup using ICS in addition to systemic steroids (I2 = 52%). Patients receiving ICS demonstrated small, significant improvements in peak expiratory flow (PEF: MD 7%; 95% CI 3% to 11%) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1: MD 6%; 95% CI 2% to 10%) at three to four hours post treatment). Only a small number of studies reported these outcomes such that they could be included in the meta‐analysis and most of the studies in this comparison did not administer systemic corticosteroids to either treatment group. There was no evidence of significant adverse effects from ICS treatment with regard to tremor or nausea and vomiting. In the secondary analysis of studies comparing ICS alone versus systemic corticosteroid alone, heterogeneity among the studies complicated pooling of data or drawing reliable conclusions. 
Authors' conclusions
ICS therapy reduces hospital admissions in patients with acute asthma who are not treated with oral or intravenous corticosteroids. They may also reduce admissions when they are used in addition to systemic corticosteroids; however, the most recent evidence is conflicting. There is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy results in clinically important changes in pulmonary function or clinical scores when used in acute asthma in addition to systemic corticosteroids. Also, there is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy can be used in place of systemic corticosteroid therapy when treating acute asthma. Further research is needed to clarify the most appropriate drug dosage and delivery device, and to define which patients are most likely to benefit from ICS therapy. Use of similar measures and reporting methods of lung function, and a common, validated, clinical score would be helpful in future versions of this meta‐analysis.","Early use of inhaled corticosteroids in the emergency department treatment of acute asthma 
Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in the world. It is estimated that 300 million people of all ages, and all ethnic backgrounds, suffer from asthma, with 1 in every 250 deaths worldwide attributed to asthma. In an asthma attack, the airways (passages to the lungs) narrow from muscle spasm and swelling (inflammation). Corticosteroid drugs can be used to reduce the swelling. Corticosteroids can be inhaled, or taken systemically by mouth (orally) or through a drip into the veins (intravenously). 
Standard treatment for asthma attacks is to administer beta2‐agonists (to open up the airways) and systemic corticosteroids (to reduce the inflammation). The purpose of this review was to determine if the use of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) agents is beneficial in emergency department treatment settings. A total of 90 studies were identified for this review; 20 were deemed relevant and selected for inclusion (13 paediatric, 7 adult), with a total number of 1403 patients. 
This review found that inhaled corticosteroids used alone or in combination with systemic corticosteroids helped to relieve asthma attacks, were well tolerated and had few side effects. However, the most effective drug and dosage are unclear. The studies in the review included a variety of ICSmedications: beclomethasone (Beclovent/Becloforte/QVAR), budesonide (Pulmicort), dexamethasone sodium phosphate, fluticasone propionate (Flovent or Flixotide), Flunisolide (Aerobid) and triamcinolone (Azmacort). The review also found that ICS administered in this setting resulted in fewer hospital admissions. There was a reduction from 32 to 17 hospital admissions per hundred patients treated with ICS agents compared with placebo. At this time there is insufficient evidence to support using ICS agents alone as a replacement for systemic corticosteroid therapy in acute asthma attacks 
However, there are many unanswered questions about the use of ICS in the emergency department treatment setting. Future research should focus on optimal dosage, dosage frequency and delivery device, identification of effective ICS agents, clearly defined outcomes (such as admissions criteria, pulmonary function testing and follow‐up after discharge from emergency departments).","# Plain Language Summary: Inhaled Corticosteroids for Acute Asthma in the Emergency Department

## What is this study about?
This review looked at whether inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)—a type of asthma medicine breathed in through the mouth—help people having a severe asthma attack in the emergency department. Doctors already use other types of steroids to treat acute asthma, but researchers wanted to know if adding or using ICS could help too.

## Who was studied?
The review included 20 different research studies with a total of 1,403 patients (both children and adults) who came to the emergency department with acute asthma.

## What did researchers do?
Researchers compared two groups of patients:
- One group received ICS (inhaled corticosteroids)
- The other group received a placebo (fake medicine) or different steroids

They looked at whether patients needed to be admitted to the hospital and whether their lung function improved.

## What did they find?
**Hospital admissions:** Patients who received ICS were much less likely to need hospital admission. Instead of 32 out of 100 patients needing admission, only 17 out of 100 needed admission when treated with ICS.

**Lung function:** Patients receiving ICS showed small improvements in how well their lungs worked a few hours after treatment.

**Side effects:** There were no serious side effects reported from ICS treatment.

## What does this mean?
ICS can help reduce hospital admissions for people with acute asthma, especially when other steroids are not being used. However, more research is needed to figure out the best dose, how to deliver the medicine, and which patients benefit the most.","**Study Summary on Inhaled Corticosteroids for Asthma in the Emergency Room**

**Purpose:**  
This study looked at how well inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) work for people with sudden asthma attacks in the emergency room.

**Who Was Involved:**  
Researchers studied 20 trials with a total of 1403 patients, including both children and adults.

**What Happened:**  
Patients were given either ICS or a placebo, alongside their usual treatment. Some also received traditional steroid treatments.

**Findings:**  
- People who used ICS were less likely to be admitted to the hospital. If 100 people used ICS, 17 were admitted, compared to 32 who got a placebo.
- Both people using just ICS and those using ICS with traditional steroids benefited from reduced hospital admissions.
- Some improvements were seen in breathing tests, but not enough information was available to say how much it helps overall.

**Safety:**  
Using ICS did not show any major side effects like shaking or nausea.

**Conclusions:**  
ICS may help reduce hospital stays for sudden asthma attacks, whether used alone or with other steroids, but more studies are needed to know the best way to use them. Future research should find the best dosage and who will benefit the most."
"Background
Cardenolides are naturally occurring plant toxins which act primarily on the heart. While poisoning with the digitalis cardenolides (digoxin and digitoxin) are reported worldwide, cardiotoxicity from other cardenolides such as the yellow oleander are also a major problem, with tens of thousands of cases of poisoning each year in South Asia. Because cardenolides from these plants are structurally similar, acute poisonings are managed using similar treatments. The benefit of these treatments is of interest, particularly in the context of cost since most poisonings occur in developing countries where resources are very limited. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy of antidotes for the treatment of acute cardenolide poisoning, in particular atropine, isoprenaline (isoproterenol), multiple‐dose activated charcoal (MDAC), fructose‐1,6‐diphosphate, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium, phenytoin and anti‐digoxin Fab antitoxin. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Controlled Trials Register of the Cochrane Collaboration, Current Awareness in Clinical Toxicology, Info Trac, www.google.com.au, and Science Citation Index of studies identified by the previous searches. We manually searched the bibliographies of identified articles and personally contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials where antidotes were administered to patients with acute symptomatic cardenolide poisoning were identified. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently extracted data on study design, including the method of randomisation, participant characteristics, type of intervention and outcomes from each study. We independently assessed methodological quality of the included studies. A pooled analysis was not appropriate. 
Main results
Two randomised controlled trials were identified, both were conducted in patients with yellow oleander poisoning. One trial investigated the effect of MDAC on mortality, the relative risk (RR) was 0.31 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.83) indicating a beneficial effect. The second study found a beneficial effect of anti‐digoxin Fab antitoxin on the presence of cardiac dysrhythmias at two hours post‐administration; the RR was 0.60 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.81). Other benefits were also noted in both studies and serious adverse effects were minimal. Studies assessing the effect of antidotes on other cardenolides were not identified. One ongoing study investigating the activated charcoal for acute yellow oleander self‐poisoning was also identified. 
Authors' conclusions
There is some evidence to suggest that MDAC and anti‐digoxin Fab antitoxin may be effective treatments for yellow oleander poisoning. However, the efficacy and indications of these interventions for the treatment of acute digitalis poisoning is uncertain due to the lack of good quality controlled clinical trials. Given pharmacokinetic differences between individual cardenolides, the effect of antidotes administered to patients with yellow oleander poisoning cannot be readily translated to those of other cardenolides. Unfortunately cost limits the use of antidotes such as anti‐digoxin Fab antitoxin in developing countries where cardenolide poisonings are frequent. More research is required using relatively cheap antidotes which may also be effective.","Antidotes for acute cardenolide (cardiac glycoside) poisoning

## What is this study about?

This review looked at treatments for poisoning from certain plants that contain toxic substances called cardenolides. These plants include yellow oleander and digitalis plants. Poisoning from these plants happens thousands of times each year, especially in South Asia where people have limited access to medical care and expensive medicines.

## Why does this matter?

When someone is poisoned by these plants, their heart can be seriously affected. Doctors need to know which treatments actually work and which ones are affordable for countries with fewer resources.

## What did researchers do?

Scientists searched medical databases and journals to find studies that tested different treatments for this type of poisoning. They looked for studies where some patients received a treatment and others did not, so they could fairly compare results.

## What did they find?

Researchers found only two good-quality studies, both involving yellow oleander poisoning:

- **Study 1**: A treatment called multiple-dose activated charcoal reduced deaths (it lowered the death risk by about 69%)
- **Study 2**: A medicine called anti-digoxin Fab antitoxin helped reduce heart rhythm problems within two hours after treatment

Both studies showed these treatments were helpful and caused few serious side effects.

## What's the bottom line?

These two treatments show promise for yellow oleander poisoning, but more research is needed. We don't know yet if they work the same way for other plant poisons. The biggest problem is that the most effective treatments are very expensive and not available in developing countries where poisonings happen most often.","### Plain Language Summary

#### What's the Study About?
This study looks at how well certain treatments work for people who have been poisoned by plants that affect the heart. These plant toxins, like yellow oleander, cause a lot of poisonings, especially in South Asia. The study wants to find out if treatments are helpful since they can be expensive in places where money is tight.

#### Who is Involved?
The study focused on people who got sick from yellow oleander poisoning. It looked at two main treatments and their effects on the heart.

#### What Treatments Were Tested?
1. **Multiple-Dose Activated Charcoal (MDAC):** This is used to absorb poison in the stomach. A study showed it could help reduce the risk of death.
2. **Anti-digoxin Fab Antitoxin:** This treatment helps the heart beat normally after poisoning. It was found to work well in reducing heart problems.

#### What Were the Results?
- **MDAC** helped lower the chance of dying from yellow oleander poisoning.
- **Anti-digoxin Fab Antitoxin** helped improve heart function soon after it was given. Both treatments showed benefits and didn’t have many serious side effects.

#### What's the Conclusion?
MDAC and anti-digoxin Fab antitoxin might be good treatments for yellow oleander poisoning. But, we don't know if they work as well for poisonings from other similar plants. Since these treatments can be costly, more research is needed to find cheaper options.

#### What’s Next?
We need more studies to figure out cheaper and effective ways to treat plant poisonings, as current treatments are too expensive for many countries where these poisonings happen a lot."
"Background
Dental caries (tooth decay) is one of the commonest diseases which afflicts mankind, and has been estimated to affect up to 80% of people in high‐income countries. Caries adversely affects and progressively destroys the tissues of the tooth, including the dental pulp (nerve), leaving teeth unsightly, weakened and with impaired function. The treatment of lesions of dental caries, which are progressing through dentine and have caused the formation of a cavity, involves the provision of dental restorations (fillings). This review updates the previous version published in 2009. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of adhesive bonding on the in‐service performance and longevity of dental amalgam restorations. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 21 January 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 12), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 21 January 2016) and EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 21 January 2016). We also searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en) (both to 21 January 2016) for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing adhesively bonded versus traditional non‐bonded amalgam restorations in conventional preparations utilising deliberate retention, in adults with permanent molar and premolar teeth suitable for Class I and II amalgam restorations only. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed the risk of bias in the included study. 
Main results
One trial with 31 patients who received 113 restorations was included. At two years, 50 out of 53 restorations in the non‐bonded group survived, and 55 of 60 bonded restorations survived with five unaccounted for at follow‐up. Post‐insertion sensitivity was not significantly different (P > 0.05) at baseline or two‐year follow‐up. No fractures of tooth tissue were reported and there was no significant difference between the groups or matched pairs of restorations in their marginal adaptation (P > 0.05). 
Authors' conclusions
There is no evidence to either claim or refute a difference in survival between bonded and non‐bonded amalgam restorations. This review only found one under‐reported trial. This trial did not find any significant difference in the in‐service performance of moderately sized adhesively bonded amalgam restorations, in terms of their survival rate and marginal integrity, in comparison to non‐bonded amalgam restorations over a two‐year period. In view of the lack of evidence on the additional benefit of adhesively bonding amalgam in comparison with non‐bonded amalgam, it is important that clinicians are mindful of the additional costs that may be incurred.","Adhesively or non‐adhesively bonded amalgam restorations for dental caries
Review question 
Does adding adhesive designed to bond dental amalgam fillings to teeth make the fillings perform better and last longer than fillings without it? 
Background 
Tooth decay is a common problem affecting both children and adults. Cavities form in the teeth by the action of acid produced by bacteria present in dental plaque or biofilm. 
A number of techniques and a variety of materials can be used to restore or fill teeth affected by decay. One of the most commonly used and comparatively cheap filling materials is dental amalgam (a mixture of mercury and metal alloy particles). The review authors sought to evaluate the added benefit of using an adhesive to bond amalgam to tooth structure to see if bonded fillings would last longer and perform better. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence in this review, carried out by authors from the Cochrane Oral Health Group, is up to date as of 21 January 2016. One trial with 31 participants (21 male, 10 female) who received 113 restorations was included. The study took place in the UK in a university dental hospital environment. Participants were chosen who were suitable for routine dental treatment. The comparison made was between teeth in the same person on opposite sides of the mouth, one treated with the bonded technique, the other without. At two years no difference was found. 
Key results 
Only one study, which provided limited information, showed that for medium sized fillings there was no difference in sensitivity between the bonded and non‐bonded fillings after their placement and that bonding of amalgam to tooth did not have any effect on the survival of the filling over a two‐year period. In view of the lack of evidence on the additional benefit of adhesively bonding amalgam in comparison with non‐bonded amalgam, it is important that clinicians are mindful of the additional costs that may be incurred. 
There is a wide range of bonding agents developed over a number of years that are available for use by dentists. It is therefore very disappointing that there is such a lack of suitable trials of their effectiveness. 
Quality of the evidence 
There was only one included study and it provides insufficient evidence that adhesively bonded amalgam restorations perform any better than non‐adhesively bonded amalgam restoration when followed up for two years. 
The quality of the evidence is low. In addition, the university dental clinic setting may mean that the participants are not representative of the general population and the treatment offered not typical of that in general dental practice so the results may not be generalisable.","# Plain Language Summary: Dental Fillings and Bonding Adhesive

## What is this study about?

This study looked at whether using a special bonding adhesive on dental fillings makes them last longer and work better.

## Background

Tooth decay is a very common problem that affects many people. When a tooth gets a cavity, dentists fill it with a material called amalgam (a silver-colored filling). Researchers wanted to know if adding a special glue (adhesive) to these fillings helps them stay in place better and last longer.

## What did researchers do?

Scientists searched for studies that compared two types of amalgam fillings:
- Fillings with bonding adhesive attached
- Regular fillings without adhesive

They looked for studies that tested these fillings in adults' back teeth (molars and premolars).

## What did they find?

The researchers found only **one study** with 31 patients who received 113 fillings total.

**After 2 years:**
- Regular fillings (without adhesive): 50 out of 53 survived
- Bonded fillings (with adhesive): 55 out of 60 survived

**Other results:**
- Tooth sensitivity was the same in both groups
- No tooth damage occurred in either group
- The edges of both types of fillings fit equally well

## Conclusion

There is **not enough evidence** to say whether bonding adhesive actually helps fillings last longer. The one study found no real difference between the two types. Because adhesive costs extra money, dentists should think carefully about whether it's worth the added expense.","### Plain Language Summary

**Purpose of the Study:**  
This study looked at whether using a special glue (adhesive bonding) can make silver-colored dental fillings (called amalgam restorations) last longer.

**Who Was in the Study:**  
The study included adults with permanent teeth needing certain types of fillings on their molar and premolar teeth.

**What They Did:**  
Researchers compared two types of fillings: those with adhesive bonding and those without.

**Study Details:**  
- 31 patients participated.
- A total of 113 fillings were checked over two years.

**What They Found:**  
- After two years, almost all fillings in both groups were still in place.
- There was no noticeable difference in pain or how well the fillings fit in the teeth between the two groups.
- No teeth broke in either group.

**What This Means:**  
The study didn't show clear proof that using adhesive bonding makes fillings last longer or stay in place better compared to fillings without it. Since there's no strong evidence suggesting a benefit to using adhesive bonding, dentists should consider the extra cost.

**Safety and Timing:**  
The study took place over two years, and there were no safety issues reported."
"Background
The World Health Organization (WHO) in 2015 stated atovaquone‐proguanil can be used in travellers, and is an option in malaria‐endemic areas in combination with artesunate, as an alternative treatment where first‐line artemisinin‐based combination therapy (ACT) is not available or effective. This review is an update of a Cochrane Review undertaken in 2005. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of atovaquone‐proguanil (alone and in combination with artemisinin drugs) versus other antimalarial drugs for treating uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in adults and children. 
Search methods
The date of the last trial search was 30 January 2020. Search locations for published trials included the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. To include recently published and unpublished trials, we also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the metaRegister of Controlled Trials and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting efficacy and safety data for atovaquone‐proguanil or atovaquone‐proguanil with a partner drug compared with at least one other antimalarial drug for treating uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum infection. 
Data collection and analysis
For this update, two review authors re‐extracted data and assessed certainty of evidence. We meta‐analyzed data to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for treatment failures between comparisons, and for safety outcomes between and across comparisons. Outcome measures include unadjusted treatment failures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)‐adjusted treatment failures. PCR adjustment differentiates new infection from recrudescent infection. 
Main results
Seventeen RCTs met our inclusion criteria providing 4763 adults and children from Africa, South‐America, and South‐East Asia. Eight trials reported PCR‐adjusted data to distinguish between new and recrudescent infection during the follow‐up period. In this abstract, we report only the comparisons against the three WHO‐recommended antimalarials which were included within these trials. 
There were two comparisons with artemether‐lumefantrine, one trial from 2008 in Ethiopia with 60 participants had two failures with atovaquone‐proguanil compared to none with artemether‐lumefantrine (PCR‐adjusted treatment failures at day 28). A second trial from 2012 in Colombia with 208 participants had one failure in each arm (PCR‐adjusted treatment failures at day 42). 
There was only one comparison with artesunate‐amodiaquine from a 2014 trial conducted in Cameroon. There were six failures with atovaquone‐proguanil at day 28 and two with artesunate‐amodiaquine (PCR‐adjusted treatment failures at day 28: 9.4% with atovaquone‐proguanil compared to 2.9% with artesunate‐amodiaquine; RR 3.19, 95% CI 0.67 to 15.22; 1 RCT, 132 participants; low‐certainty evidence), although there was a similar number of PCR‐unadjusted treatment failures (9 (14.1%) with atovaquone‐proguanil and 8 (11.8%) with artesunate‐amodiaquine; RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.91; 1 RCT, 132 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
There were two comparisons with artesunate‐mefloquine from a 2012 trial in Colombia and a 2002 trial in Thailand where there are high levels of multi‐resistant malaria. There were similar numbers of PCR‐adjusted treatment failures between groups at day 42 (2.7% with atovaquone‐proguanil compared to 2.4% with artesunate‐mefloquine; RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.34; 2 RCTs, 1168 participants; high‐certainty evidence). There were also similar PCR‐unadjusted treatment failures between groups (5.3% with atovaquone‐proguanil compared to 6.6% with artesunate‐mefloquine; RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.3; 1 RCT, 1063 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
When atovaquone‐proguanil was combined with artesunate, there were fewer treatment failures with and without PCR‐adjustment at day 28 (PCR‐adjusted treatment failures at day 28: 2.16% with atovaquone‐proguanil compared to no failures with artesunate‐atovaquone‐proguanil; RR 5.14, 95% CI 0.61 to 43.52; 2 RCTs, 375 participants, low‐certainty evidence) and day 42 (PCR‐adjusted treatment failures at day 42: 3.82% with atovaquone‐proguanil compared to 2.05% with artesunate‐atovaquone‐proguanil (RR 1.84, 95% CI 0.95 to 3.56; 2 RCTs, 1258 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). In the 2002 trial in Thailand, there were fewer treatment failures in the artesunate‐atovaquone‐proguanil group compared to the atovaquone‐proguanil group at day 42 with PCR‐adjustment. 
Whilst there were some small differences in which adverse events were more frequent in the atovaquone‐proguanil groups compared to comparator drugs, there were no recurrent associations to suggest that atovaquone‐proguanil is strongly associated with any specific adverse event. 
Authors' conclusions
Atovaquone‐proguanil was effective against uncomplicated P falciparum malaria, although in some instances treatment failure rates were between 5% and 10%. The addition of artesunate to atovaquone‐proguanil may reduce treatment failure rates. Artesunate‐atovaquone‐proguanil and the development of parasite resistance may represent an area for further research.","What are the benefits and risks of atovaquone‐proguanil for treating uncomplicated malaria caused by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite? 
What is the aim of this review? 
The most common, and most serious, type of malaria is caused by Plasmodium falciparum. In its mild (uncomplicated) form, the symptoms are fever, headaches, muscle pain, and vomiting. The disease can become severe and life‐threatening if it is not treated soon enough or with the right medicines. 
This review aimed to find out whether atovaquone‐proguanil is effective and safe for treating uncomplicated cases of P falciparum malaria. We aimed to achieve this by comparing the results of studies that had compared atovaquone‐proguanil to other malaria treatments. 
Key messages 
Atovaquone‐proguanil is as effective for treating uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria as artesunate‐mefloquine. It may be less effective than artemether‐lumefantrine, artesunate‐amodiaquine, and artesunate‐atovaquone‐proguanil, though more robust evidence is needed to confirm this. Side effects seem similar with atovaquone‐proguanil. 
What was studied in this review? 
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends treating uncomplicated malaria with oral (by mouth) artemisinin‐based combination medicines (called ACTs). 
ACTs are not always available worldwide and, in some places, Plasmodium falciparum is becoming resistant to recommended treatments (the medicines stop working). We looked at the evidence about the benefits and harms of combinations of medicines that are not artemisinin‐based, but contain atovaquone‐proguanil. This is an oral treatment commonly used by people from non‐malaria areas to prevent them catching malaria when they travel to malaria areas. We wanted to find out whether it works as well for treating uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria as ACTs and other malaria treatments. 
We searched for randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared atovaquone‐proguanil against other malaria treatments. These studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We compared results, summarized the evidence, and rated our confidence in the evidence. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found 17 studies involving 4763 adults and children in Africa, South America, and South East Asia. People were followed for 28 days to one year. 
Fifteen studies compared atovaquone‐proguanil against 12 different antimalarial treatments (ACTs in five studies; other therapies that combined several medicines in two studies; single medicines in nine studies). 
Five studies compared atovaquone‐proguanil plus another medicine (artesunate or chloroquine) against atovaquone‐proguanil alone (three studies); atovaquone‐proguanil plus a different medicine (one study); a combination of therapies that did not include atovaquone‐proguanil (one study); or single medicines (two studies). 
In 15 studies, the researchers and people who were treated knew which medicines participants received. Pharmaceutical companies funded 10 studies. 
Atovaquone‐proguanil against ACTs recommended by the WHO 
Atovaquone‐proguanil may work less well to clear Plasmodiumfalciparum parasites from the blood or prevent them from returning (treatment success) than artemether‐lumefantrine (rates of success compared 28 and 42 days after treatment; one study). However this evidence was based on one small study. 
Atovaquone‐proguanil may work as well as, or less well than, artesunate‐amodiaquine depending on whether new infections appearing after the start of treatment were counted or not (rates of success compared three and 28 days after treatment; one study). However this evidence was based on one small study of children aged under five years. 
When new infections after the start of treatment were excluded, there is strong evidence of little to no difference in treatment success between atovaquone‐proguanil and artesunate‐mefloquine after 42 days (two studies). When new infections were counted, atovaquone‐proguanil may be better than artesunate‐mefloquine, but this evidence was based on the imprecise results of one study. 
Atovaquone‐proguanil against atovaquone‐proguanil plus artesunate 
Compared to atovaquone‐proguanil plus artesunate, atovaquone‐proguanil may be less successful at treating uncomplicated malaria after three and 28 days, however this evidence is based on the results of two small studies. It is probably less successful at treating uncomplicated malaria after 42 days (two studies). 
Side effects 
Studies reported several side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, or headaches. Overall, they were similar between groups. 
How‐up‐to date is this review? 
The evidence is current to 30 January 2020.","# Plain Language Summary: Atovaquone-Proguanil for Malaria Treatment

## What is this study about?

This review looked at how well a malaria medicine called atovaquone-proguanil works compared to other malaria drugs. Researchers wanted to know if it works well and is safe for treating uncomplicated malaria (a type of malaria that doesn't cause severe complications).

## Who was studied?

The review included 17 different research studies with a total of 4,763 adults and children from Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia.

## What treatments were compared?

Researchers compared atovaquone-proguanil (used alone or combined with another drug called artesunate) against other standard malaria medicines recommended by the World Health Organization.

## What did they find?

**When atovaquone-proguanil was used alone:**
- It worked about as well as other standard malaria drugs
- In some cases, about 5-10 out of every 100 people still had malaria after treatment

**When atovaquone-proguanil was combined with artesunate:**
- Fewer people had treatment failures (meaning the medicine worked better)
- This combination may be more effective than atovaquone-proguanil alone

**Side effects:**
- No serious safety concerns were found
- Side effects were similar across all treatment groups

## Bottom line

Atovaquone-proguanil is an effective malaria treatment. Adding artesunate to it may make it work even better. More research is needed to confirm these findings.","### Summary of the Study

**Purpose of the Study**
This study looked at how well a medicine called atovaquone-proguanil works to treat a type of malaria. Researchers wanted to see how it compared to other malaria medicines when used alone or with another drug called artesunate.

**Who Was Involved**
The study included 4,763 adults and children from Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia.

**What They Did**
- Researchers reviewed past trials and collected data on atovaquone-proguanil and its combination with other malaria drugs.
- They checked how often the treatments failed and noted any side effects.

**Key Findings**
- Some trials showed that atovaquone-proguanil had a 5% to 10% rate of treatment failure.
- Combining it with artesunate might lower these failure rates.
- Atovaquone-proguanil was generally safe with no major side effects.

**Conclusion**
Atovaquone-proguanil is effective against malaria but adding artesunate might improve results. More research is needed to fully understand these effects.

**Safety**
There were no strong links between atovaquone-proguanil and specific side effects."
"Background
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is carbohydrate intolerance first recognised during pregnancy and associated with complications for mothers and babies. Probiotics are naturally occurring micro‐organisms, which when ingested in adequate amounts, may confer health benefits. Evidence of the role of probiotics as treatment for GDM is limited. 
Objectives
To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of probiotics in treating women with GDM on maternal and infant outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (24 July 2019), and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of probiotics versus placebo/standard care for the treatment of GDM. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, checked data accuracy, and assessed risk of bias of included trials. The certainty of evidence for selected maternal and infant/child outcomes was assessed using GRADE. 
Main results
Nine RCTs (695 pregnant women with GDM) comparing probiotics versus placebo were identified. The overall risk of bias in the nine RCTs was low to unclear and the evidence was downgraded for imprecision due to the small numbers of women participating in the trials. The trials were carried out in hospitals and universities in Iran (seven trials), Thailand (one trial) and Ireland (one trial). All trials compared probiotics with placebo. 
Maternal outcomes 
We are uncertain if probiotics have any effect compared with placebo on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, (risk ratio (RR) 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 3.53; participants = 256; studies = 3; low‐certainty evidence) and mode of birth as caesareans (average RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.35; participants = 267; studies = 3; low‐certainty evidence) because the certainty of evidence is low and the 95% CIs span possible benefit and possible harm. 
No trials reported primary outcomes of: mode of birth as vaginal/assisted and subsequent development of type 2 diabetes. 
We are uncertain if probiotics have any effect compared with placebo on induction of labour (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.37; participants = 127; studies = 1; very low‐certainty evidence). 
For other secondary maternal outcomes, we are uncertain if there are differences between probiotics and placebo for: postpartum haemorrhage; weight gain during pregnancy intervention and total gestational weight gain; fasting plasma glucose and need for extra pharmacotherapy (insulin). Probiotics may be associated with a slight reduction in triglycerides and total cholesterol. 
In probiotics compared with placebo, there was evidence of reduction in markers for insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR) and HOMA‐B; and insulin secretion. There was also an increase in quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI). 
Probiotics were associated with minor benefits in relevant bio‐markers with evidence of a reduction in inflammatory markers high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (hs‐CRP), interleukin 6 (IL‐6), and marker of oxidative stress malondialdehyde; and an increase in antioxidant total glutathione, but we are uncertain if there is any difference in total antioxidant capacity. 
No trials reported secondary outcomes: perineal trauma, postnatal weight retention or return to pre‐pregnancy weight and postnatal depression. 
Infant/child/adult outcomes 
We are uncertain if probiotics have any effect, compared with placebo, on the risk of large‐for‐gestational‐age babies (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.52; participants = 174; studies = 2; low‐certainty evidence) or infant hypoglycaemia (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.84; participants = 177; studies = 3; low‐certainty evidence) because the certainty of evidence is low and the 95% CIs span possible benefit and possible harm. 
No trials reported primary outcomes of: perinatal (fetal/neonatal) mortality; or neurosensory disability. 
For other secondary outcomes, we are uncertain if there is any difference between probiotics and placebo in gestational age at birth, preterm birth, macrosomia, birthweight, head circumference, length, infant hypoglycaemia, and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions. 
There was evidence of a reduction in infant hyperbilirubinaemia with probiotics compared with placebo. 
No trials reported secondary outcomes: infant adiposity, and later childhood adiposity.
There were no adverse events reported by any of the trials.
Authors' conclusions
Low‐certainty evidence means we are not certain if there is any difference between probiotic and placebo groups in maternal hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, caesareans; and large‐for‐gestational‐age babies. 
There were no adverse events reported by the trials.
Due to the variability of probiotics used and small sample sizes of trials, evidence from this review has limited ability to inform practice. Well‐designed adequately‐powered trials are needed to identify whether probiotics may improve maternal blood glucose levels and/or infant/child/adult outcomes; and whether they can be used to treat GDM.","Probiotics as an added treatment for gestational diabetes to improve mother and baby outcomes 
What is the issue? 
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is carbohydrate intolerance resulting in high blood glucose levels, first recognised during pregnancy. Pregnant women with GDM are at risk of high blood pressure, labour induction, and caesareans. Their babies are at risk of being born large, birth difficulties, respiratory distress, low blood glucose at birth and jaundice that can cause brain injury. There is increased risks of having long‐term diabetes in the mother, and the baby being overweight. Probiotics are micro‐organisms naturally in food and are in fermented milk, yogurt, or capsules. There are many different probiotics; the two most used are Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, and if consumed in adequate amounts may confer health benefits. 
Why is this important? 
Probiotics need to be safe and maternal blood glucose levels carefully managed during pregnancy. 
Women with GDM may receive dietary and physical activity education with monitoring blood glucose levels as initial management. When blood glucose levels are above a certain threshold, women with GDM are prescribed glucose‐lowering medications including metformin and/or insulin. This review aimed to determine the safety and effectiveness of probiotics in treating women with GDM. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence for randomised controlled trials (latest July 2019). We identified nine studies, involving 695 women with GDM. All trials compared probiotics with placebo. The certainty of the evidence was assessed as very low or low. The overall risk of bias was low to unclear. 
Seven trials were conducted in Iran; one in Thailand, and one in Ireland. Trials took place in hospitals and universities. 
We are uncertain if there is any difference between probiotic and placebo in rates of: high blood‐pressure disorders (three studies, 256 participants, low‐certainty evidence); caesarean section (three studies, 267 women, low‐certainty evidence); and large‐for‐gestational‐age babies (two studies, 174 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
We are uncertain if there is any difference between probiotic and placebo for induction of labour (one study, 127 participants, very low‐certainty evidence) and low blood glucose levels in the newborn (three studies, 177 participants, low‐certainty evidence). We are also uncertain if there is any difference between probiotics and placebo for heavy bleeding immediately after birth, weight gain during pregnancy or total gestational weight gain. 
We are uncertain if there is any difference in fasting blood glucose between probiotics and placebo (seven studies, 554 participants). Probiotics may be assoicated with a slight reduction in triglycerides and total cholesterol (four studies, 320 participants). There was reduction in insulin secretion with probiotics (seven studies, 505 participants). One trial (60 participants) showed no difference between groups in need for insulin. 
Biomarkers, did show a reduction in insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR), (seven studies, 505 participants) and insulin resistance and β cell function (HOMA‐B) (two studies,130 participants) with probiotics. Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) increased (four studies, 276 participants) with probiotics. 
Inflammatory markers, hs‐CRP (four studies, 248 participants) and interleukin 6 (two studies, 128 participants) were reduced with probiotics. Antioxidant total glutathione was increased (two studies, 120 participants) and the oxidative stress biomarker malondialdehyde was reduced with probiotics (three studies, 176 participants). We are uncertain if there is any difference in total antioxidant capacity (four studies 266 participants). 
For the newborn baby, we are uncertain if there is any difference between groups for: birthweight, gestational age at birth, preterm births, large babies, head circumference and length scores, or need for admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. The number of babies with high levels of bilirubin was reduced with probiotics. 
No adverse events were reported by the trials.
What does this mean? 
Based on the clinical trials available, the evidence is limited to support the use of probiotics as treatment for women with GDM to improve pregnancy outcomes for mothers and their babies. Larger well‐designed randomised controlled trials are needed to assess the effects of probiotics on management of glucose levels and when available, they can be included in the update of this review.","# Plain Language Summary: Probiotics for Gestational Diabetes During Pregnancy

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether probiotics (helpful bacteria) can help treat gestational diabetes—a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. Researchers wanted to know if probiotics are safe and if they work.

## Who was studied?

The review combined results from 9 studies involving 695 pregnant women who had gestational diabetes. Most studies were done in Iran, with one each in Thailand and Ireland.

## What was tested?

All studies compared probiotics to a placebo (fake treatment). Women either took probiotics or placebo pills during their pregnancy.

## What did researchers find?

**For mothers:**
- We don't have clear answers about whether probiotics prevent high blood pressure during pregnancy or reduce the need for cesarean delivery
- We don't know if probiotics reduce the need for labor induction
- Probiotics may slightly lower cholesterol and fat levels in the blood
- Probiotics showed some improvements in blood sugar control markers (tests that measure how the body handles sugar)
- No serious side effects were reported

**For babies:**
- We don't have clear answers about whether probiotics prevent babies from being too large or having low blood sugar after birth
- One finding suggested probiotics might reduce jaundice (yellowing of baby's skin)
- No serious side effects were reported

## Why aren't the answers clearer?

The studies were small, and researchers used different types of probiotics. The evidence quality is low, meaning we can't be confident in the results yet.

## What's next?

Researchers say larger, better-designed studies are needed to know if probiotics truly help treat gestational diabetes.","### Simple Summary of the Probiotics and Gestational Diabetes Study

**Purpose of the Study**
This study looked at whether taking probiotics is safe and effective for women with gestational diabetes (GDM) and how it affects mothers and their babies. GDM is a type of diabetes that appears during pregnancy.

**What Are Probiotics?**
Probiotics are good bacteria that, when taken in the right amounts, can be healthy for us.

**Study Details**
- Researchers searched various databases for clinical trials about probiotics and GDM.
- They included nine trials with a total of 695 pregnant women from Iran, Thailand, and Ireland.
- These women took either probiotics or a placebo (a fake treatment).

**What Did They Find?**

- **For Mothers:**
  - We're not sure if probiotics change the chance of high blood pressure during pregnancy or the need for a C-section because there's not enough strong evidence.
  - Probiotics might slightly reduce some fats in the blood and improve some diabetes markers, but the evidence is not strong.

- **For Babies:**
  - It's unclear if probiotics affect the risk of having a large baby or low blood sugar in newborns.
  - There was a sign that probiotics might help reduce newborn jaundice (a condition where babies have yellow skin), but the proof is limited.
  
**Safety**
- No harmful effects were reported from taking probiotics in these trials.

**Conclusion**
Because the number of people in these studies was small and different types of probiotics were used, it's hard to say for sure if probiotics help women with GDM or their babies. Bigger and better studies are needed."
"Background
Gastrointestinal paralysis, nausea and vomiting and pain are major clinical problems following abdominal surgery. Anaesthetic and analgesic techniques that reduce pain and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), while preventing or reducing postoperative ileus, may reduce postoperative morbidity, duration of hospitalization and hospital costs. This review was first published in 2001 and was updated by new review authors in 2016. 
Objectives
To compare effects of postoperative epidural analgesia with local anaesthetics versus postoperative systemic or epidural opioids in terms of return of gastrointestinal transit, postoperative pain control, postoperative vomiting, incidence of anastomotic leak, length of hospital stay and costs after abdominal surgery. 
Search methods
We identified trials by conducting computerized searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 12), MEDLINE (from 1950 to December 2014) and EMBASE (from 1974 to December 2014) and by checking the reference lists of trials retained. When we reran the search in February 2016, we added 16 potential new studies of interest to the list of ‘Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate these studies into formal review findings during the next review update. 
Selection criteria
We included parallel randomized controlled trials comparing effects of postoperative epidural local anaesthetic versus regimens based on systemic or epidural opioids. 
Data collection and analysis
We rated the quality of studies by using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. Two review authors independently extracted data and judged the quality of evidence according to the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) scale. 
Main results
We included 128 trials with 8754 participants in the review, and 94 trials with 5846 participants in the analysis. Trials included in the review were funded as follows: charity (n = 19), departmental resources (n = 8), governmental sources (n = 15) and industry (in part or in total) (n = 15). The source of funding was not specified for the other studies. 
Results of 22 trials including 1138 participants show that an epidural containing a local anaesthetic will decrease the time required for return of gastrointestinal transit as measured by time to first flatus after an abdominal surgery (standardized mean difference (SMD) ‐1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.71 to ‐0.86; high quality of evidence; equivalent to 17.5 hours). The effect is proportionate to the concentration of local anaesthetic used. A total of 28 trials including 1559 participants reported a decrease in time to first faeces (stool) (SMD ‐0.67, 95% CI ‐0.86 to ‐0.47; low quality of evidence; equivalent to 22 hours). Thirty‐five trials including 2731 participants found that pain on movement at 24 hours after surgery was also reduced (SMD ‐0.89, 95% CI ‐1.08 to ‐0.70; moderate quality of evidence; equivalent to 2.5 on scale from 0 to 10). From findings of 22 trials including 1154 participants we did not find a difference in the incidence of vomiting within 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.23; low quality of evidence). From investigators in 17 trials including 848 participants we did not find a difference in the incidence of gastrointestinal anastomotic leak (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.32; low quality of evidence). Researchers in 30 trials including 2598 participants noted that epidural analgesia reduced length of hospital stay for an open surgery (SMD ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.35 to ‐0.04; very low quality of evidence; equivalent to one day). Data on costs were very limited. 
Authors' conclusions
An epidural containing a local anaesthetic, with or without the addition of an opioid, accelerates the return of gastrointestinal transit (high quality of evidence). An epidural containing a local anaesthetic with an opioid decreases pain after abdominal surgery (moderate quality of evidence). We did not find a difference in the incidence of vomiting or anastomotic leak (low quality of evidence). For open surgery, an epidural containing a local anaesthetic would reduce the length of hospital stay (very low quality of evidence).","Epidural local anaesthetics for prevention of postoperative gastrointestinal paralysis, vomiting and pain after abdominal surgery 
Background 
Pain and gut paralysis (movement failure) commonly occur after abdominal surgery. Following laparotomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy and colectomy, approximately 10.3% of patients will have temporary gut paralysis. This may prolong length of hospital stay and may increase costs of the procedure. Among the possible ways to treat pain after abdominal surgery are an epidural and injections of opioids (morphine‐like substances or pain killers). An epidural consists of inserting a catheter (a narrow tube) into the epidural space (the virtual space surrounding the membrane that contains cerebrospinal fluid and the spinal cord) and infusing a solution of local anaesthetic (substance that cuts pain transmission to the brain) (alone or in combination with opioids) to anaesthetize the abdomen. This Cochrane review compares the effects of an epidural containing a local anaesthetic with those of an opioid‐based regimen on the postoperative course after abdominal surgery. 
Search dates 
The evidence is current to December 2014. When we reran the search in February 2016, we added 16 potential new studies of interest to the list of ‘Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate them into formal review findings during the next review update. 
Study characteristics 
We included 128 trials with 8754 participants of both sexes aged between 33 and 76 years in the review and 94 trials with 5846 participants in the analysis. Three trials reported that their trial was officially registered. 
Study funding sources  
Trials included in the review were funded as follows: charity (n = 19), departmental resources (n = 8), governmental sources (n = 15) and industry (in part or in total) (n = 15). The source of funding was not specified for the other trials. 
Key results 
We found that an epidural containing a local anaesthetic reduces the time required for return of gut function compared with an opioid‐based regimen (equivalent to 17 hours). An epidural providing a local anaesthetic and an opioid also reduce pain (equivalent to a reduction of 2.5 on a scale from 0 to 10 for pain on movement at 24 hours after surgery) and time spent in hospital for open surgery (equivalent to one day). We found no evidence that an epidural with a local anaesthetic would affect the incidence of vomiting or poor healing of the gut. 
Quality of evidence 
We rated the quality of the evidence as high for return of gastrointestinal function, moderate for pain treatment, low for no effect on vomiting or healing of the gut and very low for reduced time spent in the hospital after open surgery.","# Plain Language Summary

## What is this study about?

After belly surgery, patients often have problems like pain, nausea, vomiting, and their stomach not working properly. This review looked at whether a special pain treatment called epidural analgesia (medicine given through a tube near the spine) helps patients recover better than regular pain medicine.

## Who was studied?

The review included 128 different research studies with 8,754 people total. These studies compared two ways of managing pain after belly surgery.

## What were the treatments?

**Group 1:** Epidural analgesia with local anesthetic (numbing medicine) — sometimes with added strong pain medicine

**Group 2:** Regular pain medicine given by mouth or IV, or epidural with only strong pain medicine

## What did researchers measure?

- How quickly the stomach started working again
- Pain levels
- Nausea and vomiting
- Serious complications
- How long patients stayed in the hospital

## Main findings

✓ **Stomach function:** Epidural with numbing medicine helped the stomach work again about 17–22 hours faster

✓ **Pain:** Patients had less pain when moving around the day after surgery

✓ **Hospital stay:** Patients went home about one day sooner

✗ **Nausea/vomiting:** No real difference between treatments

✗ **Serious complications:** No difference in serious problems

## Bottom line

Epidural analgesia with numbing medicine appears to help patients recover faster after belly surgery, with less pain and shorter hospital stays.","### Plain Language Summary

**Why This Study Was Done:**
After abdominal surgery, people often have trouble with their stomach and intestines not moving properly. They also experience pain, nausea, and vomiting. This study looked at different ways to help with these problems to see if it could help patients get better faster and reduce hospital costs.

**What the Study Looked At:**
The study compared two treatments used after surgery:
1. **Epidural Analgesia** with local anesthetics (which numbs the pain in a specific area).
2. **Opioids** given through the system or as part of the epidural (a type of strong pain medication).

The goal was to see which treatment helped the intestines work again sooner, reduced pain, and affected vomiting, leaks from surgical joins, hospital stay length, and costs.

**How the Study Was Done:**
Researchers looked at 128 trials involving 8,754 participants to gather and compare data. The studies were funded by different organizations, including charities and government groups. 

**What They Found:**

- **Faster Intestinal Movement:** People who received an epidural with local anesthetics had their intestines start moving sooner after surgery. It reduced the time to pass gas by 17.5 hours and stool by 22 hours.

- **Pain Reduction:** Epidurals with local anesthetics also helped reduce pain 24 hours after surgery.

- **Vomiting and Leaks:** There was no significant difference in vomiting or surgical site leaks between the groups.

- **Hospital Stay:** Using an epidural with local anesthetics may shorten hospital stays by about one day for open surgeries.

**Conclusion:**
Using epidural anesthesia with local anesthetics can help the intestines work faster and reduce pain after surgery. There isn't much difference in vomiting or leaks, and it may help shorten hospital stays. This could be a helpful way to improve recovery after abdominal surgery."
"Background
Depression is common in people with non‐communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and chronic respiratory conditions. The co‐existence of depression and NCDs may affect health behaviours, compliance with treatment, physiological factors, and quality of life. This in turn is associated with worse outcomes for both conditions. Behavioural activation is not currently indicated for the treatment of depression in this population in the UK, but is increasingly being used to treat depression in adults. 
Objectives
To examine the effects of behavioural activation compared with any control group for the treatment of depression in adults with NCDs. 
To examine the effects of behavioural activation compared with each control group separately (no treatment, waiting list, other psychological therapy, pharmacological treatment, or any other type of treatment as usual) for the treatment of depression in adults with NCDs. 
Search methods
We searched CCMD‐CTR, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, and two trial registers on 4 October 2019 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of behavioural activation for depression in participants with NCDs, together with grey literature and reference checking. We applied no restrictions on date, language, or publication status to the searches. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs of behavioural activation for the treatment of depression in adults with one of four NCDs: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and chronic respiratory conditions. Only participants with a formal diagnosis of both depression and an NCD were eligible. Studies were included if behavioural activation was the main component of the intervention. We included studies with any comparator that was not behavioural activation, and regardless of reported outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane, including independent screening of titles/abstracts and full‐text manuscripts, data extraction, and risk of bias assessments in duplicate. Where necessary, we contacted study authors for more information. 
Main results
We included two studies, contributing data from 181 participants to the analyses.
Both studies recruited participants from US hospital clinics; one included people who were recovering from a stroke and the other women with breast cancer. For both studies, the intervention consisted of eight weeks of face‐to‐face behavioural therapy, with one study comparing to poststroke treatment as usual and the other comparing to problem‐solving therapy. 
Both studies were at risk of performance bias and potential conflict of interest arising from author involvement in the development of the intervention. For one study, risks of selection bias and reporting bias were unclear and the study was judged at high risk of attrition bias. 
Treatment efficacy (remission) was greater for behavioural activation than for comparators in the short term (risk ratio (RR) 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 2.38; low‐certainty evidence) and medium term (RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.08; moderate‐certainty evidence), but these estimates lacked precision and effects were reduced in the long term (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.23; moderate‐certainty evidence). We found no evidence of a difference in treatment acceptability in the short term (RR 1.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 4.82) and medium term (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.25 to 3.10) (low‐certainty evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference in depression symptoms between behavioural activation and comparators (short term: MD –1.15, 95% CI –2.71 to 0.41; low‐certainty evidence). One study found no difference for quality of life (short term: MD 0.40, 95% CI –0.16 to 0.96; low‐certainty evidence), functioning (short term: MD 2.70, 95% CI –6.99 to 12.39; low‐certainty evidence), and anxiety symptoms (short term: MD –1.70, 95% CI –4.50 to 1.10; low‐certainty evidence). 
Neither study reported data on adverse effects.
Authors' conclusions
Evidence from this review was not sufficient to draw conclusions on the efficacy and acceptability of behavioural activation for the treatment of depression in adults with NCDs. A future review may wish to include, or focus on, studies of people with subthreshold depression or depression symptoms without a formal diagnosis, as this may inform whether behavioural activation could be used to treat mild or undiagnosed (or both) depressive symptoms in people with NCDs. Evidence from low‐resource settings including low‐ and middle‐income countries, for which behavioural activation may offer a feasible alternative to other treatments for depression, would be of interest.","Behavioural activation therapy for depression in adults with long‐term physical conditions
Depression is common in adults with long‐term physical conditions. Long‐term physical illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, or chronic respiratory conditions, can impact on mental health. Mental health problems can also affect how people cope with a physical condition. Behavioural activation is a type of talking therapy used to treat depression in adults and it could be an alternative to other psychological therapies or medication. This review assesses the effects of behavioural activation on depression for people with long‐term physical conditions. 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of behavioural activation with adults who were diagnosed with depression and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, or a chronic respiratory condition. An RCT is a study with a control group, in which participants are allocated to the treatment and control groups at random. We searched a variety of online databases, including regional databases and trial registries. The search, conducted on 4 October 2019, identified 6066 records. After screening records, we included two studies in this review and 181 participants contributed data to the analyses. 
Both studies recruited participants from US hospitals. One study included participants recovering from a stroke and the other included women with breast cancer. In both studies, participants received behavioural activation delivered in eight weekly, face‐to‐face sessions. One study compared behavioural activation with poststroke treatment as usual, while the other compared behavioural activation with problem‐solving therapy, a talking therapy. 
Low to moderate‐certainty evidence suggested that behavioural activation may be more effective in the treatment of depression than included comparators, but these estimates were imprecise and effects were reduced in the longer term. There was no evidence of any differences between groups in the number of people who dropped out of the studies, depression symptoms, quality of life, physical functioning, or anxiety symptoms. The studies did not report on side effects during the study period. 
There were several limitations to the included studies. In both studies, participants were aware of the treatment they received. Also, researchers were involved in the design of the intervention in both studies, and may, therefore, have had an interest in a favourable outcome for behavioural activation. In one study, missing data caused by participants dropping out of the study may have influenced results. 
We did not find enough evidence in this review to know whether behavioural activation should be used to treat depression in adults with long‐term physical conditions.","# Plain Language Summary: Behavioral Activation for Depression in People with Long-Term Illnesses

## What is this study about?

This review looked at whether a treatment called ""behavioral activation"" helps people who have both depression and a long-term illness like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or lung disease.

## Why does this matter?

When people have depression along with a long-term illness, both conditions can get worse. Depression can make it harder for people to take care of themselves and follow their treatment plans. Behavioral activation is a newer treatment that doctors are starting to use for depression, but we don't know much about how well it works for people who also have long-term illnesses.

## What is behavioral activation?

Behavioral activation is a type of therapy where a therapist helps you do activities that make you feel better. It's based on the idea that doing things—even when you don't feel like it—can improve your mood.

## What did the researchers find?

The researchers looked for studies that tested behavioral activation against other treatments. They found only **2 studies with 181 people total**:
- One study included people recovering from a stroke
- One study included women with breast cancer

Both studies used 8 weeks of face-to-face therapy sessions.

### Results:

- **Getting better**: Behavioral activation seemed to help more people feel better compared to other treatments, especially at 3–6 months after treatment ended. However, these results weren't very strong or certain.
- **Depression symptoms**: There was no clear difference in how much depression symptoms improved.
- **Other effects**: The studies didn't find clear differences in quality of life, how well people functioned, or anxiety symptoms.
- **Side effects**: The studies didn't report any information about harmful side effects.

## What does this mean?

There isn't enough evidence yet to say whether behavioral activation really works for depression in people with long-term illnesses. We need more and better studies to know for sure.

## Timeline

This review searched for studies through October 2019.","### Plain Language Summary

**What Was This Study About?**

This study looked at how a type of therapy called ""behavioral activation"" can help adults who have both depression and other long-term health problems like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or lung issues.

**What Did They Want to Find Out?**

The researchers wanted to see if behavioral activation worked better than other treatments for depression in adults with these health problems. They compared it to options like no treatment, waiting for treatment, other therapy types, medication, or regular care.

**How Did They Search for Studies?**

They searched several scientific databases and registers to find randomised trials on this topic. They included studies from any time or language, as long as the adults had both depression and one of the mentioned health problems.

**What Did They Find?**

Two studies were included with 181 participants from U.S. hospitals. One study focused on people recovering from a stroke, and the other on women with breast cancer. Both groups received eight weeks of face-to-face behavioral therapy.

**Results:**

- **Short-Term and Medium-Term Benefits:** Behavioral activation seemed to help more with depression than other treatments in the short and medium term, but the effect wasn't very strong.
- **Long-Term Benefits:** The positive effects didn't seem to last as well into the long term.
- **Symptoms and Quality of Life:** There was no clear difference in depression symptoms, quality of life, or anxiety compared to other treatments.
- **Safety:** There was no information on any side effects.

**Conclusions:**

The results are not strong enough to clearly say that behavioral activation is the best treatment for depression in people with these health problems. More studies are needed, especially in areas with fewer resources, to see if this therapy can help these patients, even if they haven't been formally diagnosed with depression."
"Background
Asthma is the most common respiratory disorder complicating pregnancy, and is associated with a range of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. There is strong evidence however, that the adequate control of asthma can improve health outcomes for mothers and their babies. Despite known risks of poorly controlled asthma during pregnancy, a large proportion of women have sub‐optimal asthma control, due to concerns surrounding risks of pharmacological agents, and uncertainties regarding the effectiveness and safety of different management strategies. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of interventions (pharmacologic and non‐pharmacologic) for managing women's asthma in pregnancy on maternal and fetal/infant outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (2 June 2014) and the Cochrane Airways Group's Trials Register (4 June 2014). 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing any intervention used to manage asthma in pregnancy, with placebo, no intervention, or an alternative intervention. We included pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions (including combined interventions). Cluster‐randomised trials were eligible for inclusion (but none were identified). Cross‐over trials were not eligible for inclusion. 
We included multi‐armed trials along with two‐armed trials. We also included studies published as abstracts only. 
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. 
Main results
We included eight trials in this review, involving 1181 women and their babies. Overall we judged two trials to be at low risk of bias, two to be of unclear risk of bias, and four to be at moderate risk of bias. 
Five trials assessed pharmacological agents, including inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone or budesonide), inhaled magnesium sulphate, intravenous theophylline, and inhaled beclomethasone verus oral theophylline. Three trials assessed non‐pharmacological interventions, including a fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO)‐based algorithm versus a clinical guideline‐based algorithm to adjust inhaled corticosteroid therapy, a pharmacist‐led multi‐disciplinary approach to management versus standard care, and progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) versus sham training. 
The eight included trials were assessed under seven separate comparisons.
Pharmacological interventions 
Primary outcomes: one trial suggested that inhaled magnesium sulphate in addition to usual treatment could reduce exacerbation frequency in acute asthma (mean difference (MD) ‐2.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.21 to ‐2.39; 60 women). One trial assessing the addition of intravenous theophylline to standard care in acute asthma did not report on exacerbations (65 women). No clear difference was shown in the risk of exacerbations with the use of inhaled beclomethasone in addition to usual treatment for maintenance therapy in one trial (risk ratio (RR) 0.36; 95% CI 0.13 to 1.05; 60 women); a second trial also showed no difference, however data were not clearly reported to allow inclusion in a meta‐analysis. No difference was shown when inhaled beclomethasone was compared with oral theophylline for maintenance therapy (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.33; one trial, 385 women). None of these trials reported on neonatal intensive care admissions. 
Secondary outcomes: inhaled magnesium sulphate in acute asthma was shown to improve lung function measures (one trial, 60 women); intravenous theophylline in acute asthma was not associated with benefits (one trial, 65 women). No clear differences were seen with the addition of inhaled corticosteroids to routine treatment in three trials (374 women). While inhaled beclomethasone, compared with oral theophylline, significantly reduced treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects in one trial (384 women), no other differences were observed, except for higher treatment adherence with theophylline. Four of the five trials did not report on adverse effects. 
Non‐pharmacological interventions 
Primary outcomes: in one trial, the use of a FENO‐based algorithm was shown to significantly reduce asthma exacerbations (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.90; 220 women); and a trend towards fewer neonatal hospitalisations was observed (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.21 to 1.02; 214 infants). No exacerbations occurred in one trial assessing pharmacist‐led management; this approach did not reduce neonatal intensive care admissions (RR 1.50; 95% CI 0.27 to 8.32; 58 infants). One trial (64 women) assessing PMR did not report on exacerbations or neonatal intensive care admissions. 
Secondary outcomes: the use of a FENO‐based algorithm to adjust therapy led to some improvements in quality of life scores, as well as more frequent use of inhaled corticosteroids and long‐acting β‐agonists, and less frequent use of short‐acting β‐agonists (one trial, 220 women). The FENO‐based algorithm was associated with fewer infants with recurrent episodes of bronchiolitis in their first year of life, and a trend towards fewer episodes of croup for infants. Pharmacist‐led management improved asthma control scores at six months (one trial, 60 women); PMR improved lung function and quality of life measures (one trial, 64 women). No other differences between comparisons were observed. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on eight included trials, of moderate quality overall, no firm conclusions about optimal interventions for managing asthma in pregnancy can be made. Five trials assessing pharmacological interventions did not provide clear evidence of benefits or harms to support or refute current practice. While inhaled magnesium sulphate for acute asthma was shown to reduce exacerbations, this was in one small trial of unclear quality, and thus this finding should be interpreted with caution. Three trials assessing non‐pharmacological interventions provided some support for the use of such strategies, however were not powered to detect differences in important maternal and infant outcomes. While a FENO‐based algorithm reduced exacerbations, the effects on perinatal outcomes were less certain, and thus widespread implementation is not yet appropriate. Similarly, though positive effects on asthma control were shown with PMR and pharmacist‐led management, the evidence to date is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. 
In view of the limited evidence base, further randomised trials are required to determine the most effective and safe interventions for asthma in pregnancy. Future trials must be sufficiently powered, and well‐designed, to allow differences in important outcomes for mothers and babies to be detected. The impact on health services requires evaluation. Any further trials assessing pharmacological interventions should assess novel agents or those used in current practice. Encouragingly, at least five trials have been identified as planned or underway.","Interventions for managing asthma in pregnancy
Asthma is the most common disorder of the respiratory system (the organs that help you breathe) in pregnancy, affecting up to one in eight women. During pregnancy asthma can improve, worsen or remain unchanged. Poorly controlled asthma may lead to complications for mothers including pre‐eclampsia (high blood pressure and protein in the urine), gestational diabetes (high blood glucose) and caesarean birth; complications for babies may include death, preterm birth (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) and being born low birthweight. Maintaining adequate control of asthma during pregnancy, including effective management and prevention of exacerbations, is the goal of management. In pregnancy, women may be concerned about risks of taking medications, and their health professionals may be uncertain about best management strategies. 
This review aimed to assess how effective and safe different interventions are for managing asthma during pregnancy. We were able to include eight randomised controlled trials involving 1181 women and their babies. The trials were of moderate quality overall. Five trials assessed medications. Inhaled magnesium sulphate helped to reduce further exacerbations for women with acute asthma, and helped to improve their lung function (one trial of unclear quality, 60 women). For ongoing therapy for pregnant women with stable asthma, the effect of inhaled corticosteroids on asthma exacerbations was not clear (two trials, 155 women; but data only analysed from one trial, 60 women); no difference was seen in the chance of exacerbations when inhaled corticosteroids were compared with oral theophylline, however more women receiving theophylline stopped treatment because of side effects (one trial, 385 women). Three trials assessed non‐drug interventions. Adjusting women's asthma medications according to how much nitric oxide they exhaled (their fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO)) was shown to reduce exacerbations and improve their quality of life (one trial, 220 women). Progressive muscle relaxation improved women's lung function and quality of life (one trial, 64 women), and asthma management led by a pharmacist helped to improve asthma control (one trial, 60 women). 
Overall, we did not find enough evidence of benefits and harms from the randomised trials to be sure about the best way to manage asthma in pregnancy, although some interventions were promising. We need larger, high‐quality trials, which should report on important health outcomes for mothers and babies, including longer‐term outcomes for babies into childhood and adulthood. Five trials are currently being planned or are underway assessing interventions for asthma in pregnancy.","# Plain Language Summary: Managing Asthma During Pregnancy

## What is this study about?

This review looked at different treatments and strategies to help pregnant women control their asthma. Researchers wanted to find out which methods work best and are safest for both mothers and babies.

## Why is this important?

Asthma is common in pregnant women and can cause problems for mothers and babies if it's not well controlled. When asthma is managed properly, both mothers and babies have better health outcomes. However, many pregnant women don't get good asthma control because they worry about medicine safety during pregnancy.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers reviewed 8 studies that tested different asthma treatments during pregnancy. These studies included 1,181 pregnant women and their babies. The treatments tested included:
- **Medicines** (like inhaled steroids and magnesium)
- **Non-medicine approaches** (like relaxation exercises and special monitoring methods)

## What did they find?

**Medicine treatments:** The results were mixed. One small study showed that adding magnesium to regular asthma medicine helped reduce asthma attacks. However, most medicine studies didn't show clear benefits or problems.

**Non-medicine treatments:** These showed more promise. One method that used special breathing measurements to adjust medicine doses reduced asthma attacks. Relaxation exercises and pharmacist-led care also helped some women.

## What does this mean?

Researchers don't yet have enough strong evidence to say which treatment is best for pregnant women with asthma. More and better studies are needed to find the safest and most effective options.","### Plain Language Summary

**Study Purpose**

This study looked at different ways to help pregnant women with asthma. The goal was to find out which treatments are safe and effective for both mothers and their babies.

**Who Was Involved**

Researchers included eight studies with a total of 1,181 pregnant women and their babies.

**What Was Tested**

The study tested different treatments, which were divided into two categories:

1. **Medicines**: These included inhalers and other drugs.
2. **Non-Medicine Approaches**: These included using special guidelines to adjust medicine, having a pharmacist help with care, and muscle relaxation exercises.

**Key Findings**

- **Medicines**: One small study found that adding inhaled magnesium sulfate might help reduce asthma attacks. Other medicine trials didn’t show clear benefits or harms.
  
- **Non-Medicine Approaches**:
  - Using special guidelines helped reduce asthma attacks and improved quality of life.
  - Pharmacist-led care helped control asthma better after six months.
  - Muscle relaxation exercises improved lung function and quality of life.

**Limits of the Study**

The study couldn’t make strong recommendations because the evidence wasn’t strong enough. More research is needed to find the best and safest treatments for asthma in pregnancy.

**What’s Next**

Future studies should be better designed to clearly show how these treatments affect mothers and babies. Some new studies are already being planned or are underway."
"Background
Long‐term physical conditions affect 10% to 12% of children and adolescents worldwide; these individuals are at greater risk of developing psychological problems, particularly anxiety and depression. Access to face‐to‐face treatment for such problems is often limited, and available interventions usually have not been tested with this population. As technology improves, e‐health interventions (delivered via digital means, such as computers and smart phones and ranging from simple text‐based programmes through to multimedia and interactive programmes, serious games, virtual reality and biofeedback programmes) offer a potential solution to address the psychological needs of this group of young people. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of e‐health interventions in comparison with attention placebos, psychological placebos, treatment as usual, waiting‐list controls, or non‐psychological treatments for treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Controlled Trials Register (CCMDTR to May 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 8, 2017), Web of Science (1900 ‐ 18 August 2016, updated 31 August 2017) and Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO (cross‐search 2016 to 18 Aug 2017). We hand‐searched relevant conference proceedings, reference lists of included articles, and the grey literature to May 2016. We also searched international trial registries to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐randomised trials, and cross‐over trials of e‐health interventions for treating any type of long‐term physical condition in children and adolescents (aged 0 to 18 years), and that measured changes in symptoms or diagnoses of anxiety, depression, or subthreshold depression. We defined long‐term physical conditions as those that were more than three‐months' duration. We assessed symptoms of anxiety and depression using patient‐ or clinician‐administered validated rating scales based on DSM III, IV or 5 (American Psychological Association 2013), or ICD 9 or 10 criteria (World Health Organization 1992). Formal depressive and anxiety disorders were diagnosed using structured clinical interviews. Attention placebo, treatment as usual, waiting list, psychological placebo, and other non‐psychological therapies were eligible comparators. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and full‐text articles; discrepancies were resolved through discussion or addressed by a third author. When available, we used odds ratio (OR) to compare dichotomous data and standardised mean differences (SMD) to analyse continuous data, both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We undertook meta‐analysis when treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical question were adequately similar. Otherwise, we undertook a narrative analysis. 
Main results
We included five trials of three interventions (Breathe Easier Online, Web‐MAP, and multimodal cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)), which included 463 participants aged 10 to 18 years. Each trial contributed to at least one meta‐analysis. Trials involved children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions, such as chronic headache (migraine, tension headache, and others), chronic pain conditions (abdominal, musculoskeletal, and others), chronic respiratory illness (asthma, cystic fibrosis, and others), and symptoms of anxiety or depression. Participants were recruited from community settings and hospital clinics in high income countries. 
For the primary outcome of change in depression symptoms versus any control, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD ‐0.06, 95% CI ‐0.35 to 0.23; five RCTs, 441 participants). For the primary outcome of change in anxiety symptoms versus any comparator, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐0.29 to 0.14; two RCTs, 324 participants). For the primary outcome of treatment acceptability, there was very low‐quality evidence that e‐health interventions were less acceptable than any comparator (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.69; two RCTs, 304 participants). 
For the secondary outcome of quality of life, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD ‐0.83, 95% CI ‐1.53 to ‐0.12; one RCT, 34 participants). For the secondary outcome of functioning, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.18; three RCTs, 368 participants). For the secondary outcome of status of long‐term physical condition, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD 0.06, 95% CI ‐0.12 to 0.24; five RCTs, 463 participants). 
The risk of selection bias was considered low in most trials. However, the risk of bias due to inadequate blinding of participants or outcome assessors was considered unclear or high in all trials. Only one study had a published protocol; two trials had incomplete outcome data. All trials were conducted by the intervention developers, introducing another possible bias. No adverse effects were reported by any authors. 
Authors' conclusions
At present, the field of e‐health interventions for the treatment of anxiety or depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions is limited to five low quality trials. The very low‐quality of the evidence means the effects of e‐health interventions are uncertain at this time, especially in children aged under 10 years. 
Although it is too early to recommend e‐health interventions for this clinical population, given their growing number, and the global improvement in access to technology, there appears to be room for the development and evaluation of acceptable and effective technologically‐based treatments to suit children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions.","E‐health interventions for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions 
Why is this review important? 
More than one in ten children and adolescents worldwide have long‐term physical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, and cancer. They are more likely to develop psychological problems, which include anxiety or depression. Treating such problems early can prevent difficulties with friendships, family life, school, and future mental health problems. Accessing traditionally delivered face‐to‐face therapy can be difficult, due to the limited number of services. As technology improves, and therapies become available on computers and mobile telephones, e‐health interventions (delivered by digital means and ranging from simple text‐based programmes through to multimedia and interactive programmes, serious games, virtual reality and biofeedback programmes) may be useful to treat anxiety and depression in these children and adolescents. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
This review will be of interest to parents, children and adolescents, mental healthcare providers, service commissioners, and professionals caring for children with long‐term physical conditions. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
This review aimed to answer the following questions: 1) Are e‐health interventions better than a selected range of other therapies or waiting list in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions? and 2) Are e‐health interventions acceptable to these children and adolescents? 
Which studies were included in the review? 
We searched reference databases to find all randomised controlled trials, cluster‐randomised trials, and cross‐over trials of e‐health interventions for treating anxiety or depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions that were published between 1970 and August 2017. Trials had to be randomised controlled trials that included children and young people with either symptoms or formal diagnoses of anxiety or depression. We included five trials, with a total of 463 young people, in the review. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
We included five trials of three e‐health interventions (Breathe Easier Online, Web‐MAP, and multimodal cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)), undertaken with children aged 10 to 18 years old. Although some of these interventions were acceptable to users, none of them were clearly any better than a selected range of other therapies or waiting list at reducing symptoms of anxiety or depression.The very low quality of the evidence means the effects of e‐health interventions are uncertain at this time, especially in children aged under 10 years. The review authors rated the overall risk of bias in the trials as high or uncertain. 
What should happen next? 
Further research should be undertaken to develop more effective e‐health interventions to treat anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions.","# Plain Language Summary: Digital Programs for Anxiety and Depression in Young People with Long-Term Health Conditions

## What is this study about?

This study looked at whether computer and smartphone programs can help children and teenagers with long-term health problems (like asthma, chronic pain, or migraines) who are also struggling with anxiety or depression.

## Why is this important?

About 1 in 10 children worldwide have long-term health conditions. Many of these young people also develop anxiety or depression. Getting face-to-face counseling or therapy can be hard to find. Digital programs (apps, websites, games, and other technology-based tools) might be an easier way to help them.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked for studies that tested digital programs designed to reduce anxiety and depression in young people (ages 0–18) with long-term health conditions. They found and reviewed 5 studies involving 463 young people ages 10–18 with conditions like asthma, chronic headaches, and chronic pain.

## What did they find?

The researchers could **not clearly tell** if the digital programs worked better than other treatments for:
- Reducing depression symptoms
- Reducing anxiety symptoms
- Improving quality of life
- Improving how well young people function day-to-day
- Improving their long-term health condition

One finding: Young people seemed **less likely to stick with** the digital programs compared to other treatments.

## What about safety?

No harmful side effects were reported.

## What does this mean?

There is not enough good-quality evidence yet to say whether these digital programs really help. More research is needed. However, as more young people get access to technology, developing better digital programs for this group could be helpful in the future.","### Plain Language Summary

**Who was in the study?**
This study focused on children and teens aged 10 to 18 who have long-lasting physical conditions like asthma or chronic headaches. These conditions last more than three months and can sometimes make kids feel anxious or sad.

**What was the study about?**
Researchers wanted to know if digital programs (like ones on computers or phones) could help these kids feel less anxious or sad. They compared these programs to other types of help, like waiting for treatment or usual care.

**What did they do?**
They looked at five different studies with a total of 463 kids. The studies tested digital programs such as Breathe Easier Online, Web-MAP, and a type of therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).

**What did they find?**
The researchers found that the results were not clear. They couldn't tell if the digital programs were better or worse than other treatments. Kids didn’t seem to prefer these programs, and there wasn't a big improvement in their quality of life or daily activities.

**What about safety?**
No harmful effects were reported from using these digital programs.

**Any problems with the study?**
Yes, there were some issues. The information was not very strong or clear, and there could be some mistakes because people involved in making the programs also did the studies.

**What does this mean?**
It's too early to say if digital programs are helpful for these kids. More studies are needed to find out if they will work in the future. With technology getting better, there is hope for new treatments that work well and are easy for kids to use."
