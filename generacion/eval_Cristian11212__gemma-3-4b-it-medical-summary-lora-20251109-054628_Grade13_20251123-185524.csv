Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia are becoming increasingly common with the aging of most populations. The majority of individuals with dementia will first present for care and assessment in primary care settings. There is a need for brief dementia screening instruments that can accurately detect dementia in primary care settings. The Mini‐Cog is a brief, cognitive screening test that is frequently used to evaluate cognition in older adults in various settings. 
Objectives
To determine the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog for detecting dementia in a primary care setting. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Register of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies, MEDLINE, Embase and four other databases, initially to September 2012. Since then, four updates to the search were performed using the same search methods, and the most recent was January 2017. We used citation tracking (using the databases' ‘related articles’ feature, where available) as an additional search method and contacted authors of eligible studies for unpublished data. 
Selection criteria
We only included studies that evaluated the Mini‐Cog as an index test for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia or related forms of dementia when compared to a reference standard using validated criteria for dementia. We only included studies that were conducted in primary care populations. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted and described information on the characteristics of the study participants and study setting. Using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2) criteria we evaluated the quality of studies, and we assessed risk of bias and applicability of each study for each domain in QUADAS‐2. Two review authors independently extracted information on the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives and entered the data into Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5). We then used RevMan 5 to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and 95% confidence intervals. We summarized the sensitivity and specificity of the Mini‐Cog in the individual studies in forest plots and also plotted them in a receiver operating characteristic plot. We also created a 'Risk of bias' and applicability concerns graph to summarize information related to the quality of included studies. 
Main results
There were a total of four studies that met our inclusion criteria, including a total of 1517 total participants. The sensitivity of the Mini‐Cog varied between 0.76 to 1.00 in studies while the specificity varied between 0.27 to 0.85. The included studies displayed significant heterogeneity in both methodologies and clinical populations, which did not allow for a meta‐analysis to be completed. Only one study (Holsinger 2012) was found to be at low risk of bias on all methodological domains. The results of this study reported that the sensitivity of the Mini‐Cog was 0.76 and the specificity was 0.73. We found the quality of all other included studies to be low due to a high risk of bias with methodological limitations primarily in their selection of participants. 
Authors' conclusions
There is a limited number of studies evaluating the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog for the diagnosis of dementia in primary care settings. Given the small number of studies, the wide range in estimates of the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog, and methodological limitations identified in most of the studies, at the present time there is insufficient evidence to recommend that the Mini‐Cog be used as a screening test for dementia in primary care. Further studies are required to determine the accuracy of Mini‐Cog in primary care and whether this tool has sufficient diagnostic test accuracy to be useful as a screening test in this setting.","Accuracy of the Mini‐Cog for detecting dementia in primary care settings

Tuberculous pericarditis can impair the heart's function and cause death; long term, it can cause the membrane to fibrose and constrict causing heart failure. In addition to antituberculous chemotherapy, treatments include corticosteroids, drainage, and surgery. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of treatments for tuberculous pericarditis.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (27 March 2017); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library (2017, Issue 2); MEDLINE (1966 to 27 March 2017); Embase (1974 to 27 March 2017); and LILACS (1982 to 27 March 2017). In addition we searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal using 'tuberculosis' and 'pericard*' as search terms on 27 March 2017. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and contacted researchers in the field of tuberculous pericarditis. This is a new version of the original 2002 review. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened search outputs, evaluated study eligibility, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data; and we resolved any discrepancies by discussion and consensus. One trial assessed the effects of both corticosteroid and Mycobacterium indicus pranii treatment in a two‐by‐two factorial design; we excluded data from the group that received both interventions. We conducted fixed‐effect meta‐analysis and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Seven trials met the inclusion criteria; all were from sub‐Saharan Africa and included 1959 participants, with 1051/1959 (54%) HIV‐positive. All trials evaluated corticosteroids and one each evaluated colchicine, M. indicus pranii immunotherapy, and open surgical drainage. Four trials (1841 participants) were at low risk of bias, and three trials (118 participants) were at high risk of bias. 
In people who are not infected with HIV, corticosteroids may reduce deaths from all causes (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.09; 660 participants, 4 trials, low certainty evidence) and the need for repeat pericardiocentesis (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.04; 492 participants, 2 trials, low certainty evidence). Corticosteroids probably reduce deaths from pericarditis (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.80; 660 participants, 4 trials, moderate certainty evidence). However, we do not know whether or not corticosteroids have an effect on constriction or cancer among HIV‐negative people (very low certainty evidence). 
In people living with HIV, only 19.9% (203/1959) were on antiretroviral drugs. Corticosteroids may reduce constriction (RR 0.55, 0.26 to 1.16; 575 participants, 3 trials, low certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether corticosteroids have an effect on all‐cause death or cancer (very low certainty evidence); and may have little or no effect on repeat pericardiocentesis (RR 1.02, 0.89 to 1.18; 517 participants, 2 trials, low certainty evidence). 
For colchicine among people living with HIV, we found one small trial (33 participants) which had insufficient data to make any conclusions about any effects on death or constrictive pericarditis. 
Irrespective of HIV status, due to very low certainty evidence from one trial, it is uncertain whether adding M. indicus pranii immunotherapy to antituberculous drugs has an effect on any outcome. 
Open surgical drainage for effusion may reduce repeat pericardiocentesis In HIV‐negative people (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.76; 122 participants, 1 trial, low certainty evidence) but may make little or no difference to other outcomes. We did not find an eligible trial that assessed the effects of open surgical drainage in people living with HIV. 
The review authors found no eligible trials that examined the length of antituberculous treatment needed nor the effects of other adjunctive treatments for tuberculous pericarditis. 
Authors' conclusions
For HIV‐negative patients, corticosteroids may reduce death. For HIV‐positive patients not on antiretroviral drugs, corticosteroids may reduce constriction. For HIV‐positive patients with good antiretroviral drug viral suppression, clinicians may consider the results from HIV‐negative patients more relevant. 
Further research may help evaluate percutaneous drainage of the pericardium under local anaesthesia, the timing of pericardiectomy in tuberculous constrictive pericarditis, and new antibiotic regimens.","Treatment for tuberculous pericarditis
Background 
Tuberculous pericarditis is an inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart. It is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The bacteria can spread through the bloodstream to the heart and cause inflammation of the membrane. The inflammation can cause the membrane to thicken and harden, which can impair the heart's function and cause death. Long term, the membrane can become fibrose and constrict causing heart failure. In addition to antituberculous chemotherapy, treatments include corticosteroids, drainage, and surgery.

To assess the effects of treatments for tuberculous pericarditis.

Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions are frequently implemented to reduce infectious diseases, and may be linked to improved nutrition outcomes in children. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effect of interventions to improve water quality and supply (adequate quantity to maintain hygiene practices), provide adequate sanitation and promote handwashing with soap, on the nutritional status of children under the age of 18 years and to identify current research gaps. 
Search methods
We searched 10 English‐language (including MEDLINE and CENTRAL) and three Chinese‐language databases for published studies in June 2012. We searched grey literature databases, conference proceedings and websites, reviewed reference lists and contacted experts and authors. 
Selection criteria
Randomised (including cluster‐randomised), quasi‐randomised and non‐randomised controlled trials, controlled cohort or cross‐sectional studies and historically controlled studies, comparing WASH interventions among children aged under 18 years. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently sought and extracted data on childhood anthropometry, biochemical measures of micronutrient status, and adherence, attrition and costs either from published reports or through contact with study investigators. We calculated mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We conducted study‐level and individual‐level meta‐analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect for randomised controlled trials only. 
Main results
Fourteen studies (five cluster‐randomised controlled trials and nine non‐randomised studies with comparison groups) from 10 low‐ and middle‐income countries including 22,241 children at baseline and nutrition outcome data for 9,469 children provided relevant information. Study duration ranged from 6 to 60 months and all studies included children under five years of age at the time of the intervention. Studies included WASH interventions either singly or in combination. Measures of child anthropometry were collected in all 14 studies, and nine studies reported at least one of the following anthropometric indices: weight‐for‐height, weight‐for‐age or height‐for‐age. None of the included studies were of high methodological quality as none of the studies masked the nature of the intervention from participants. 
Weight‐for‐age, weight‐for‐height and height‐for‐age z‐scores were available for five cluster‐randomised controlled trials with a duration of between 9 and 12 months. Meta‐analysis including 4,627 children identified no evidence of an effect of WASH interventions on weight‐for‐age z‐score (MD 0.05; 95% CI ‐0.01 to 0.12). Meta‐analysis including 4,622 children identified no evidence of an effect of WASH interventions on weight‐for‐height z‐score (MD 0.02; 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.11). Meta‐analysis including 4,627 children identified a borderline statistically significant effect of WASH interventions on height‐for‐age z‐score (MD 0.08; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.16). These findings were supported by individual participant data analysis including information on 5,375 to 5,386 children from five cluster‐randomised controlled trials. 
No study reported adverse events. Adherence to study interventions was reported in only two studies (both cluster‐randomised controlled trials) and ranged from low (< 35%) to high (> 90%). Study attrition was reported in seven studies and ranged from 4% to 16.5%. Intervention cost was reported in one study in which the total cost of the WASH interventions was USD 15/inhabitant. None of the studies reported differential impacts relevant to equity issues such as gender, socioeconomic status and religion. 
Authors' conclusions
The available evidence from meta‐analysis of data from cluster‐randomised controlled trials with an intervention period of 9‐12 months is suggestive of a small benefit of WASH interventions (specifically solar disinfection of water, provision of soap, and improvement of water quality) on length growth in children under five years of age. The duration of the intervention studies was relatively short and none of the included studies is of high methodological quality. Very few studies provided information on intervention adherence, attrition and costs. There are several ongoing trials in low‐income country settings that may provide robust evidence to inform these findings.","Water, sanitation and hygiene interventions for improving the nutritional status of children under 18 years of age

Fertility problems are very common, as subfertility affects about 10% to 15% of couples trying to conceive. There are many factors that may impact a couple's ability to conceive and one of these may be incorrect timing of intercourse. Conception is only possible from approximately five days before up to several hours after ovulation. Therefore, to be effective, intercourse must take place during this fertile period. 'Timed intercourse' is the practice of prospectively identifying ovulation and, thus, the fertile period to increase the likelihood of conception. Whilst timed intercourse may increase conception rates and reduce unnecessary intervention and costs, there may be associated adverse aspects including time consumption and stress. Ovulation prediction methods used for timing intercourse include urinary hormone measurement (luteinizing hormone (LH), estrogen), tracking basal body temperatures, cervical mucus investigation, calendar charting and ultrasonography. This review considered the evidence from randomised controlled trials for the use of timed intercourse on positive pregnancy outcomes. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and risks of ovulation prediction methods for timing intercourse on conception in couples trying to conceive. 
Search methods
We searched the following sources to identify relevant randomised controlled trials, the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, LILACS, Web of Knowledge, the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Register Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. Furthermore, we manually searched the references of relevant articles. The search was not restricted by language or publication status. The last search was on 5 August 2014. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction or comparing different methods of ovulation prediction for timing intercourse against each other in couples trying to conceive. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and extracted the data. The primary review outcomes were cumulative live birth and adverse events (such as quality of life, depression and stress). Secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, pregnancy (clinical or self‐reported pregnancy, not yet confirmed by ultrasound) and time to conception. We combined data to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for the main comparisons using GRADE methods. 
Main results
We included five RCTs (2840 women or couples) comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction. Unfortunately one large study (n = 1453) reporting live birth and pregnancy had not published outcome data by randomised group and therefore could not be analysed. Consequently, four RCTs (n = 1387) were included in the meta‐analysis. The evidence was of low to very low quality. Main limitations for downgrading the evidence included imprecision, lack of reporting clinically relevant outcomes and the high risk of publication bias. 
One study reported live birth, but the sample size was too small to draw any relevant conclusions on the effect of timed intercourse (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.41, 1 RCT, n = 17, very low quality). One study reported stress as an adverse event. There was no evidence of a difference in levels of stress (mean difference 1.98, 95 CI% ‐0.87 to 4.83, 1 RCT, n = 77, low level evidence). No other studies reported adverse events. Two studies reported clinical pregnancy. There was no evidence of a difference in clinical pregnancy rates (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.12, 2 RCTs, n = 177, I2 = 0%, low level evidence). This suggested that if the chance of a clinical pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction is assumed to be 16%, the chance of success following timed intercourse would be between 9% and 33%.Four studies reported pregnancy rate (clinical or self‐reported pregnancy). Timed intercourse was associated with higher pregnancy rates compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction in couples trying to conceive (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.71, 4 RCTs, n = 1387, I2 = 0%, very low level evidence). This suggests that if the chance of a pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction is assumed to be 13%, the chance following timed intercourse would be between 14% and 23%. Subgroup analysis by duration of subfertility showed no difference in effect between couples trying to conceive for < 12 months versus couples trying for ≥ 12 months. One trial reported time to conception data and showed no evidence of a difference in time to conception. 
Authors' conclusions
There are insufficient data available to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of timed intercourse for the outcomes of live birth, adverse events and clinical pregnancy. Timed intercourse may improve pregnancy rates (clinical or self‐reported pregnancy, not yet confirmed by ultrasound) compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction. The quality of this evidence is low to very low and therefore findings should be regarded with caution. There is a high risk of publication bias, as one large study remains unpublished 8 years after recruitment finished. Further research is required, reporting clinically relevant outcomes (live birth, clinical pregnancy rates and adverse effects), to determine if timed intercourse is safe and effective in couples trying to conceive.","Ovulation prediction methods for timing intercourse in couples trying to conceive

Onychomycosis refers to fungal infections of the nail apparatus that may cause pain, discomfort, and disfigurement. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2007; a substantial amount of new research warrants a review exclusively on toenails. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical and mycological effects of topical drugs and device‐based therapies for toenail onychomycosis. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of topical and device‐based therapies for onychomycosis in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by positive cultures, direct microscopy, or histological nail examination. Eligible comparators were placebo, vehicle, no treatment, or an active topical or device‐based treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were complete cure rate (normal‐looking nail plus fungus elimination, determined with laboratory methods) and number of participants reporting treatment‐related adverse events. 
Main results
We included 56 studies (12,501 participants, average age: 27 to 68 years), with mainly mild‐to‐moderate onychomycosis without matrix involvement (where reported). Participants had more than one toenail affected. Most studies lasted 48 to 52 weeks; 23% reported disease duration (variable). Thirty‐five studies specifically examined dermatophyte‐caused onychomycosis. Forty‐three studies were carried out in outpatient settings. Most studies assessed topical treatments, 9% devices, and 11% both. 
We rated three studies at low risk of bias across all domains. The most common high‐risk domain was performance bias. We present results for key comparisons, where treatment duration was 36 or 48 weeks, and clinical outcomes were measured at 40 to 52 weeks. 
Based on two studies (460 participants), compared with vehicle, ciclopirox 8% lacquer may be more effective in achieving complete cure (risk ratio (RR) 9.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72 to 50.14; low‐quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 3.15, 95% CI 1.93 to 5.12; moderate‐quality evidence). Ciclopirox lacquer may lead to increased adverse events, commonly application reactions, rashes, and nail alteration (e.g. colour, shape). However, the 95% CI indicates that ciclopirox lacquer may actually make little or no difference (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.92; low‐quality evidence). 
Efinaconazole 10% solution is more effective than vehicle in achieving complete cure (RR 3.54, 95% CI 2.24 to 5.60; 3 studies, 1716 participants) and clinical cure (RR 3.07, 95% CI 2.08 to 4.53; 2 studies, 1655 participants) (both high‐quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.94; 3 studies, 1716 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Risk of adverse events (such as dermatitis and vesicles) was slightly higher with efinaconazole (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.20; 3 studies, 1701 participants; high‐quality evidence). No other key comparison measured clinical cure. 
Based on two studies, compared with vehicle, tavaborole 5% solution is probably more effective in achieving complete cure (RR 7.40, 95% CI 2.71 to 20.24; 1198 participants), but probably has a higher risk of adverse events (application site reactions were most commonly reported) (RR 3.82, 95% CI 1.65 to 8.85; 1186 participants (both moderate‐quality evidence)). Tavaborole improves mycological cure (RR 3.40, 95% CI 2.34 to 4.93; 1198 participants; high‐quality evidence). 
Moderate‐quality evidence from two studies (490 participants) indicates that P‐3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) is probably more effective than the comparators ciclopirox 8% lacquer or amorolfine 5% in achieving complete cure (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.32 to 4.48), but there is probably little or no difference between the treatments in achieving mycological cure (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.37). We found no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.92; 2 studies, 487 participants; low‐quality evidence). The most common events were erythema, rash, and burning. 
Three studies (112 participants) compared 1064‐nm Nd:YAG laser to no treatment or sham treatment. We are uncertain if there is a difference in adverse events (very low‐quality evidence) (two studies; 85 participants). There may be little or no difference in mycological cure at 52 weeks (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.85; 2 studies, 85 participants; low‐quality evidence). Complete cure was not measured. 
One study (293 participants) compared luliconazole 5% solution to vehicle. We are uncertain whether luliconazole leads to higher rates of complete cure (very low‐quality evidence). Low‐quality evidence indicates there may be little or no difference in adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.16) and there may be increased mycological cure with luliconazole; however, the 95% CI indicates that luliconazole may make little or no difference to mycological cure (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.97). Commonly‐reported adverse events were dry skin, paronychia, eczema, and hyperkeratosis, which improved or resolved post‐treatment. 
Authors' conclusions
Assessing complete cure, high‐quality evidence supports the effectiveness of efinaconazole, moderate‐quality evidence supports P‐3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) and tavaborole, and low‐quality evidence supports ciclopirox 8% lacquer. We are uncertain whether luliconazole 5% solution leads to complete cure (very low‐quality evidence); this outcome was not measured by the 1064‐nm Nd:YAG laser comparison. Although evidence supports topical treatments, complete cure rates with topical treatments are relatively low. 
We are uncertain if 1064‐nm Nd:YAG laser increases adverse events compared with no treatment or sham treatment (very low‐quality evidence). Low‐quality evidence indicates that there is no difference in adverse events between P‐3051 (ciclopirox hydrolacquer), luliconazole 5% solution, and their comparators. Ciclopirox 8% lacquer may increase adverse events (low‐quality evidence). High‐ to moderate‐quality evidence suggests increased adverse events with efinaconazole 10% solution or tavaborole 5% solution. 
We downgraded evidence for heterogeneity, lack of blinding, and small sample sizes. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of device‐based treatments, which were under‐represented; 80% of studies assessed topical treatments, but we were unable to evaluate all of the currently relevant topical treatments. 
Future studies of topical and device‐based therapies should be blinded, with patient‐centred outcomes and an adequate sample size. They should specify the causative organism and directly compare treatments.","Topical and device‐based treatments for toenail onychomycosis
What is the aim of this review?
To assess the clinical and mycological effects of topical drugs and device‐based therapies for toenail onychomycosis. 
What did we do?
We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS databases up to May 2019. We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials. 
What did we find?
We included 56 studies (12,501 participants, average age: 27 to 68 years), with mainly mild‐to‐moderate onychomycosis without matrix involvement (where reported). Participants had more than one toenail affected. Most studies lasted 48 to 52 weeks; 23% reported disease duration (variable). Thirty‐five studies specifically examined dermatophyte‐caused onychomycosis. Forty‐three studies were carried out in outpatient settings. Most studies assessed topical treatments, 9% devices, and 11% both. 
We rated three studies at low risk of bias across all domains. The most common high‐risk domain was performance bias. We present results for key comparisons, where treatment duration was 36 or 48 weeks, and clinical outcomes were measured at 40 to 52 weeks. 
Based on two studies (460 participants), compared with vehicle, ciclopirox 8% lacquer may be more effective in achieving complete cure (RR 9.29, 95% CI 1.72 to 50.14; low‐quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 3.15, 95% CI 1.93 to 5.12; moderate‐quality evidence). Ciclopirox lacquer may lead to increased adverse events, commonly application reactions, rashes, and nail alteration (e.g. colour, shape). However, the 95% CI indicates that ciclopirox lacquer may actually make little or no difference (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.92; low‐quality evidence).

Low‐back pain (LBP) is a common condition and imposes a substantial economic burden upon people living in industrialized societies. A large proportion of people with chronic LBP use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), visit CAM practitioners, or both. Several herbal medicines have been purported for use in treating people with LBP. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of herbal medicine for non‐specific LBP.
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases up to September 2014: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Clinical Trials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Portal and PubMed; checked reference lists in review articles, guidelines and retrieved trials; and personally contacted individuals with expertise in this area. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining adults (over 18 years of age) suffering from acute, sub‐acute, or chronic non‐specific LBP. The interventions were herbal medicines which we defined as plants used for medicinal purposes in any form. Primary outcome measures were pain and function. 
Data collection and analysis
A library scientist with the Cochrane Back Review Group conducted the database searches. One review author contacted content experts and acquired relevant citations. We downloaded full references and abstracts of the identified studies and retrieved a hard copy of each study for final inclusion decisions. Two review authors assessed risk of bias, GRADE criteria (GRADE 2004), and CONSORT compliance and a random subset were compared to assessments by a third individual. Two review authors assessed clinical relevance and resolved any disagreements by consensus. 
Main results
We included 14 RCTs (2050 participants) in this review. One trial on Solidago chilensis M. (Brazilian arnica) (20 participants) found very low quality evidence of reduction in perception of pain and improved flexibility with application of Brazilian arnica‐containing gel twice daily as compared to placebo gel. Capsicum frutescens cream or plaster probably produces more favourable results than placebo in people with chronic LBP (three trials, 755 participants, moderate quality evidence). Based on current evidence, it is not clear whether topical capsicum cream is more beneficial for treating people with acute LBP compared to placebo (one trial, 40 participants, low quality evidence). Another trial found equivalence of C. frutescens cream to a homeopathic ointment (one trial, 161 participants, very low quality evidence). Daily doses of Harpagophytum procumbens (devil's claw), standardized to 50 mg or 100 mg harpagoside, may be better than placebo for short‐term improvements in pain and may reduce use of rescue medication (two trials, 315 participants, low quality evidence). Another H. procumbens trial demonstrated relative equivalence to 12.5 mg per day of rofecoxib (Vioxx®) but was of very low quality (one trial, 88 participants, very low quality). Daily doses of Salix alba (white willow bark), standardized to 120 mg or 240 mg salicin, are probably better than placebo for short‐term improvements in pain and rescue medication (two trials, 261 participants, moderate quality evidence). An additional trial demonstrated relative equivalence to 12.5 mg per day of rofecoxib (one trial, 228 participants) but was graded as very low quality evidence. S. alba minimally affected platelet thrombosis versus a cardioprotective dose of acetylsalicylate (one trial, 51 participants). One trial (120 participants) examining Symphytum officinale L. (comfrey root extract) found low quality evidence that a Kytta‐Salbe comfrey extract ointment is better than placebo ointment for short‐term improvements in pain as assessed by VAS. Aromatic lavender essential oil applied by acupressure may reduce subjective pain intensity and improve lateral spine flexion and walking time compared to untreated participants (one trial, 61 participants,very low quality evidence). No significant adverse events were noted within the included trials. 
Authors' conclusions
C. frutescens (Cayenne) reduces pain more than placebo. Although H. procumbens, S. alba, S. officinale L., S. chilensis, and lavender essential oil also seem to reduce pain more than placebo, evidence for these substances was of moderate quality at best. Additional well‐designed large trials are needed to test these herbal medicines against standard treatments. In general, the completeness of reporting in these trials was poor. Trialists should refer to the CONSORT statement extension for reporting trials of herbal medicine interventions.","Herbal medicine for non‐specific low‐back pain

A pressure ulcer is defined as ""an area of localized injury to the skin and/or underlying tissue, usually over a bony prominence, as a result of pressure, or pressure in combination with shear"". The use of phototherapy ‐ that is, light (or laser) used as an adjuvant, non‐surgical intervention, with the aim of having a therapeutic effect on healing ‐ has increased recently. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of phototherapy on the healing of pressure ulcers.
Search methods
In January 2014, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid EMBASE; Ovid MEDLINE (In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); and EBSCO CINAHL. We did not restrict the search by language or publication date. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of phototherapy (in addition to standard treatment) with sham phototherapy (in addition to standard treatment), another type of phototherapy (in addition to standard treatment) or standard or conventional treatment alone. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed studies for relevance and design according to the selection criteria, extracted data and evaluated study quality. The authors made attempts to obtain missing data by contacting study authors. Disagreement was resolved by consensus and discussion with a third review author. 
Main results
We identified seven RCTs involving 403 participants. All the trials were at unclear risk of bias. Trials compared the use of phototherapy with standard care only (six trials) or sham phototherapy (one trial). Only one of the trials included a third arm in which another type of phototherapy was applied. Overall, there was insufficient evidence to determine the relative effects of phototherapy for healing pressure ulcers. Time to complete healing was reported in three studies. Two studies showed the ultraviolet (UV) treated group had a shorter mean time to complete healing than the control group (mean difference ‐2.13 weeks (95% CI ‐3.53 to ‐0.72, P value 0.003)). One study reported that the laser group had a longer mean time to complete healing than the control group (mean difference 5.77 weeks; 95% CI ‐0.25 to 11.79). However, this result should be interpreted with caution, as these were small studies and the findings may have been due to chance. Three studies reported proportions of ulcers healed with a variety of results. One study reported a different outcome measure, and the other two studies had different treatment durations. These variations did not allow us to pool the studies and draw any conclusions as to whether phototherapy is effective or not. Adverse effects were reported in only two studies that compared phototherapy with control; the risk ratio for adverse events was imprecise. One study reported risk ratio (RR) 0.72 (95%CI 0.18 to 2.80). However, another study reported RR 0.89 (95% CI: 0.71 to 1.12) based on the number of events in each group, rather than the number of people with events. Among five studies reporting the rate of change in ulcer area, three studies found no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Pooling was not undertaken because of differences in outcome measures reported. The results were based on data from trials with unclear risk of bias for which generation of the randomisation sequence, concealment allocation and blinding of outcome assessors were unclear. No studies reported on quality of life, length of hospital stay, pain or cost. 
Authors' conclusions
We are very uncertain as to the effects of phototherapy in treating pressure ulcers. The quality of evidence is very low due to the unclear risk of bias and small number of trials available for analysis. The possibility of benefit or harm of this treatment cannot be ruled out. Further research is recommended.","Phototherapy for pressure ulcers
What is the aim of this review?
Pressure ulcers are areas of skin and tissue damage caused by pressure or friction. They are common in people who are bedridden or have limited mobility. Phototherapy is the use of light (or laser) as an adjuvant, non‐surgical intervention, with the aim of having a therapeutic effect on healing. This review aimed to determine the effects of phototherapy on the healing of pressure ulcers. 
What did we do?
We searched for studies that compared the effects of phototherapy with standard treatment, sham phototherapy (phototherapy that looks like phototherapy but does not have any therapeutic effect), another type of phototherapy or standard treatment alone.

People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of pneumococcal disease, especially pneumonia, as well as acute exacerbations with associated morbidity and healthcare costs. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy of injectable pneumococcal vaccination for preventing pneumonia in persons with COPD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways COPD Trials Register and the databases CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase, using prespecified terms. Searches are current to November 2016. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing injectable pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) or pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV) versus a control or alternative vaccine type in people with COPD. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. For meta‐analyses, we subgrouped studies by vaccine type. 
Main results
For this update, we added five studies (606 participants), meaning that the review now includes a total of 12 RCTs involving 2171 participants with COPD. Average age of participants was 66 years, male participants accounted for 67% and mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 1.2 L (five studies), 54% predicted (four studies). We assessed risks of selection, attrition and reporting bias as low, and risks of performance and detection bias as moderate. 
Compared with control, the vaccine group had a lower likelihood of developing community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP) (odds ratio (OR) 0.59 , 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.85; six studies, n = 1372; GRADE: moderate), but findings did not differ specifically for pneumococcal pneumonia (Peto OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.31; three studies, n = 1158; GRADE: low). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) (preventing one episode of CAP) was 19 (95% CI 13 to 52). Mortality from cardiorespiratory causes did not differ between vaccine and control groups (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.66; three studies, n = 888; GRADE: moderate), nor did all‐cause mortality differ (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.40; five studies, n = 1053; GRADE: moderate). The likelihood of hospital admission for any cause, or for cardiorespiratory causes, did not differ between vaccine and control groups. Vaccination significantly reduced the likelihood of a COPD exacerbation (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.93; four studies, n = 446; GRADE: moderate). The NNTB to prevent a patient from experiencing an acute exacerbation was 8 (95% CI 5 to 58). Only one study (n = 181) compared the efficacy of different vaccine types ‐ 23‐valent PPV versus 7‐valent PCV ‐ and reported no differences for CAP, all‐cause mortality, hospital admission or likelihood of a COPD exacerbation, but investigators described a greater likelihood of some mild adverse effects of vaccination with PPV‐23. 
Authors' conclusions
Injectable polyvalent pneumococcal vaccination provides significant protection against community‐acquired pneumonia, although no evidence indicates that vaccination reduced the risk of confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia, which was a relatively rare event. Vaccination reduced the likelihood of a COPD exacerbation, and moderate‐quality evidence suggests the benefits of pneumococcal vaccination in people with COPD. Evidence was insufficient for comparison of different pneumococcal vaccine types.","Pneumococcal vaccination for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination for preventing pneumonia in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
Background 
Pneumonia is a common and serious infection in people with COPD. Pneumococcal pneumonia is a type of pneumonia caused by a bacterium called Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is also known as pneumococcus. Pneumococcal vaccines are available to help prevent pneumococcal pneumonia. 
Study characteristics 
We included 12 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 2171 people with COPD. The trials compared pneumococcal vaccination with a control or alternative vaccine type. The trials were conducted in the United States, Europe and Australia. The trials were conducted between 1999 and 2016. 
Key results 
Pneumococcal vaccination reduced the likelihood of developing community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP) (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.85; six studies, n = 1372; GRADE: moderate). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) (preventing one episode of CAP) was 19 (95% CI 13 to 52). Pneumococcal vaccination reduced the likelihood of a COPD exacerbation (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.93; four studies, n = 446; GRADE: moderate). The NNTB to prevent a patient from experiencing an acute exacerbation was 8 (95% CI 5 to 58). Pneumococcal vaccination did not reduce the likelihood of hospital admission for any cause, or for cardiorespiratory causes.

Lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated pathological spinal conditions. It frequently afflicts the elderly population. 
Objectives
To systematically review the evidence for the effectiveness of nonoperative treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication. 
Search methods
CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Index to Chiropractic Literature (ICL) databases were searched up to June 2012. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials published in English, in which at least one arm provided data on nonoperative treatments 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Risk of bias in each study was independently assessed by two review authors using the 12 criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (Furlan 2009). Dichotomous outcomes were expressed as relative risk, continuous outcomes as mean difference or standardized mean difference; uncertainty was expressed with 95% confidence intervals. If possible a meta‐analysis was performed, otherwise results were described qualitatively. GRADE was used to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
From the 8635 citations screened, 56 full‐text articles were assessed and 21 trials (1851 participants) were included. There was very low‐quality evidence from six trials that calcitonin is no better than placebo or paracetamol, regardless of mode of administration or outcome assessed. From single small trials, there was low‐quality evidence for prostaglandins, and very low‐quality evidence for gabapentin or methylcobalamin that they improved walking distance. There was very low‐quality evidence from a single trial that epidural steroid injections improved pain, function, and quality of life, up to two weeks, compared with home exercise or inpatient physical therapy. There was low‐quality evidence from a single trial that exercise is of short‐term benefit for leg pain and function compared with no treatment. There was low and very low‐quality evidence from six trials that multimodal nonoperative treatment is less effective than indirect or direct surgical decompression with or without fusion. A meta‐analysis of two trials comparing direct decompression with or without fusion to multimodal nonoperative care found no significant difference in function at six months (mean difference (MD) ‐3.66, 95% CI ‐10.12 to 2.80) and one year (MD ‐6.18, 95% CI ‐15.03 to 2.66), but at 24 months a significant difference was found favouring decompression (MD ‐4.43, 95% CI ‐7.91 to ‐0.96). 
Authors' conclusions
Moderate and high‐quality evidence for nonoperative treatment is lacking and thus prohibits recommendations for guiding clinical practice. Given the expected exponential rise in the prevalence of lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication, large high‐quality trials are urgently needed.","Nonoperative treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication

High intake of added sugar have been suggested to impact the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Knowledge on the subject can contribute to preventing CVD. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of a high versus low‐added sugar consumption for primary prevention of CVD in the general population. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (CPCI‐S) on 2 July 2021. We also conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal for ongoing or unpublished trials. The search was performed together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We imposed no restriction on language of publication or publication status. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over trials, that compared different levels of added sugar intake. Exclusion criteria were: participants aged below 18 years; diabetes mellitus (type 1 and 2); and previous CVD. Primary outcomes were incident cardiovascular events (coronary, carotid, cerebral and peripheral arterial disease) and all‐cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL‐cholesterol, HDL‐cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose and adverse events (gastrointestinal symptoms and impaired dental health). 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 21 RCTs (1110 participants completing the interventions) examining the effects of different levels of added sugar intake with a mean duration of 14 weeks. The study participants were generally described as healthy and the mean age ranged from 22 to 57 years. 
No studies reported on cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality. There was minimal effect of low intake of added sugar on total cholesterol levels (MD 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.21; I² = 0%; 16 studies; 763 participants; low certainty of evidence) and triglycerides (MD 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17; I² = 3%; 14 studies; 725 participants) but no evidence of effect on LDL‐cholesterol and HDL‐cholesterol. There was minimal effect on diastolic blood pressure (MD 1.52, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.37; I² = 0%; 13 studies; 873 participants) and on systolic blood pressure (MD 1.44, 95% 0.08 to 2.80; I² = 27%, 14 studies; 873 participants; low certainty of evidence), but no evidence of effect on fasting plasma glucose. 
Only one study reported on dental health, with no events. No other trials reported adverse events (impaired dental health or gastrointestinal symptoms). 
All results were judged as low‐quality evidence according to GRADE. The risk of bias was generally unclear, five studies were classified at an overall low risk of bias (low risk in at least four domains, not including other bias). 
Authors' conclusions
No trials investigating the effect of added sugar on cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality were identified in our searches. Evidence is uncertain whether low intake of added sugar has an effect on risk factors for CVD; the effect was small and the clinical relevance is, therefore, uncertain. Practical ways to achieve reductions in dietary added sugar includes following current dietary recommendations. 
Future trials should have longer follow‐up time and report on all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular events in order to clarify the effect of added sugar on these outcomes. Future trials should also aim for more direct interventions and preferably be more independent of industry funding.","Added sugar and cardiovascular disease

PW‐led interventions show promising benefits in improving outcomes for CMDs, PND, PTS, harmful alcohol/substance use, and dementia carers in LMICs.","Community‐based primary‐level workers (PWs) for mental health in low‐ and middle‐income countries 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of PW‐led treatments for persons with mental health symptoms in LMICs, compared to usual care. 
Background 
Mental health problems are a major public health problem in LMICs. There is a gap in mental health service delivery in LMICs, and PWs are an important strategy for addressing this gap. PWs are people who work in the community and provide mental health services to people in their communities. PWs can include primary health professionals (PHPs), lay health workers (LHWs), and community non‐health professionals (CPs). 
Study characteristics 
We included 95 trials (72 new since 2013) from 30 LMICs (25 trials from 13 LICs). The trials were conducted between 1978 and 2019. The trials were of people with CMDs, PND, PTS, harmful alcohol/substance use, and dementia carers. The PWs included PHPs, LHWs, and CPs. The interventions were LHW‐led, PHP‐led, or collaborative‐care. The interventions were compared to usual care. 
Key results 
PW‐led interventions showed promising benefits in improving outcomes for CMDs, PND, PTS, harmful alcohol/substance use, and dementia carers in LMICs. PW‐led interventions may increase recovery from CMDs (RR 1.29, 95%CI 1.06 to 1.56), reduce prevalence of CMDs (RR 0.42, 95%CI 0.18 to 0.96), reduce symptoms of CMDs (SMD ‐0.59, 95%CI ‐1.01 to ‐0.16), improve QOL (SMD 0.51, 95%CI 0.34 to 0.69), reduce functional impairment (SMD ‐0.47, 95%CI ‐0.8 to ‐0.15), reduce risk of suicide ideation/attempts (risk of suicide ideation/attempts), and may have uncertain effects on SU.

The use of technology in healthcare settings is on the increase and may represent a cost‐effective means of delivering rehabilitation. Reductions in treatment time, and delivery in the home, are also thought to be benefits of this approach. Children and adolescents with brain injury often experience deficits in memory and executive functioning that can negatively affect their school work, social lives, and future occupations. Effective interventions that can be delivered at home, without the need for high‐cost clinical involvement, could provide a means to address a current lack of provision. 
We have systematically reviewed studies examining the effects of technology‐based interventions for the rehabilitation of deficits in memory and executive functioning in children and adolescents with acquired brain injury. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of technology‐based interventions compared to placebo intervention, no treatment, or other types of intervention, on the executive functioning and memory of children and adolescents with acquired brain injury. 
Search methods
We ran the search on the 30 September 2015. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), EMBASE Classic + EMBASE (OvidSP), ISI Web of Science (SCI‐EXPANDED, SSCI, CPCI‐S, and CPSI‐SSH), CINAHL Plus (EBSCO), two other databases, and clinical trials registers. We also searched the internet, screened reference lists, and contacted authors of included studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing the use of a technological aid for the rehabilitation of children and adolescents with memory or executive‐functioning deficits with placebo, no treatment, or another intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts identified by the search strategy. Following retrieval of full‐text manuscripts, two review authors independently performed data extraction and assessed the risk of bias. 
Main results
Four studies (involving 206 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this review.
Three studies, involving 194 participants, assessed the effects of online interventions to target executive functioning (that is monitoring and changing behaviour, problem solving, planning, etc.). These studies, which were all conducted by the same research team, compared online interventions against a 'placebo' (participants were given internet resources on brain injury). The interventions were delivered in the family home with additional support or training, or both, from a psychologist or doctoral student. The fourth study investigated the use of a computer program to target memory in addition to components of executive functioning (that is attention, organisation, and problem solving). No information on the study setting was provided, however a speech‐language pathologist, teacher, or occupational therapist accompanied participants. 
Two studies assessed adolescents and young adults with mild to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), while the remaining two studies assessed children and adolescents with moderate to severe TBI. 
Risk of bias 
We assessed the risk of selection bias as low for three studies and unclear for one study. Allocation bias was high in two studies, unclear in one study, and low in one study. Only one study (n = 120) was able to conceal allocation from participants, therefore overall selection bias was assessed as high. 
One study took steps to conceal assessors from allocation (low risk of detection bias), while the other three did not do so (high risk of detection bias). 
Primary outcome 1: Executive functioning: Technology‐based intervention versus placebo 
Results from meta‐analysis of three studies (n = 194) comparing online interventions with a placebo for children and adolescents with TBI, favoured the intervention immediately post‐treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.66 to ‐0.09; P = 0.62; I2 = 0%). (As there is no 'gold standard' measure in the field, we have not translated the SMD back to any particular scale.) This result is thought to represent only a small to medium effect size (using Cohen’s rule of thumb, where 0.2 is a small effect, 0.5 a medium one, and 0.8 or above is a large effect); this is unlikely to have a clinically important effect on the participant. 
The fourth study (n = 12) reported differences between the intervention and control groups on problem solving (an important component of executive functioning). No means or standard deviations were presented for this outcome, therefore an effect size could not be calculated. 
The quality of evidence for this outcome according to GRADE was very low. This means future research is highly likely to change the estimate of effect. 
Primary outcome 2: Memory 
One small study (n = 12) reported a statistically significant difference in improvement in sentence recall between the intervention and control group following an eight‐week remediation programme. No means or standard deviations were presented for this outcome, therefore an effect size could not be calculated. 
Secondary outcomes 
Two studies (n = 158) reported on anxiety/depression as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and were included in a meta‐analysis. We found no evidence of an effect with the intervention (mean difference ‐5.59, 95% CI ‐11.46 to 0.28; I2 = 53%). The GRADE quality of evidence for this outcome was very low, meaning future research is likely to change the estimate of effect. 
A single study sought to record adverse events and reported none. Two studies reported on use of the intervention (range 0 to 13 and 1 to 24 sessions). One study reported on social functioning/social competence and found no effect. The included studies reported no data for other secondary outcomes (that is quality of life and academic achievement). 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides low‐quality evidence for the use of technology‐based interventions in the rehabilitation of executive functions and memory for children and adolescents with TBI. As all of the included studies contained relatively small numbers of participants (12 to 120), our findings should be interpreted with caution. The involvement of a clinician or therapist, rather than use of the technology, may have led to the success of these interventions. Future research should seek to replicate these findings with larger samples, in other regions, using ecologically valid outcome measures, and reduced clinician involvement.","Technology‐based interventions for the rehabilitation of executive functioning and memory in children and adolescents with acquired brain injury

Traditionally inhaled treatment for asthma has used separate preventer and reliever therapies. The combination of formoterol and budesonide in one inhaler has made possible a single inhaler for both prevention and relief of symptoms (single inhaler therapy or SiT). 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of budesonide and formoterol in a single inhaler for maintenance and reliever therapy in asthma compared with maintenance with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (alone or as part of current best practice) and any reliever therapy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register in February 2013.
Selection criteria
Parallel, randomised controlled trials of 12 weeks or longer in adults and children with chronic asthma. Studies had to assess the combination of formoterol and budesonide as SiT, against a control group that received inhaled steroids and a separate reliever inhaler. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 13 trials involving 13,152 adults and one of the trials also involved 224 children (which have been separately reported). All studies were sponsored by the manufacturer of the SiT inhaler. We considered the nine studies assessing SiT against best practice to be at a low risk of selection bias, but a high risk of detection bias as they were unblinded. 
In adults whose asthma was not well‐controlled on ICS, the reduction in hospital admission with SiT did not reach statistical significance (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.44, eight trials, N = 8841, low quality evidence due to risk of detection bias in open studies and imprecision). The rates of hospital admission were low; for every 1000 people treated with current best practice six would experience a hospital admission over six months compared with between three and eight treated with SiT. The odds of experiencing exacerbations needing treatment with oral steroids were lower with SiT compared with control (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.98, eight trials, N = 8841, moderate quality evidence due to risk of detection bias). For every 100 adults treated with current best practice over six months, seven required a course of oral steroids, whilst for SiT there would be six (95% CI 5 to 7). The small reduction in time to first severe exacerbation needing medical intervention was not statistically significant (hazard ratio (HR) 0.94; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.04, five trials, N = 7355). Most trials demonstrated a reduction in the mean total daily dose of ICS with SiT (mean reduction was based on self‐reported data from patient diaries and ranged from 107 to 385 µg/day). Withdrawals due to adverse events were more common in people treated with SiT in comparison to current best practice (OR 2.85; 95% CI 1.89 to 4.30, moderate quality evidence due to risk of detection bias). 
Three studies including 4209 adults compared SiT with higher dose budesonide maintenance and terbutaline for symptom relief. The studies were considered as low risk of bias. The run‐in for these studies involved withdrawal of LABA, and patients were recruited who were symptomatic during run‐in. The reduction in the odds of hospitalisation with SiT compared with higher dose ICS did not reach statistical significance (Peto OR; 0.56; 95% CI 0.28 to 1.09, moderate quality evidence due to imprecision). Fewer patients on SiT needed a course of oral corticosteroids (OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.64, high quality evidence). For every 100 adults treated with ICS over 11 months, 18 required a course of oral steroids, whilst for SiT there would be 11 (95% CI 9 to 12). Withdrawals due to adverse events were less common in people treated with SiT in comparison to higher dose budesonide maintenance (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.93, high quality evidence). 
One study included children (N = 224), in which SiT was compared with higher dose budesonide. There was a significant reduction in participants who needed an increase in their inhaled steroids with SiT, but there were only two hospitalisations for asthma and no separate data on courses of oral corticosteroids. Less inhaled and oral corticosteroids were used in the SiT group and the annual height gain was also 1 cm greater in the SiT group, (95% CI 0.3 cm to 1.7 cm). 
The results for fatal serious adverse events were too rare to rule out either treatment being harmful. There was no significant difference found in non‐fatal serious adverse events for any of the comparisons. 
Authors' conclusions
Single inhaler therapy has now been demonstrated to reduce exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids against current best practice strategies and against a fixed higher dose of inhaled steroids. The strength of evidence that SiT reduces hospitalisation against these same treatments is weak. There were more discontinuations due to adverse events on SiT compared to current best practice, but no significant differences in serious adverse events. Our confidence in these conclusions is limited by the open‐label design of the trials, and by the unknown adherence to treatment in the current best practice arms of the trials. 
Single inhaler therapy can reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations needing oral corticosteroids in comparison with fixed dose maintenance ICS and separate relief medication. The reduced odds of exacerbations with SiT compared with higher dose ICS should be viewed in the context of the possible impact of LABA withdrawal during study run‐in. This may have made the study populations more likely to respond to SiT. 
Single inhaler therapy is not currently licensed for children under 18 years of age in the United Kingdom and there is currently very little research evidence for this approach in children or adolescents.","Single inhaler therapy for asthma 
Background 
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. It is characterised by airway obstruction, inflammation and mucus production. The main symptoms of asthma are wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough. 
Asthma is treated with a combination of inhaled and oral medications. Inhaled medications are used to control the inflammation of the airways and to relieve symptoms. Oral medications are used to reduce inflammation and to prevent asthma attacks. 
Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most commonly used inhaled medication for asthma. They are taken daily to prevent asthma attacks. They are usually combined with a long‐acting beta‐agonist (LABA) to relieve symptoms.

Work participation of patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA) is important not only economically but also for physical and psychological health. There is no Cochrane Review to date on studies of non‐pharmacological interventions specifically aimed at preventing job loss in people with IA. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of non‐pharmacological interventions that aim to prevent job loss, work absenteeism or improve work functioning for employees with IA (rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), other spondylarthritis (SpA) or IA associated with connective tissue diseases, such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)). 
Search methods
We searched the following databases from inception up to 30 April 2014; The Cochrane Library (including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, i.e. CENTRAL and DARE), MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE (Embase.com), CINAHL (EbSCOhost), ClinicalTrials.gov and PsycINFO (ProQuest). We did not impose language restrictions in the search. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated interventions aimed at preventing job loss in adults of working age (18 to 65 years) diagnosed with IA, including RA, AS, PsA, SpA or other types of IA. Primary outcomes were job loss and sickness absenteeism and the secondary outcome was work functioning. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included RCTs. 
Main results
We included three RCTs with a total of 414 participants at risk of job loss. The majority of participants had IA, most with RA and to a lesser degree AS. The interventions aimed to prevent job loss and improve work functioning in several ways: firstly by evaluating work changes or adaptations and secondly by providing any person‐directed interventions including vocational counselling, advice or education. Interventions directly targeted at the work environment were minimal and included workplace visits (one trial) or any actions by an occupational physician (one trial). The duration or dose of the interventions varied from two 1.5‐hour sessions (one RCT) over five months, two consultation and multidisciplinary treatments during three months (one RCT), to six to eight individual or group sessions over six months (also one RCT). All participants were recruited through rheumatology clinics, both in or outside hospitals. Included trials investigated job loss (n = two RCTs; 382 participants), work absenteeism and work functioning (n = one RCT; 32 participants). Overall, we evaluated the two smaller trials as having a high risk of bias and the large trial as having a low risk of bias. Trials showed marked differences in how they performed on risk of bias items, particularly on performance bias. 
We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach and judged there to be very low quality evidence across the three reported outcomes. Of the two RCTs investigating job loss, the larger one (n = 242 participants) reported a large statistically significant reduction in job loss (relative risk (RR) = 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.68) and the other RCT (n = 140) reported similar effects in both groups, although the CI was very wide (RR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.06). The latter one probably suffered from performance bias and we judged it to have a high risk of bias. The one small trial investigating sickness absenteeism found uncertain results at six months' follow‐up (MD = ‐2.42 days, 95% CI ‐5.03 to 0.19). Finally, in the same small trial investigating work functioning using the Rheumatoid Arthritis‐Work Instability Scale (RA‐WIS), there was a moderate improvement of intermediate term work functioning (six months; scale range 0 to 23; mean improvement ‐4.67 points, 95% CI ‐8.43 to ‐0.91). We identified no adverse effects in the publications of the three trials. 
Authors' conclusions
This Cochrane review of three RCTs found very low quality evidence overall for job loss prevention interventions having an effect on job loss, work absenteeism and work functioning in workers with inflammatory arthritis. While this review highlights that further high quality RCTs are required, the results suggest that these strategies have potential to be effective.","Non‐pharmacological interventions to prevent job loss in people with inflammatory arthritis 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of non‐pharmacological interventions aimed at preventing job loss, work absenteeism or improving work functioning in people with inflammatory arthritis (IA). 
Background 
IA is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect joints, tendons, ligaments and other tissues. It is associated with pain, stiffness, fatigue and disability. IA can affect people's ability to work and can lead to job loss. People with IA may experience difficulties in finding and keeping a job, and may be more likely to take time off work due to illness or disability. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 30 April 2014. We included three RCTs with a total of 414 participants at risk of job loss. The majority of participants had IA, most with RA and to a lesser degree AS.

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 3, 2012. Caffeine has been added to common analgesics such as paracetamol, ibuprofen, and aspirin, in the belief that it enhances analgesic efficacy. Evidence to support this belief is limited and often based on invalid comparisons. 
Objectives
To assess the relative efficacy of a single dose of an analgesic plus caffeine against the same dose of the analgesic alone, without restriction on the analgesic used or the pain condition studied. We also assessed serious adverse events. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE from inception to 28 August 2014, the Oxford Pain Relief Database, and also carried out Internet searches and contacted pharmaceutical companies known to have carried out trials that have not been published. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised, double‐blind studies that compared a single dose of analgesic plus caffeine with the same dose of the analgesic alone in the treatment of acute pain. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and quality of studies, and extracted data. Any disagreements or uncertainties were settled by discussion with a third review author. We sought any validated measure of analgesic efficacy, but particularly the number of participants experiencing at least 50% of the maximum possible pain relief over four to six hours, participants reporting a global evaluation of treatment of very good or excellent, or headache relief after two hours. We pooled comparable data to look for a statistically significant difference, and calculated numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) with caffeine. We also looked for any numerical superiority associated with the addition of caffeine, and information about any serious adverse events. 
Main results
We identified no new studies with available results for this update. The earlier review included 20 studies (7238 participants) in valid comparisons, but because we used different outcomes for some headache studies, the number of participants in the analyses of the effects of caffeine is now 4262 when previously it was 5243. The studies were generally of good methodological quality, using standard designs and mostly standard scales of pain measurement, although many of those treating postoperative pain were small. 
Most studies used paracetamol or ibuprofen, with 100 mg to 130 mg caffeine, and the most common pain conditions studied were postoperative dental pain, postpartum pain, and headache. There was a small but statistically significant benefit with caffeine used at doses of 100 mg or more, which was not dependent on the pain condition or type of analgesic. About 5% to 10% more participants achieve a good level of pain relief (at least 50% of the maximum over four to six hours) with the addition of caffeine, giving a NNT of about 14 (high quality evidence). 
Most comparisons individually demonstrated numerical superiority with caffeine, but not statistical superiority. One serious adverse event was reported with caffeine, but was considered unrelated to any study medication. 
We know of the existence of around 25 additional studies with almost 12,500 participants for which data for analysis were not obtainable. The additional analgesic effect of caffeine remained statistically significant but clinically less important even if all the known missing data had no effect; the bulk of the unobtainable data are reported to have similar results as this review. 
Authors' conclusions
The addition of caffeine (≥ 100 mg) to a standard dose of commonly used analgesics provides a small but important increase in the proportion of participants who experience a good level of pain relief.","Caffeine and pain relief
Caffeine is a stimulant that is found in coffee, tea, and chocolate. It is also added to some over‐the‐counter pain relievers. The idea is that caffeine will make pain relievers work better. This is called 'enhancing' the effect of the pain reliever. 
We wanted to find out if caffeine really does make pain relievers work better. We found 20 studies that compared pain relievers with and without caffeine. The studies included people with different types of pain, such as after dental surgery, after giving birth, or with headaches. 
The studies were generally of good quality, but some were small and some did not use standard scales of pain measurement. 
Most studies used paracetamol or ibuprofen, with 100 mg to 130 mg caffeine. The most common pain conditions studied were postoperative dental pain, postpartum pain, and headache. 
The results of the studies showed that caffeine may make pain relievers work better. About 5% to 10% more people experienced a good level of pain relief (at least 50% of the maximum over four to six hours) with the addition of caffeine. This means that for every 100 people who take a pain reliever with caffeine, about 5 to 10 more people will experience a good level of pain relief. 
The addition of caffeine may also make pain relievers work better for people with headaches. 
The addition of caffeine to a standard dose of commonly used analgesics provides a small but important increase in the proportion of participants who experience a good level of pain relief.

Injury to the abdomen can be blunt or penetrating. Abdominal injury can damage internal organs such as the liver, spleen, kidneys, intestine, and large blood vessels. There are controversies about the best approach to manage abdominal injuries. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of surgical and non‐surgical interventions in the management of abdominal trauma in a haemodynamically stable and non‐peritonitic abdomen. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, The Cochrane Library, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), EMBASE Classic+EMBASE (Ovid), ISI WOS (SCI‐EXPANDED, SSCI, CPCI‐S & CPSI‐SSH), CINAHL Plus (EBSCO), and clinical trials registers, and screened reference lists. We ran the most recent search on 17 September 2015. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of surgical interventions and non‐surgical interventions involving people with abdominal injury who were haemodynamically stable with no signs of peritonitis. The abdominal injury could be blunt or penetrating. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently applied the selection criteria. Data were extracted by two authors using a standard data extraction form, and are reported narratively. 
Main results
Two studies are included, which involved a total of 114 people with penetrating abdominal injuries. Both studies are at moderate risk of bias because the randomisation methods are not fully described, and the original study protocols are no longer available. The studies were undertaken in Finland between 1992 and 2002, by the same two researchers. 
In one study, 51 people were randomised to surgery or an observation protocol. None of the participants in the study died. Seven people had complications: 5 (18.5%) in the surgical group and 2 (8.3%) in the observation group; the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.42; Fischer's exact). Among the 27 people who had surgery, 6 (22.2%) surgeries were negative laparotomies, and 15 (55.6%) were non‐therapeutic. 
In the other study, 63 people were randomised to diagnostic laparoscopy (surgery) or an observation protocol. There were no deaths and no unnecessary surgeries in either group. Four people did not receive the intervention they were assigned. There was no difference in therapeutic operations between the two groups: 3 of 28 in the diagnostic laparoscopy group versus 1 of 31 in the observation protocol group (P = 0.337). 
Authors' conclusions
Based on the findings of 2 studies involving a total of 114 people, there is no evidence to support the use of surgery over an observation protocol for people with penetrating abdominal trauma who have no signs of peritonitis and are stable.","Surgical versus non‐surgical management of abdominal trauma in a haemodynamically stable and non‐peritonitic abdomen

The recommended management for neonates with a possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) is hospitalisation and treatment with intravenous antibiotics, such as ampicillin plus gentamicin. However, hospitalisation is often not feasible for neonates in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). Therefore, alternative options for the management of neonatal PSBI in LMICs needs to be evaluated. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of community‐based antibiotics for neonatal PSBI in LMICs on neonatal mortality and to assess whether the effects of community‐based antibiotics for neonatal PSBI differ according to the antibiotic regimen administered. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 3), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 16 April 2018), Embase (1980 to 16 April 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 16 April 2018). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised, quasi‐randomised and cluster‐randomised trials. For the first comparison, we included trials that compared antibiotics which were initiated and completed in the community to the standard hospital referral for neonatal PSBI in LMICs. For the second comparison, we included trials that compared simplified antibiotic regimens which relied more on oral antibiotics than intravenous antibiotics to the standard regimen of seven to 10 days of injectable penicillin/ampicillin with an injectable aminoglycoside delivered in the community to treat neonatal PSBI. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Group. The primary outcomes were all‐cause neonatal mortality and sepsis‐specific neonatal mortality. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
For the first comparison, five studies met the inclusion criteria. Community‐based antibiotic delivery for neonatal PSBI reduced neonatal mortality when compared to hospital referral only (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 0.99; 5 studies, n = 125,134; low‐quality evidence). There was, however, a high level of statistical heterogeneity (I² = 87%) likely, due to the heterogenous nature of the study settings as well as the fact that four of the studies provided various co‐interventions in conjunction with community‐based antibiotics. Community‐based antibiotic delivery for neonatal PSBI showed a possible effect on reducing sepsis‐specific neonatal mortality (typical RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.00; 2 studies, n = 40,233; low‐quality evidence). 
For the second comparison, five studies met the inclusion criteria. Using a simplified antibiotic approach resulted in similar rates of neonatal mortality when compared to the standard regimen of seven days of injectable procaine benzylpenicillin and injectable procaine benzylpenicillin and injectable gentamicin delivered in community‐settings for neonatal PSBI (typical RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.50; 3 studies, n = 3476; moderate‐quality evidence). In subgroup analysis, the simplified antibiotic regimen of seven days of oral amoxicillin and injectable gentamicin showed no difference in neonatal mortality (typical RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.51; 3 studies, n = 2001; moderate‐quality evidence). Two days of injectable benzylpenicillin and injectable gentamicin followed by five days of oral amoxicillin showed no difference in neonatal mortality (typical RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.65; 3 studies, n = 2036; low‐quality evidence). Two days of injectable gentamicin and oral amoxicillin followed by five days of oral amoxicillin showed no difference in neonatal mortality (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.85; 1 study, n = 893; moderate‐quality evidence). For fast breathing alone, seven days of oral amoxicillin resulted in no difference in neonatal mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.91; 1 study, n = 1406; low‐quality evidence). None of the studies in the second comparison reported the effect of a simplified antibiotic regimen on sepsis‐specific neonatal mortality. 
Authors' conclusions
Low‐quality data demonstrated that community‐based antibiotics reduced neonatal mortality when compared to the standard hospital referral for neonatal PSBI in resource‐limited settings. The use of co‐interventions, however, prevent disentanglement of the contribution from community‐based antibiotics. Moderate‐quality evidence showed that simplified, community‐based treatment of PSBI using regimens which rely on the combination of oral and injectable antibiotics did not result in increased neonatal mortality when compared to the standard treatment of using only injectable antibiotics. Overall, the evidence suggests that simplified, community‐based antibiotics may be efficacious to treat neonatal PSBI when hospitalisation is not feasible. However, implementation research is recommended to study the effectiveness and scale‐up of simplified, community‐based antibiotics in resource‐limited settings.","Community‐based antibiotics for neonatal bacterial infection in low‐ and middle‐income countries

Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are common in children and can involve both upper and lower airways. Many children experience frequent ARTI episodes or recurrent respiratory tract infections (RRTIs) in early life, which creates challenges for paediatricians, primary care physicians, parents and carers of children. 
In China, Astragalus (Huang qi), alone or in combination with other herbs, is used by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners in the form of a water extract, to reduce the risk of ARTIs; it is believed to stimulate the immune system. Better understanding of the therapeutic mechanisms of Astragalus may provide insights into ARTI prevention, and consequently reduced antibiotic use. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of oral Astragalus for preventing frequent episodes of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children in community settings.

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 12, 2015), MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to 31 December 2015), Embase (Elsevier) (1974 to 31 December 2015), AMED (Ovid) (1985 to 31 December 2015), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1979 to 31 December 2015) and Chinese Scientific Journals full text database (CQVIP) (1989 to 31 December 2015), China Biology Medicine disc (CBM 1976 to 31 December 2015) and Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform (WanFang) (1998 to 31 December 2015). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral Astragalus as a sole Chinese herbal preparation with placebo to prevent frequent episodes of ARTIs in children. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures for this review. We assessed search results to identify relevant studies. We planned to extract data using standardised forms. Disagreements were to be resolved through discussion. Risk of bias was to be assessed using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We planned to use mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and risk ratio (RR) or odds ratio (OR) to analyse dichotomous data, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
Main results
We identified 6080 records: 3352 from English language databases, 2724 from Chinese databases, and four from other sources. Following initial screening and deduplication, we obtained 120 full‐text papers for assessment. Of these, 21 were not RCTs; 55 did not meet the inclusion criteria because: participants were aged over 14 years; definition was not included for recurrent or frequent episodes;Astragalus preparation was not an intervention; Astragalus preparation was in the formula but was not the sole agent; the Astragalus preparation was not administered orally; or Astragalus was used for treatment rather than prevention of ARTI. A further 44 studies were excluded because they were not placebo‐controlled, although other inclusion criteria were fulfilled. 
No RCTs met our inclusion criteria.
Authors' conclusions
We found insufficient evidence to enable assessment of the effectiveness and safety of oral Astragalus as a sole intervention to prevent frequent ARTIs in children aged up to 14 years.","Oral Astragalus for preventing frequent episodes of acute respiratory tract infections in children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on whether oral Astragalus is effective and safe for preventing frequent episodes of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children aged up to 14 years. 
Background 
Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are common in children and can involve both upper and lower airways. Many children experience frequent ARTIs or recurrent respiratory tract infections (RRTIs) in early life, which creates challenges for paediatricians, primary care physicians, parents and carers of children. 
In China, Astragalus (Huang qi), alone or in combination with other herbs, is used by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners in the form of a water extract, to reduce the risk of ARTIs; it is believed to stimulate the immune system. Better understanding of the therapeutic mechanisms of Astragalus may provide insights into ARTI prevention, and consequently reduced antibiotic use.

In most pregnancies that miscarry, arrest of embryonic or fetal development occurs some time (often weeks) before the miscarriage occurs. Ultrasound examination can reveal abnormal findings during this phase by demonstrating anembryonic pregnancies or embryonic or fetal death. Treatment has traditionally been surgical but medical treatments may be effective, safe, and acceptable, as may be waiting for spontaneous miscarriage. This is an update of a review first published in 2006. 
Objectives
To assess, from clinical trials, the effectiveness and safety of different medical treatments for the termination of non‐viable pregnancies. 
Search methods
For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (24 October 2018) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials comparing medical treatment with another treatment (e.g. surgical evacuation), or placebo, or no treatment for early pregnancy failure. Quasi‐randomised studies were excluded. Cluster‐randomised trials were eligible for inclusion, as were studies reported in abstract form, if sufficient information was available to assess eligibility. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Forty‐three studies (4966 women) were included. The main interventions examined were vaginal, sublingual, oral and buccal misoprostol, mifepristone and vaginal gemeprost. These were compared with surgical management, expectant management, placebo, or different types of medical interventions were compared with each other. The review includes a wide variety of different interventions which have been analysed across 23 different comparisons. Many of the comparisons consist of single studies. We limited the grading of the quality of evidence to two main comparisons: vaginal misoprostol versus placebo and vaginal misoprostol versus surgical evacuation of the uterus. Risk of bias varied widely among the included trials. The quality of the evidence varied between the different comparisons, but was mainly found to be very‐low or low quality. 
Vaginal misoprostol versus placebo 
Vaginal misoprostol may hasten miscarriage when compared with placebo: e.g. complete miscarriage (5 trials, 305 women, risk ratio (RR) 4.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.01 to 5.94; low‐quality evidence). No trial reported on pelvic infection rate for this comparison. Vaginal misoprostol made little difference to rates of nausea (2 trials, 88 women, RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.43 to 4.40; low‐quality evidence), diarrhoea (2 trials, 88 women, RR 2.21, 95% CI 0.35 to 14.06; low‐quality evidence) or to whether women were satisfied with the acceptability of the method (1 trial, 32 women, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.64; low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether vaginal misoprostol reduces blood loss (haemoglobin difference > 10 g/L) (1 trial, 50 women, RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.12; very‐low quality) or pain (opiate use) (1 trial, 84 women, RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 101.11; very‐low quality), because the quality of the evidence for these outcomes was found to be very low. 
Vaginal misoprostol versus surgical evacuation 
Vaginal misoprostol may be less effective in accomplishing a complete miscarriage compared to surgical management (6 trials, 943 women, average RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.50; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.03, I² = 46%; low‐quality evidence) and may be associated with more nausea (1 trial, 154 women, RR 21.85, 95% CI 1.31 to 364.37; low‐quality evidence) and diarrhoea (1 trial, 154 women, RR 40.85, 95% CI 2.52 to 662.57; low‐quality evidence). There may be little or no difference between vaginal misoprostol and surgical evacuation for pelvic infection (1 trial, 618 women, RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.37; low‐quality evidence), blood loss (post‐treatment haematocrit (%) (1 trial, 50 women, mean difference (MD) 1.40%, 95% CI ‐3.51 to 0.71; low‐quality evidence), pain relief (1 trial, 154 women, RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.46; low‐quality evidence) or women's satisfaction/acceptability of method (1 trial, 45 women, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.11; low‐quality evidence). 
Other comparisons 
Based on findings from a single trial, vaginal misoprostol was more effective at accomplishing complete miscarriage than expectant management (614 women, RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.45). There was little difference between vaginal misoprostol and sublingual misoprostol (5 trials, 513 women, average RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.16; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.10, I² = 871%; or between oral and vaginal misoprostol in terms of complete miscarriage at less than 13 weeks (4 trials, 418 women), average RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.03; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.13, I² = 90%). However, there was less abdominal pain with vaginal misoprostol in comparison to sublingual (3 trials, 392 women, RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.74). A single study (46 women) found mifepristone to be more effective than placebo: miscarriage complete by day five after treatment (46 women, RR 9.50, 95% CI 2.49 to 36.19). However the quality of this evidence is very low: there is a very serious risk of bias with signs of incomplete data and no proper intention‐to‐treat analysis in the included study; and serious imprecision with wide confidence intervals. Mifepristone did not appear to further hasten miscarriage when added to a misoprostol regimen (3 trials, 447 women, RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.47). 
Authors' conclusions
Available evidence from randomised trials suggests that medical treatment with vaginal misoprostol may be an acceptable alternative to surgical evacuation or expectant management. In general, side effects of medical treatment were minor, consisting mainly of nausea and diarrhoea. There were no major differences in effectiveness between different routes of administration. Treatment satisfaction was addressed in only a few studies, in which the majority of women were satisfied with the received intervention. Since the quality of evidence is low or very low for several comparisons, mainly because they included only one or two (small) trials; further research is necessary to assess the effectiveness, safety and side effects, optimal route of administration and dose of different medical treatments for early fetal death.","Medical treatment for early pregnancy failure 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of different medical treatments for early pregnancy failure (miscarriage before 13 weeks of pregnancy). 
Background 
Miscarriage is a common event in pregnancy. In most cases, the embryo or fetus dies before the miscarriage occurs. In some cases, the miscarriage occurs when the embryo or fetus is already dead. In most cases, the miscarriage occurs before 13 weeks of pregnancy. 
Medical treatment for early pregnancy failure 
Medical treatment for early pregnancy failure is a way of ending a pregnancy that does not involve surgery. Medical treatment for early pregnancy failure can be done in the clinic or at home. 
Medical treatment for early pregnancy failure can be done with different drugs. The most common drugs used for medical treatment of early pregnancy failure are misoprostol, mifepristone, and gemeprost. 
The review authors found 43 studies (4966 women) that compared medical treatment with another treatment (e.g. surgical evacuation), or placebo, or no treatment for early pregnancy failure. 
The review authors found that vaginal misoprostol may hasten miscarriage when compared with placebo. Vaginal misoprostol may be less effective in accomplishing a complete miscarriage compared to surgical management. Vaginal misoprostol may be associated with more nausea and diarrhoea. Vaginal misoprostol may be associated with less abdominal pain. Vaginal misoprostol may be associated with less blood loss. Vaginal misoprostol may be associated with less pain relief. Vaginal misoprostol may be associated with less women's satisfaction/acceptability of method. 
The review authors found that mifepristone may be more effective than placebo.

Constipation is a common symptom experienced during pregnancy. It has a range of consequences from reduced quality of life and perception of physical health to haemorrhoids. An understanding of the effectiveness and safety of treatments for constipation in pregnancy is important for the clinician managing pregnant women. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions (pharmacological and non‐pharmacological) for treating constipation in pregnancy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (30 April 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We considered all published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs and quasi‐RCTs, evaluating interventions (pharmacological and non‐pharmacological) for constipation in pregnancy. Cross‐over studies were not eligible for inclusion in this review. Trials published in abstract form only (without full text publication) were not eligible for inclusion. 
We compared one intervention (pharmacological or non‐pharmacological) against another intervention, placebo or no treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. 
Main results
Four studies were included, but only two studies with a total of 180 women contributed data to this review. It was not clear whether they were RCTs or quasi‐RCTs because the sequence generation was unclear. We classified the overall risk of bias of three studies as moderate and one study as high risk of bias. No meta‐analyses were carried out due to insufficient data. 
There were no cluster‐RCTs identified for inclusion. Comparisons were available for stimulant laxatives versus bulk‐forming laxatives, and fibre supplementation versus no intervention. There were no data available for any other comparisons. 
During the review process we found that studies reported changes in symptoms in different ways. To capture all data available, we added a new primary outcome (improvement in constipation) ‐ this new outcome was not prespecified in our published protocol. 
Stimulant laxatives versus bulk‐forming laxatives 
No data were identified for any of this review's prespecified primary outcomes: pain on defecation, frequency of stools and consistency of stools. 
Compared to bulk‐forming laxatives, pregnant women who received stimulant laxatives (Senokot or Normax) had an improvement in constipation (risk ratio (RR) 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21 to 2.09; 140 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence), but also had more abdominal discomfort (RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.15 to 4.73; 140 women, one study, low quality of evidence), and a borderline difference in diarrhoea (RR 4.50, 95% CI 1.01 to 20.09; 140 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence). In addition, there was no clear difference in women's satisfaction (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.46; 140 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence). 
One of the stimulant laxatives, Normax (dioctyl sodium sulphosuccinate and dihydroxy anthraquinone) is no longer used for the treatment of constipation in pregnant women (and the package information advises that it should not be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding). We therefore carried out a non‐prespecified sensitivity analysis with the data for Senokot and Normax presented separately. Results for Senokot and Normax were very similar, thus results for the individual drugs largely reflected findings for the combined analysis, although when individual drugs were compared with bulk‐forming laxatives there was no longer a clear difference between groups in terms of abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea. 
No usable data were identified for any of this review's secondary outcomes: quality of life; dehydration; electrolyte imbalance; acute allergic reaction; or asthma. 
Fibre supplementation versus no intervention 
Pregnant women who received fibre supplementation had a higher frequency of stools compared to no intervention (mean difference (MD) 2.24 times per week, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.52; 40 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence). Fibre supplementation was associated with improved stool consistency as defined by trialists (hard stool decreased by 11% to 14%, normal stool increased by 5% to 10%, and loose stool increased by 0% to 6%). 
No usable data were reported for either the primary outcomes of pain on defecation and improvement in constipation or any of this review's secondary outcomes as listed above. 
Quality 
Five outcomes were assessed with the GRADE software: improvement in constipation, frequency of stools, abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea and women's satisfaction. These were assessed to be of moderate quality except for abdominal discomfort which was assessed to be of low quality. The results should therefore be interpreted with caution. There were no data available for evaluation of pain on defecation or consistency of stools. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to comprehensively assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions (pharmacological and non‐pharmacological) for treating constipation in pregnancy, due to limited data (few studies with small sample size and no meta‐analyses). Compared with bulk‐forming laxatives, stimulant laxatives appear to be more effective in improvement of constipation (moderate quality evidence), but are accompanied by an increase in diarrhoea (moderate quality evidence) and abdominal discomfort (low quality evidence) and no difference in women's satisfaction (moderate quality evidence). Additionally, fibre supplementation may increase frequency of stools compared with no intervention (moderate quality evidence), although these results were of moderate risk of bias. 
There were no data for a comparison of other types of interventions, such as osmotic laxatives, stool softeners, lubricant laxatives and enemas and suppositories. 
More RCTs evaluating interventions for treating constipation in pregnancy are needed. These should cover different settings and evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions (including fibre, osmotic, and stimulant laxatives) on improvement in constipation, pain on defecation, frequency of stools and consistency of stools.","Constipation in pregnancy

Hyperbilirubinaemia occurs in approximately two‐thirds of all newborns during the first days of life and is frequently treated with phototherapy. Although generally seen as safe, there is rising concern regarding phototherapy and its potentially damaging effects on DNA and increased side effects particularly for preterm infants. Other methods, such as enteral feeding supplementation with prebiotics, may have an effective use in the management of hyperbilirubinaemia in neonates. 
Objectives
To determine whether administration of prebiotics reduces the incidence of hyperbilirubinaemia among term and preterm infants compared with enteral supplementation of milk with distilled water/placebo or no supplementation. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 5), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 14 June 2018), Embase (1980 to 14 June 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 14 June 2018). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
We considered all RCTs that studied neonates comparing enteral feeding supplementation with prebiotics versus distilled water/placebo or no supplementation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers screened papers and extracted data from selected papers. We used a fixed‐effect method in combining the effects of studies that were sufficiently similar. We then used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
Three small studies evaluating 154 infants were included in this review. One study reported a significant reduction in the risk of hyperbilirubinaemia and rate of treatment with phototherapy associated with enteral supplementation with prebiotics (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.58 to 0.97; one study, 50 infants; low‐quality evidence). Meta‐analyses of two studies showed no significant difference in maximum plasma unconjugated bilirubin levels in infants with prebiotic supplementation (mean difference (MD) 0.14 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐0.91 to 1.20, I² = 81%, P = 0.79; two studies, 78 infants; low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of a significant difference in duration of phototherapy between the prebiotic and control groups, which was only reported by one study (MD 0.10 days, 95% CI ‐2.00 to 2.20; one study, 50 infants; low‐quality evidence). The meta‐analyses of two studies demonstrated a significant reduction in the length of hospital stay (MD ‐10.57 days, 95% CI ‐17.81 to ‐3.33; 2 studies, 78 infants; I² = 0%, P = 0.004; low‐quality evidence). Meta‐analysis of the three studies showed a significant increase in stool frequency in the prebiotic groups (MD 1.18, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.46, I² = 90%; 3 studies, 154 infants; high‐quality evidence). No significant difference in mortality during hospital stay after enteral supplementation with prebiotics was reported (typical RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.19; I² = 6%, P = 0.95; 2 studies; 78 infants; low‐quality evidence). There were no reports of the need for exchange transfusion and incidence of acute bilirubin encephalopathy, chronic bilirubin encephalopathy, and major neurodevelopmental disability in the included studies. None of the included studies reported any side effects. 
Authors' conclusions
Current studies are unable to provide reliable evidence about the effectiveness of prebiotics on hyperbilirubinaemia. Additional large, well‐designed RCTs should be undertaken in neonates that compare effects of enteral supplementation with prebiotics on neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia with supplementation of milk with any other placebo (particularly distilled water) or no supplementation.","Prebiotics for hyperbilirubinaemia in neonates
Background 
Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia is a common condition in newborns. It is frequently treated with phototherapy, which is a safe and effective treatment for hyperbilirubinaemia. However, phototherapy may have adverse effects on DNA and increase the risk of side effects, particularly in preterm infants. Prebiotics are substances that promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. They may have a beneficial effect on the gut microbiota and may reduce the risk of hyperbilirubinaemia. 
Objectives 
To determine whether administration of prebiotics reduces the incidence of hyperbilirubinaemia among term and preterm infants compared with enteral supplementation of milk with distilled water/placebo or no supplementation. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Neonatal Register (2018, Issue 5) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 5) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised trials.

Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility tests are expected to reduce the time to clinically important results of a blood culture. This might enable clinicians to better target therapy to a person's needs, and thereby, improve health outcomes (mortality, length of hospital stay), and reduce unnecessary prescribing of broad‐spectrum antibiotics; thereby reducing antimicrobial resistance rates. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of rapid susceptibility testing versus standard susceptibility testing for bloodstream infections (BSIs). 
Search methods
To identify studies with selected outcomes, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, LILACS, and two trials registries, between 1987 and October 2020. We used 'bloodstream infection' and 'antimicrobial susceptibility tests' as search terms. We had no language or publication status limitations. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (with a time‐to‐result of ≤ 8 hours) versus conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing in people with a BSI caused by any bacteria, as identified by a positive blood culture. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened references, full‐text reports of potentially relevant studies, extracted data from the studies, and assessed risk of bias. Any disagreement was discussed and resolved with a third review author. For mortality, a dichotomous outcome, we extracted the number of events in each arm, and presented a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare rapid susceptibility testing to conventional methods. We used Review Manager 5.4 to meta‐analyse the data. For other outcomes, which are time‐to‐event outcomes (time‐to‐discharge from hospital, time‐to‐first appropriate antibiotic change), we conducted qualitative narrative synthesis, due to heterogeneity of outcome measures.

We included six trials, with 1638 participants. For rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.46; 6 RCTs, 1638 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In subgroup analysis, for rapid genotypic or molecular antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.49; 4 RCTs, 1074 participants; low‐certainty evidence). For phenotypic rapid susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups  (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.35; 2 RCTs, 564 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
In qualitative analysis, rapid susceptibility testing may make little or no difference in time‐to‐discharge (4 RCTs, 1165 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In qualitative analysis, rapid genotypic susceptibility testing compared to conventional testing may make little or no difference in time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic (3 RCTs, 929 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In subgroup analysis, rapid phenotypic susceptibility testing compared to conventional testing may improve time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic (RR ‐17.29, CI ‐45.05 to 10.47; 2 RCTs, 564 participants; low‐certainty evidence).  
Authors' conclusions
The theoretical benefits of rapid susceptibility testing have not been demonstrated to directly improve mortality, time‐to‐discharge, or time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic in these randomized studies. Future large prospective studies should be designed to focus on the most clinically meaningful outcomes, and aim to optimize blood culture pathways.","Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing for bloodstream infections 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on whether rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (antimicrobial susceptibility tests performed in less than 8 hours) is better than standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing (antimicrobial susceptibility tests performed in more than 8 hours) for people with bloodstream infections (BSIs). 
Background 
Bloodstream infections are infections of the blood. They are caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses. Bloodstream infections are a common cause of serious illness and death in people with other medical conditions. People with bloodstream infections are often treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics are drugs that kill or stop bacteria from growing. However, some bacteria are resistant to antibiotics. This means that antibiotics do not kill or stop the bacteria from growing. When antibiotics do not work, people with bloodstream infections may die. Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing is a way of finding out which antibiotics will kill or stop the bacteria from growing. Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing can be done in less than 8 hours. This means that doctors can start giving people with bloodstream infections the right antibiotics sooner. This may help people with bloodstream infections to recover more quickly and to avoid dying. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing with standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing for people with bloodstream infections. We included six studies that involved 1638 people. The studies were conducted in different countries and at different times. The studies were of different sizes and different designs. The studies were of different quality. 
Key results 
We found little or no difference in mortality between people who received rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing and people who received standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing. We found little or no difference in time to discharge from hospital between people who received rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing and people who received standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing. We found little or no difference in time to first appropriate antibiotic change between people who received rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing and people who received standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing. We found little or no difference in time to appropriate antibiotic change between people who received rapid genotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing and people who received standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing. We found little or no difference in time to appropriate antibiotic change between people who received rapid phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing and people who received standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is of low certainty for mortality, time to discharge, and time to first appropriate antibiotic change. The evidence is of low certainty for time to appropriate antibiotic change.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common bacterial infection among young children in the United States. There are limitations and concerns over its treatment with antibiotics and surgery and so effective preventative measures are attractive. A potential preventative measure is xylitol, a natural sugar substitute that reduces the risk of dental decay. Xylitol can reduce the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae) and Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae) to nasopharyngeal cells in vitro. This is an update of a review first published in 2011. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of xylitol to prevent AOM in children aged up to 12 years. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (to Issue 12, 2015), MEDLINE (1950 to January 2016), Embase (1974 to January 2016), CINAHL (1981 to January 2016), LILACS (1982 to January 2016), Web of Science (2011 to January 2016) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (2000 to January 2016). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs of children aged 12 years or younger where xylitol supplementation was compared with placebo or no treatment to prevent AOM. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials from search results, assessed and rated study quality and extracted relevant data for inclusion in the review. We contacted trial authors to request missing data. We noted data on any adverse events of xylitol. We extracted data on relevant outcomes and estimated the effect size by calculating risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
Main results
We identified five clinical trials that involved 3405 children for inclusion. For this 2016 update, we identified one new trial for inclusion. This trial was systematically reviewed but due to several sources of heterogeneity, was not included in the meta‐analysis. The remaining four trials were of adequate methodological quality. In three RCTs that involved a total of 1826 healthy Finnish children attending daycare, there is moderate quality evidence that xylitol (in any form) can reduce the risk of AOM from 30% to around 22% compared with the control group (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.88). Among the reasons for dropouts, there were no significant differences in abdominal discomfort and rash between the xylitol and the control groups. Xylitol was not effective in reducing AOM among healthy children during a respiratory infection (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.53; moderate quality evidence) or among otitis‐prone healthy children (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.21; low‐quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
There is moderate quality evidence showing that the prophylactic administration of xylitol among healthy children attending daycare centres can reduce the occurrence of AOM. There is inconclusive evidence with regard to the efficacy of xylitol in preventing AOM among children with respiratory infection, or among otitis‐prone children. The meta‐analysis was limited because data came from a small number of studies, and most were from the same research group.","Xylitol for preventing acute otitis media in children

Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) is the second most common entrapment neuropathy after carpal tunnel syndrome. Treatment may be conservative or surgical, but optimal management remains controversial. This is an update of a review first published in 2010 and previously updated in 2012. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of conservative and surgical treatment in ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE). We intended to test whether: 
‐ surgical treatment is effective in reducing symptoms and signs and in increasing nerve function; 
‐ conservative treatment is effective in reducing symptoms and signs and in increasing nerve function; 
‐ it is possible to identify the best treatment on the basis of clinical, neurophysiological, or nerve imaging assessment. 
Search methods
On 31 May 2016 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL Plus, and LILACS. We also searched PEDro (14 October 2016), and the papers cited in relevant reviews. On 4 July 2016 we searched trials registries for ongoing or unpublished trials. 
Selection criteria
The review included only randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs evaluating people with clinical symptoms suggesting the presence of UNE. We included trials evaluating all forms of surgical and conservative treatments. We considered studies regarding therapy of UNE with or without neurophysiological evidence of entrapment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts of references retrieved from the searches and selected all potentially relevant studies. The review authors independently extracted data from included trials and assessed trial quality. We contacted trial investigators for any missing information. 
Main results
We identified nine RCTs (587 participants) for inclusion in the review, of which three studies were found at this update. The sequence generation was inadequate in one study and not described in three studies. We performed two meta‐analyses to evaluate the clinical (3 trials, 261 participants) and neurophysiological (2 trials, 101 participants) outcomes of simple decompression versus decompression with submuscular or subcutaneous transposition; four trials in total examined this comparison. 
We found no difference between simple decompression and transposition of the ulnar nerve for both clinical improvement (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.08; moderate‐quality evidence) and neurophysiological improvement (mean difference (in m/s) 1.47, 95% CI ‐0.94 to 3.87). The number of participants to clinically improve was 91 out of 131 in the simple decompression group and 97 out of 130 in the transposition group. Transposition showed a higher number of wound infections (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.85; moderate‐quality evidence). 
In one trial (47 participants), the authors compared medial epicondylectomy with anterior transposition and found no difference in clinical and neurophysiological outcomes. 
In one trial (48 participants), the investigators compared subcutaneous transposition with submuscular transposition and found no difference in clinical outcomes. 
In one trial (54 participants for 56 nerves treated), the authors found no difference between endoscopic and open decompression in improving clinical function. 
One trial (51 participants) assessed conservative treatment in clinically mild or moderate UNE. Based on low‐quality evidence, the trial authors found that information on avoiding prolonged movements or positions was effective in improving subjective discomfort. Night splinting and nerve gliding exercises in addition to information provision did not result in further improvement. 
One trial (55 participants) assessed the effectiveness of corticosteroid injection and found no difference versus placebo in improving symptoms at three months' follow‐up. 
Authors' conclusions
We found only two studies of treatment of ulnar neuropathy using conservative treatment as the comparator. The available comparative treatment evidence is not sufficient to support a multiple treatment meta‐analysis to identify the best treatment for idiopathic UNE on the basis of clinical, neurophysiological, and imaging characteristics. We do not know when to treat a person with this condition conservatively or surgically. Moderate‐quality evidence indicates that simple decompression and decompression with transposition are equally effective in idiopathic UNE, including when the nerve impairment is severe. Decompression with transposition is associated with more deep and superficial wound infections than simple decompression, also based on moderate‐quality evidence. People undergoing endoscopic surgery were more likely to have a haematoma. Evidence from one small RCT of conservative treatment showed that in mild cases, information on movements or positions to avoid may reduce subjective discomfort.","Treatment of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow

Young women, especially adolescents, often lack access to modern contraception. Reasons vary by geography and regional politics and culture. The projected 2015 birth rate in 'developing' regions was 56 per 1000 compared with 17 per 1000 for 'developed' regions. 
Objectives
To identify school‐based interventions that improved contraceptive use among adolescents
Search methods
Until 6 June 2016, we searched for eligible trials in PubMed, CENTRAL, ERIC, Web of Science, POPLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. 
Selection criteria
We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assigned individuals or clusters. The majority of participants must have been 19 years old or younger. 
The educational strategy must have occurred primarily in a middle school or high school. The intervention had to emphasize one or more effective methods of contraception. Our primary outcomes were pregnancy and contraceptive use. 
Data collection and analysis
We assessed titles and abstracts identified during the searches. One author extracted and entered the data into RevMan; a second author verified accuracy. We examined studies for methodological quality. 
For unadjusted dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the Mantel‐Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For cluster randomized trials, we used adjusted measures, e.g. OR, risk ratio, or difference in proportions. For continuous outcomes, we used the adjusted mean difference (MD) or other measures from the models. We did not conduct meta‐analysis due to varied interventions and outcome measures. 
Main results
The 11 trials included 10 cluster RCTs and an individually randomized trial. The cluster RCTs had sample sizes from 816 to 10,954; the median number of clusters was 24. Most trials were conducted in the USA and UK; one was from Mexico and one from South Africa. 
We focus here on the trials with moderate quality evidence and an intervention effect. Three addressed preventing pregnancy and HIV/STI through interactive sessions. One trial provided a multifaceted two‐year program. Immediately after year one and 12 months after year two, the intervention group was more likely than the standard‐curriculum group to report using effective contraception during last sex (reported adjusted ORs 1.62 ± standard error (SE) 0.22) and 1.76 ± SE 0.29), condom use during last sex (reported adjusted ORs 1.91 ± SE 0.27 and 1.68 ± SE 0.25), and less frequent sex without a condom in the past three months (reported ratios of adjusted means 0.50 ± SE 0.31 and 0.63 ± SE 0.23). Another trial compared multifaceted two‐year programs on sexual risk reduction and risk avoidance (abstinence‐focused) versus usual health education. At 3 months, the risk reduction group was less likely than the usual‐education group to report no condom use at last intercourse (reported adjusted OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.96) and sex without a condom in the last three months (reported adjusted OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.95). At 3 and after 15 months, the risk avoidance group was also less likely than the usual‐education group to report no condom use at last intercourse (reported adjusted ORs 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.93; and 0.61, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.85). At the same time points, the risk reduction group had a higher score than the usual‐education group for condom knowledge. The third trial provided a peer‐led program with eight interactive sessions. At 17 months, the intervention group was less likely than the teacher‐led group to report oral contraceptive use during last sex (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.91). This difference may not have been significant if the investigators had adjusted for the clustering. At 5 and 17 months, the peer‐led group had a greater mean increase in knowledge of HIV and pregnancy prevention compared with the control group. An additional trial showed an effect on knowledge only. The group with an emergency contraception (EC) session was more likely than the group without the EC unit to know the time limits for using hormonal EC (pill) and the non‐hormonal IUD as EC. 
Authors' conclusions
Since most trials addressed preventing STI/HIV and pregnancy, they emphasized condom use. However, several studies covered a range of contraceptive methods. The overall quality of evidence was low. Main reasons for downgrading the evidence were having limited information on intervention fidelity, analyzing a subsample rather than all those randomized, and having high losses.","School‐based interventions to improve contraceptive use among adolescents

Objectives
To evaluate the effects of Morita therapy for schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Trials Register, the Chongqing VIP Database, and the Wanfang Database (July 2008) for all relevant references. The first author of each included study was also contacted. 
We updated this search (July 2012) and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised clinical trials comparing Morita therapy with any other treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We reliably selected studies and extracted data. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated random‐effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat (NNT) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). 
Main results
We found 12 small, studies of medium‐poor quality (total n=1123). The standard care versus Morita therapy comparison (total n=761 people) had very low attrition (<2%, 10 RCTs, RR 1.01 CI 0.4 to 2.8). Mental state did tend to improve with Morita therapy (n=76, 1 RCT, number of >25‐30% decline in BPRS, RR 0.36 CI 0.1 to 0.9, NNT 5 CI 4 to 25). For negative symptoms data were inconsistent, with data from four short‐term trials favouring Morita therapy (n=323, WMD average endpoint SANS ‐12.94 CI ‐21.6 to ‐4.3), but heterogeneity was considerable (I2 =97%). In medium‐term studies, negative symptoms were favoured by Morita therapy (n=44, 1 RCT, RR >25% decline SANS 0.25 CI 0.1 to 0.8, NNT 3 CI 2 to 8). Morita therapy plus standard treatment did significantly improve the activities of daily living compared with standard treatment alone (n=104, 1 RCT, WMD ‐4.1 average endpoint ADL CI ‐7.7 to ‐0.6). Compared with a rehabilitation programme Morita therapy did not promote attrition (n=302, 2 RCTs, RR leaving early 1.00 CI 0.5 to 2.1). In two very similar studies Morita therapy showed better effect on mental state with lower BPRS score (n=278, 2 RCTs, WMD average endpoint BPRS ‐6.95 CI ‐9.3 to ‐4.6, I2 =0%), insight score (n=278, 2 RCTs, WMD average endpoint clinical judgement score ‐1.11 CI ‐1.3 to ‐0.9, I2 = 0%) and social functioning (n=278, WMD average endpoint IPROS ‐18.14 CI ‐21.3 to ‐15.0, I2 =0%). 
Authors' conclusions
Morita therapy for schizophrenia remains an experimental intervention. New trials are justified and specific plans for the design of future studies are outlined.

It is characterised by a range of symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, and social withdrawal. Morita therapy was founded in 1919 by Shoma Morita (1874‐1938). The therapy involves a behavioural structured program to encourage an outward perspective on life and increased social functioning.

Opioid dependence (OD) is an increasing clinical and public health problem worldwide. International guidelines recommend opioid substitution treatment (OST), such as methadone and buprenorphine, as first‐line medication treatment for OD. A negative aspect of OST is that the medication used can be diverted both through sale on the black market, and the unsanctioned use of medications. Daily supervised administration of medications used in OST has the advantage of reducing the risk of diversion, and may promote therapeutic engagement, potentially enhancing the psychosocial aspect of OST, but costs more and is more restrictive on the client than dispensing for off‐site consumption.

The objective of this systematic review is to compare the effectiveness of OST with supervised dosing relative to dispensing of medication for off‐site consumption. 
Search methods
We searched in Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science from inception up to April 2016. Ongoing and unpublished studies were searched via ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/). 
All searches included non‐English language literature. We handsearched references on topic‐related systematic reviews. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), and prospective controlled cohort studies, involving people who are receiving OST (methadone, buprenorphine) and comparing supervised dosing with dispensing of medication to be consumed away from the dispensing point, usually without supervision. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
Six studies (four RCTs and two prospective observational cohort studies), involving 7999 participants comparing supervised OST treatment with unsupervised treatment, met the inclusion criteria. The risk of bias was generally moderate across trials, but the results reported on outcomes that we planned to consider were limited. Overall, we judged the quality of the evidence from very low to low for all the outcomes. 
We found no difference in retention at any duration with supervised compared to unsupervised dosing (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12, 716 participants, four trials, low‐quality evidence) or in retention in the shortest follow‐up period, three months (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.05; 472 participants, three trials, low‐quality evidence). Additional data at 12 months from one observational study found no difference in retention between groups (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.14; n = 300).There was no difference in abstinence at the end of treatment (self‐reported drug use) (67% versus 60%, P = 0.33, 293 participants, one trial, very low‐quality evidence); and in diversion of medication (5% versus 2%, 293 participants, one trial, very low‐quality evidence). 
Regarding our secondary outcomes, we did not found a difference in the incidence of adverse effects in the supervised compared to unsupervised control group (RR 0.63; 96% CI 0.10 to 3.86; 363 participants, two trials, very low‐quality evidence). Data on severity of dependence were very limited (244 participants, one trial) and showed no difference between the two approaches. Data on deaths were reported in two studies. One trial reported two deaths in the supervised group (low‐quality evidence), while in the cohort study all‐cause mortality was found lower in regular supervision group (crude mortality rate 0.60 versus 0.81 per 100 person‐years), although after adjustment insufficient evidence existed to suggest that regular supervision was protective (mortality rate ratio = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.67 to 2.27). 
No studies reported pain symptoms, drug craving, aberrant opioid‐related behaviours, days of unsanctioned opioid use and overdose. 
Authors' conclusions
Take‐home medication strategies are attractive to treatment services due to lower costs, and place less restrictions on clients, but it is unknown whether they may be associated with increased risk of diversion and unsanctioned use of medication. There is uncertainty about the effects of supervised dosing compared with unsupervised medication due to the low and very low quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes of interest for this review. Data on defined secondary outcomes were similarly limited. More research comparing supervised and take‐home medication strategies is needed to support decisions on the relative effectiveness of these strategies. The trials should be designed and conducted with high quality and over a longer follow‐up period to support comparison of strategies at different stages of treatment. In particular, there is a need for studies assessing in more detail the risk of diversion and safety outcomes of using supervised OST to manage opioid dependence.","Supervised versus unsupervised medication for opioid dependence
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on whether supervised medication for opioid dependence (OST) is more effective than unsupervised medication for opioid dependence. 
Background 
Opioid dependence (OD) is an increasing clinical and public health problem worldwide. International guidelines recommend OST, such as methadone and buprenorphine, as first‐line medication treatment for OD. A negative aspect of OST is that the medication used can be diverted both through sale on the black market, and the unsanctioned use of medications. Daily supervised administration of medications used in OST has the advantage of reducing the risk of diversion, and may promote therapeutic engagement, potentially enhancing the psychosocial aspect of OST, but costs more and is more restrictive on the client than dispensing for off‐site consumption. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to April 2016. We included six studies (four RCTs and two prospective observational cohort studies) involving 7999 participants comparing supervised OST treatment with unsupervised treatment. The studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, and Australia. 
Key results 
We found no difference in retention at any duration with supervised compared to unsupervised dosing (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12, 716 participants, four trials, low‐quality evidence) or in retention in the shortest follow‐up period, three months (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.05; 472 participants, three trials, low‐quality evidence). Additional data at 12 months from one observational study found no difference in retention between groups (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.14; n = 300). There was no difference in abstinence at the end of treatment (self‐reported drug use) (67% versus 60%, P = 0.33, 293 participants, one trial, very low‐quality evidence); and in diversion of medication (5% versus 2%, 293 participants, one trial, very low‐quality evidence). 
Regarding our secondary outcomes, we did not find a difference in the incidence of adverse effects in the supervised compared to unsupervised control group (RR 0.63;",0.8848803043365479,0.8647083640098572,319,22,11.693898766848296,14.489489497964168,13.068067880699742,13

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is characterised by partial or complete upper airway obstruction during sleep. Approximately 1% to 4% of children are affected by OSA, with adenotonsillar hypertrophy being the most common underlying risk factor. Surgical removal of enlarged adenoids or tonsils is the currently recommended first‐line treatment for OSA due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Given the perioperative risk and an estimated recurrence rate of up to 20% following surgery, there has recently been an increased interest in less invasive alternatives to adenotonsillectomy. As the enlarged adenoids and tonsils consist of hypertrophied lymphoid tissue, anti‐inflammatory drugs have been proposed as a potential non‐surgical treatment option in children with OSA. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of anti‐inflammatory drugs for the treatment of OSA in children. 
Search methods
We identified trials from searches of the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL and MEDLINE (1950 to 2019). For identification of ongoing clinical trials, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anti‐inflammatory drugs against placebo in children between one and 16 years with objectively diagnosed OSA (apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) ≥ 1 per hour). 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently performed screening, data extraction, and quality assessment. We separately pooled results for the comparisons 'intranasal steroids' and 'montelukast' against placebo using random‐effects models. The primary outcomes for this review were AHI and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes included the respiratory disturbance index, desaturation index, respiratory arousal index, nadir arterial oxygen saturation, mean arterial oxygen saturation, avoidance of surgical treatment for OSA, clinical symptom score, tonsillar size, and adverse events. 
Main results
We included five trials with a total of 240 children aged one to 18 years with mild to moderate OSA (AHI 1 to 30 per hour). All trials were performed in specialised sleep medicine clinics at tertiary care centres. Follow‐up time ranged from six weeks to four months. 
Three RCTs (n = 137) compared intranasal steroids against placebo; two RCTs compared oral montelukast against placebo (n = 103). We excluded one trial from the meta‐analysis since the patients were not analysed as randomised. We also had concerns about selective reporting in another trial. 
We are uncertain about the difference in AHI (MD −3.18, 95% CI −8.70 to 2.35) between children receiving intranasal corticosteroids compared to placebo (2 studies, 75 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In contrast, children receiving oral montelukast had a lower AHI (MD −3.41, 95% CI −5.36 to −1.45) compared to those in the placebo group (2 studies, 103 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
We are uncertain whether the secondary outcomes are different between children receiving intranasal corticosteroids compared to placebo: desaturation index (MD −2.12, 95% CI −4.27 to 0.04; 2 studies, 75 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), respiratory arousal index (MD −0.71, 95% CI −6.25 to 4.83; 2 studies, 75 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and nadir oxygen saturation (MD 0.59%, 95% CI −1.09 to 2.27; 2 studies, 75 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Children receiving oral montelukast had a lower respiratory arousal index (MD −2.89, 95% CI −4.68 to −1.10; 2 studies, 103 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and nadir of oxygen saturation (MD 4.07, 95% CI 2.27 to 5.88; 2 studies, 103 participants; high‐certainty evidence) compared to those in the placebo group. We are uncertain, however, about the difference in desaturation index (MD −2.50, 95% CI −5.53 to 0.54; 2 studies, 103 participants; low‐certainty evidence) between the montelukast and placebo group. 
Adverse events were assessed and reported in all trials and were rare, of minor nature (e.g. nasal bleeding), and evenly distributed between study groups. 
No study examined the avoidance of surgical treatment for OSA as an outcome.
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence for the efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids for the treatment of OSA in children; they may have short‐term beneficial effects on the desaturation index and oxygen saturation in children with mild to moderate OSA but the certainty of the benefit on the primary outcome AHI, as well as the respiratory arousal index, was low due to imprecision of the estimates and heterogeneity between studies. 
Montelukast has short‐term beneficial treatment effects for OSA in otherwise healthy, non‐obese, surgically untreated children (moderate certainty for primary outcome and moderate and high certainty, respectively, for two secondary outcomes) by significantly reducing the number of apnoeas, hypopnoeas, and respiratory arousals during sleep. In addition, montelukast was well tolerated in the children studied. The clinical relevance of the observed treatment effects remains unclear, however, because minimal clinically important differences are not yet established for polysomnography‐based outcomes in children. 
Long‐term efficacy and safety data on the use of anti‐inflammatory medications for the treatment of OSA in childhood are still not available. In addition, patient‐centred outcomes like concentration ability, vigilance, or school performance have not been investigated yet. 
There are currently no RCTs on the use of other kinds of anti‐inflammatory medications for the treatment of OSA in children. 
Future RCTs should investigate sustainability of treatment effects, avoidance of surgical treatment for OSA, and long‐term safety of anti‐inflammatory medications for the treatment of OSA in children and include patient‐centred outcomes.","Anti‐inflammatory drugs for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea in children

The method of delivering a diagnosis of breast cancer to women has the potential to impact on their level of interpretation, patient recall and satisfaction. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of different methods when used to communicate a primary diagnosis of breast cancer to women. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register on 7th September 2006, Cochrane Consumers and Communication Group on 27th October 2006, MEDLINE (1966 to present), CINAHL (1982 to present), EMBASE OVID (1980 to present), British Nursing Index (Jan 1984 to present), PsycInfo (1967 to present), Dissertation Abstracts International (2004 to 2006), Library and Info Science Abstracts (LISA) (1969 to present), ISI Web of Knowledge (conference abstracts) and reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of women with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer receiving a diagnosis of primary breast cancer. Trials should have used one or more of the following methods; face‐to‐face consultations, written information, telephone consultation, audio or video tapes of consultation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion in the review. Studies were to have been assessed using standardised data extraction and quality assessment forms. 
Main results
The search strategies identified 2847 citations overall. A total of 30 citations appeared relevant however there were three duplicates which left 27 articles for further review. Articles reporting the same primary data accounted for 6 of the publications Brown 1997; Brown 1998; Brown 1999; Brown 2000; Hack 2000; Hack 2003 which left 23 original papers to be reviewed for inclusion. Of these, none met the inclusion criteria. Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality was therefore not possible. 
Authors' conclusions
The review question remains unanswered as there were no randomised trials of methods of communicating a diagnosis of breast cancer to women. The authors have considered the possible reasons for the lack of research studies in this area and have considered that it is perhaps unethical to randomise women at such a vulnerable time such as waiting for a diagnosis. The design of ethically sensitive research to examine this topic needs to be explored to inform future practice. As some papers reviewed by the authors related to the first consultation visit, where treatment options are discussed, perhaps a review which focused on the methods of communication at the first consultation visit would provide more reliable evidence for the effectiveness of methods of communication and overcome the ethical dilemmas previously mentioned.","Communicating a diagnosis of breast cancer to women

Antenatal day care units have been widely used as an alternative to inpatient care for women with pregnancy complications including mild and moderate hypertension, and preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes. 
Objectives
The objective of this review is to compare day care units with routine care or hospital admission for women with pregnancy complications in terms of maternal and perinatal outcomes, length of hospital stay, acceptability, and costs to women and health services providers. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (February 2009). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing day care with inpatient or routine care for women with complicated pregnancy. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently carried out data extraction and assessed studies for risk of bias. 
Main results
Three trials with a total of 504 women were included. For most outcomes it was not possible to pool results from trials in meta‐analyses as outcomes were measured in different ways. 
Compared with women in the ward/routine care group, women attending day care units were less likely to be admitted to hospital overnight (risk ratio 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.62). The average length of antenatal admission was shorter for women attending for day care, although outpatient attendances were increased for this group. There was evidence from one study that women attending for day care were significantly less likely to undergo induction of labour, but mode of birth was similar for women in both groups. For other outcomes there were no significant differences between groups.The evidence regarding the costs of different types of care was mixed; while the length of antenatal hospital stays were reduced, this did not necessarily translate into reduced health service costs. 
While most women tended to be satisfied with whatever care they received, women preferred day care compared with hospital admission. 
Authors' conclusions
Small studies suggest that there are no major differences in clinical outcomes for mothers or babies between antenatal day units or hospital admission, but women may prefer day care.","Antenatal day care units for women with pregnancy complications
